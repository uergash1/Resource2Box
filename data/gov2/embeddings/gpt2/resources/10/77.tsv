We've made  a list  of some places on our website and other     websites to check.        Q. I need to do a report on an oil spill other than the Exxon Valdez (my     teacher says it's too popular!). Can you please tell me where I can get information about other important oil     spills?        A. In the  Historical Incidents     database  on our Incident News website, you'll find information about many significant oil spills worldwide. Our     photo gallery also features  photos of major oil spills , along with a     little information about each of those spills. You also can read or download  reports describing oil and chemical spills  that we have responded to during the last 6 years, or view our  Oil Spill Case Histories  document ( PDF  file; 2.2 MB).        Elsewhere on the Web, you can see the  U.S. Coast Guard annual data and graphics on spills in the U.S. , Environment Canada's  Summaries of Spill Events in Canada  and its  Worldwide Tanker Spills database , a  list of major oil spills in Australia  from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the University of Wales Swansea website about the  1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Wales . You also can find information about  major oil spills in France  on the CEDRE website, including the Erika and Amoco Cadiz spills in Brittany, as well as brief descriptions of significant oil spills worldwide since 1967. The  International Tanker Owners Federation (ITOPF)  offers updates on current major spills, as well as links to online  oil spill case history information . For more information, we     suggest extending your information search to your local city or university library.        Q. Where in the world do most oil spills happen?        A. Oil spills happen all around the world. Analysts for the Oil Spill Intelligence Report (available at the  Aspen Publishers website ), who track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons), reported that spills in that size range have occurred in the waters of 112 nations since 1960. But they also reported (Etkin 1997) that oil spills happen more frequently in certain parts of the world. They identified the following ""hot spots"" for oil spills from vessels: the Gulf of Mexico (267 spills); the northeastern U.S. (140 spills); the Mediterranean Sea (127 spills); the Persian Gulf (108 spills); the North Sea (75 spills); Japan (60 spills); the Baltic Sea (52 spills); the United Kingdom and English Channel (49 spills); Malaysia and Singapore (39 spills); the west coast of France and north and west coasts of Spain (33 spills); and Korea (32 spills).     Also, U.S. Coast Guard analysts have prepared some  graphs and charts  that show the frequencies of oil     spills in different regions of the U.S. and its coastal zone.

Do most oil spills originate from tankers?        A. Information from several sources tells us that the answer to your question is: No, as long as     you consider spills of all sizes. But tanker accidents have accounted for most of the world's largest oil spills.     They are less frequent than other kinds of oil spills, such as pipeline breaks, but typically involve large volumes     of spilled oil relative to other kinds of oil spills.        Here are some sources of information on this topic:        Analysts for the Oil Spill Intelligence Report (available at the  Aspen Publishers website ) track oil spills of at least 10,000 gallons (34 tons). In their annual ""International Oil Spill Statistics"" report for 1999, they reported that in that year--the latest year for which they have analyzed data--about 32 million gallons of oil spilled into the water or onto land, in 257 incidents. Of those incidents, only 11 were spills from tankers, accounting for about 6.6 million gallons, or about one-fifth of the total volume of oil spilled. Twenty-five of the 257 spills were from barges and other kinds of vessels, such as freighters (totaling 1.5 million gallons). Eighteen spills were from trucks or railroad trains (totaling about half a million gallons). The largest number of spills, and the largest volume of oil spilled were from accidents involving pipelines or fixed facilities (131 pipeline spills, totaling about 18.8 million gallons; 66 spills from facilities, totaling about 4.7 million gallons). The percentages of oil spilled from different sources vary greatly from year to year; in some years, tanker accidents represent the largest single source of spilled oil, but only in a very few years is it the case that most of the oil spilled (in significant spills) during that year came from tankers. DeCola (2000) presents a graph showing the volume of oil spilled from various sources, including tankers, from 1978 to 1992.        However, tanker accidents have been the cause of most of the very largest oil spills. The Cutter     Information Corporation analysts also have found that of  the 66     spills  in which at least 10 million gallons (34,000 tonnes) of oil were lost, 48 were from tankers). Eight were     from fixed facilities, especially storage tanks, 5 were from production oil wells, three were from pipelines, and     two were from other kinds of cargo vessels.        Note that the above statistics are only for relatively large oil spills. Researchers from NASA     and the Smithsonian Institution have estimated the amounts of oil that spill from small and large sources. Their  oil pollution graph  shows that     much more oil is estimated to spill into the water from small sources than from major accidents. They also estimate     that  just 5% of the oil that spills     into the ocean  comes from major oil spills. Check the  State of Alaska's list of recent     spills  to see that most accidental oil spills are much smaller than the major incidents that you hear about on     the news.        You can see some more oil spill statistics at the the  International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation website .        Reference:  DeCola, E. 2000. International Oil Spill Statistics: 2000.     Arlington, MA: Cutter Information Corporation.        Q. What was the biggest oil spill in the world? Where and when did it     happen, and what were its consequences?        According to the  Oil Spill Intelligence Report , the biggest so far was the Arabian (Persian) Gulf spill in 1991. You can find very good overviews of the effects of that spill in the August 1991 and February 1992 issues of National Geographic magazine.        Q. When was the first oil spill in the United States?                A. Perhaps no one knows for sure just when the first U.S. spill happened. Here are some suggested       possibilities from our oil spill experts:                    Oil from natural seeps was in the water before the first spills from oil production. In the early 1500s, the Portuguese-born explorer  Juan Cabrillo  [National Park Service website] sailed into what is now Santa Barbara, California, and remarked on the oil he saw bubbling out from a natural seep. He reported that the Chumash Indians scooped and skimmed up the oil, which they used to waterproof their boats.            The first oil well in the U.S. was drilled in 1859 in an area of natural oil seeps along Oil Creek, near Titusville, Pennsylvania. It's possible--although we don't know for sure--that the first oil spills from oil production may have occurred when crude oil was first transported from this well.            The U.S. Fish Commission (NOAA's precursor) steamer  Albatross  reported a         massive oil slick extending from L.A. south to northern San Diego County around 1889 or 1890. We don't know the         source of this slick.            In the late 19-teens, hopane, a chemical ""signal"" of spilled oil, began appearing in the sediments of Puget         Sound, Washington State, indicating that oil had been spilled into the Sound. Hopane's appearance peaked during         WWII and has since been slowly declining.            After passage of federal legislation in 1925, the California Fish and Game Department began a major effort         to reduce spills and leakages from coastal oil drilling operations in California, which then were common. In         1929, for example, a 600-barrel spill covered 9 miles of Ventura County Beach. By 1930, spills from ships were         considered a greater menace than shoreline leakage.                  Our thanks to Gary J. Green for help with this question. If you discover more clues to help answer it, please let our webmaster (  ) know!              Q. I'd like some information about an oil (or chemical) spill that happened     recently in my state (within the U.S.). Where can I go for that information?        A. Check with the Regional Response Team (RRT) for your region. Within each region of the U.S.,     the RRT is responsible for planning and coordinating regional preparedness and responses to oil and hazardous     materials releases. To find the RRT for your region, visit the  NRT website ,     scroll down the page to the ""RRTs"" button, then click that button. You'll find a link to your RRT's website.        Also, your state's environmental agency also may track spills in your state. To find a point of     contact, visit your state's web site (the Library of Congress keeps  a list of all state government websites ), and look for the link     to your state's environmental agency (if you know its name), or for a keyword like ""environment"" (example     environmental agency names are the Washington Department of Ecology and the Oregon Department of Environmental     Quality).        Finally, a source of information about many spills that happened at least a year or so ago is our      Historical Incidents database .

Controlling NOx emissions from large stationary sources, including industry and electric utilities, and mobile sources, is the most effective way of reducing these harmful emissions since NOx is produced primarily from the burning of fuel. Maryland's attainment goal was set at 22 percent reduction by May 2003. As a result, EPA's plan is expected to reduce NOx emissions by 21,000 tons during Maryland's summer ozone season. In the northeast states, the reductions required by EPA's plan are roughly similar, but in some cases slightly more restrictive, than those required under the Ozone Transport Commission regional plan. States must submit their reduction plans to the EPA by September 1999. The submittal must include enforceable regulations to achieve the required reductions in NOx emissions and a plan to allocate NOx emissions to Maryland sources. The Maryland Department of the Environment is working with affected sources and other interested parties to determine how the reductions will be made. Historically, efforts to control the formation of ground-level ozone, Maryland's most pressing air pollutant, were focussed on reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the precursors of ozone. While these VOC emission reductions produced some lowering of ambient ozone levels, it became clear that additional measures were (continued on page 2)  Public Meetings to be Held to Discuss Maryland's Environmental Goals Tentative Meeting Schedule January 25, 1999 Charles County Community College  Center for Business & Industry  Rm.

Regional NOx Plan.... needed, leading to an increased focus on the other ozone precursor--nitrogen oxides. Based on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, reductions of NOx emissions for facilities emitting NOx in Maryland have progressed in three phases The federal Clean Air Act requires that all major NOx sources install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). The first requirement is a sourcespecific requirement to achieve ""reasonable"" reductions. All affected sources in Maryland have submitted and implemented their NOx RACT requirements. RACT achieved a 28,000 ton reduction of NOx during the summer ozone season in Maryland. The Clean Air Act also created the Ozone Transport Commission. This group of states from Northern Virginia to Maine, known as the Ozone Transport Region, has been working together to reduce ground-level ozone in the Northeast. After several years of studying the transport of ozone and its precursors, the Ozone Transport Commission determined that NOx emissions and ozone not only are transported on air currents, but also have a significant effect on ozone in downwind areas when transported. In 1994, the Ozone Transport Commission finalized a Memorandum of Understanding that instituted a regional NOx reduction plan for the region, requiring significant NOx reductions beyond RACT levels from large boilers which are predominantly utilities. The Ozone Transport Commission regional NOx reduction plan contemplated two levels of NOx reductions. The first level is a requirement to achieve a 55 percent or 65 percent reduction in NOx emissions by 1999 depending on a source's location within the region. Ozone Transport Commission states have since acted to implement these reductions by adopting individual state regulations to accomplish the reductions. Maryland's NOx reduction regulation became effective on June 1, 1998 and requires utilities and other major sources to reduce NOx emissions by as much as 65 percent by May 1999. When implemented, Maryland's regulation is expected to achieve a 35,000 ton reduction in NOx emissions during the summer ozone season. Sources can accomplish these reductions by installing controls or purchasing allowances from other sources. The utilities have sued MDE over the regulation, challenging the May 1999 compliance deadline and stating that allowances will not be available to those seeking to purchase them. The second level of NOx reductions under the Ozone Transport Commission's regional NOx reduction plan would come into play if further study and modeling shows a need and would require a 75 percent reduction by 2003. Finally, the EPA and the Environmental Council of the States convened the Ozone Transport Assessment Group to carry out the needed additional study and modeling. Composed of EPA officials, 37 states from the Rocky Mountains eastward, industry and trade association representatives, and health and environmental groups, the Ozone Transport Assessment Group confirmed the importance of ozone transport outside of the Northeast. Modeling from the group also indicated that additional NOx reductions would be needed for ozone attainment. In July 1997, the group issued final recommendations to EPA about controls for both volatile organic compounds and NOx to address long-range transport of ozone and ozone precursors. The recommendations covered a range of sources including utilities, other large and small stationary sources, motor vehicles, diesel engines, fuels and consumer products. This work served as a basis for the new EPA regional NOx reduction plan announced earlier.  Businesses For the Bay the use of solvents as a metal degreaser. Northrop Grumman uses paints with low levels of volatile organic compounds and equipment that allows them to apply less paint to their products without reducing quality. At Northrop Grumman, employees are trained and encouraged to seek out pollution prevention (P2) opportunities. As Steve McKew, manager of Compliance Engineering at Northrop Grumman explains, ""The success of our pollution prevention programs has focused on multi-disciplinary teams that have integrated P2 from our maintenance operations to the design of high-tech electronics. P2 has not only been good for the environment, but also has supported our business plan."" Northrop Grumman has been a member of Businesses for the Bay, a voluntary pollution prevention program, since 1996 and has also volunteered as a Businesses for the Bay mentor to help businesses prevent pollution.

Environmental Indicators Report  by Edwal Stone and Jeffrey Rein The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) recently received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) approval of a comprehensive plan to improve the processing of wastewater discharge permit renewals to strengthen accountability for the impact of all wastewater discharge pollution sources on a receiving stream or river. The plan requires that all wastewater discharge permit renewals within a watershed be considered during the same administrative cycle versus the traditional first-come, first-serve basis. For watershed-based permitting purposes, Maryland has been divided into five geographic areas. To get each permit on cycle for its watershed, any permit with less than half of the effective period remaining when its watershed is being permitted will be processed early for reissuance with all of the other permits in the watershed. Other permits may be allowed to expire and then administratively extended (for no more than two and a half years) to come into cycle  with the other permits in the watershed group. All permittees in the Lower Eastern Shore/Coastal Bays watershed, the first scheduled watershed, are being sent letters this month announcing the new permit renewal schedule. Permittees in the other four major watershed groups will be contacted later this year. MDE expects to have fully implemented these cycles by the end of 1999. Not every application for a permit can be scheduled with its associated watershed. MDE will continue to give priority to new permits and to permit modification requests to meet the startup needs of businesses or to address  significant environmental concerns. The new watershed-based permitting system system uses existing monitoring and sampling data being collected for determination of the Total Maximum Daily Loads required to protect water quality in Maryland's rivers and estuaries. Watershed permitting also will help position Maryland's point source regulatory control program to assist other State agencies in implementing the restoration strategies of the Clinton Administration's Clean Water Action Plan and Maryland's Smart Growth policies.

America Recycles Day a Success Florida Resident Wins American Green Dream House by Virginia Lipscomb And Bonnie Berardelli America Recycles Day, held November 15, was celebrated in Maryland through 41 separate successful public outreach activities. Nationwide, 2.15 million individuals from 38 states and two American territories pledged to improve their personal recycling efforts. The Eastern Shore, and Montgomery and Anne Arundel counties held several household hazardous waste collections. Many counties produced proclamations from their county leaders to encourage citizens to pledge to do more for recycling. Others staffed community events where over 12,000 Marylanders completed the personal pledge card and entered to win the American Green Dream House offered by the America Recycles Day national organizers. The Maryland Recyclers Coalition organized and managed the Maryland Recycling Trail where public and privately owned material recovery facilities, the first stop for most curbside and drop-off recyclables, and recycling centers opened their doors for public tours. The ""trail"" then continued through ten of the more than two hundred businesses and industries that either recycle materials or utilize recycled materials in their products. The American Green Dream House drawing winner was Lori McKee of Boca Raton, Florida, who pledged to buy more products with recycled content. The winner of the Walt Disney World trip for four was Cecil Roberts, a fourth grade student from Tyner, Kentucky.  Santa and some of Charles County's youngest recyclers joined ""Blue Bin Bobbie"" to help promote America Recycles Day during a parade in Charles County.  page 3   MDEnvironment Protecting Water Resources: Part one in a series to help you understand water regulations and programs by Jim George A large number of government and private organizations are working to preserve Maryland's water quality for future generations. With so many environmental partners, the network of ongoing statutory programs, voluntary agreements and interim initiatives is sometimes difficult to sort out. The federal government sets the basic framework for protecting our environment. Federal laws, like the Clean Water Act (CWA), establish a baseline of nationwide protection which establishes a uniform climate for environmental regulation between the individual states. In addition to the major federal laws, state and local governments may adopt laws that provide additional protection. Many of the federal environmental laws are carried out by Maryland State government, using federal and state funds, under delegated federal authority. Maryland's county and city governments have environmental protection functions in departments with titles such as ""public works,"" ""parks,"" or ""licensing."" Similar arrangements of authority delegation exist between Maryland and many local governments. Within this framework, two major federal initiatives shape Maryland's water quality programs. The Clean Water Act, originally adopted in 1972 and administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is the main federal law that addresses environmental aspects of water quality while the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, first signed in 1983 by Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is a voluntary regional compact. Although the roles of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) have changed over the years, DNR currently oversees Maryland's involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, and MDE acts as the primary administrator of the Clean Water Act. Because the Bay Agreement is voluntary, and most provisions of the Clean Water Act are regulatory, these roles are consistent with MDE's responsibility as the state's environmental regulatory agency. Overiew of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement The Chesapeake Bay Agreement has been amended several times since 1983, and is supplemented by numerous action-oriented regional directives. The most prominent initiative, the 40 Percent Nutrient Reduction Goal is being guided through each state's Tributary Strategy. This nutrient goal is linked to the more recent Riparian Forest Buffer Goal, which targets the establishment of 2010 miles of stream buffers by 2010 to help reduce nutrients and improve stream habitat. The Toxics Reduction and Prevention Strategy builds on the 1987 Bay Agreement Amendments. This framework commits the states to a regional focus, conducting assessments, regulatory implementation, and to pollution prevention. The Framework for Habitat Restoration initiative establishes fish passage goals to open 1,357 miles of spawning streams currently blocked by dams, Submerged Aquatic Vegetation goals for reestablishing underwater plants that promote the settling of sediments to improve water clarity and provide hiding places and other habitat, and a commitment to set goals for the reestablishment of oyster reefs. The important role of wetlands were noted in the 1987 Amendments, and a commitment to ""no net loss"" was made in 1989. A wetlands initiative was then crafted to provide guidance to state and local governments. The 1997 Wetlands Protection and Restoration Goals was adopted to establish a  Explore More on Your Own!

Maryland has independently adopted a Wetland Recovery Goal of 60,000 acres. Overview of the Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act is a 1977 amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which set the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States. The law gave the EPA the authority to set standards for the quality of discharge effluents, which required the uniform adoption of certain control technologies for industry. Recognizing that those technologies might be insufficient to protect the water quality in every case, the law gave the EPA the authority to set water quality standards and to tailor or deny discharge permits to ensure that receiving water quality is protected. Many roles, such as setting  standards, permitting, administration, and enforcement are delegated to state governments with EPA oversight. Various amendments to the law coincided with the evolution of managing and funding the control of pollution from point source discharges. However, recognizing that many pollutants are washed from the surface of land into the water, the 1987 amendment introduced provisions in the Clean Water Act guiding states to develop nonpoint source management plans, and makes available grants to implement those plans. Although the Clean Water Act does not give EPA authority to enforce nonpoint source plans, they may withhold grant funding for states that fail to develop and maintain these plans. New Initiatives and Beyond In recent years, the U.S. EPA has embraced a holistic approach to water quality management, applied to various sized watersheds. It is within this context that states are to develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), which specify the upper threshold for substances or stressors that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. Most recently, the EPA and USDA have initiated a Clean Water Action Plan to fulfill the original goal of the Clean Water Act and achieve ""fishable and swimmable"" water for every American. In addition to these initiatives, the Chesapeake Bay Program is undertaking the Chesapeake 2000 initiative to prepare future amendments to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.

Low-Impact Development (LID) can be used by land developers as a less expensive alternative to current practices required under stringent Storm water management regulations imposed by the State and the County. By combining hydro logically functional site design (micro-management techniques) with pollution prevention measures, low-impact development can compensate for development impacts on hydrology and water quality. Its goal is to mimic runoff conditions that existed prior to development by managing runoff in small, cost effective, landscaped features located on building lots instead of being conveyed to a large treatment pond. Additionally, Best Management Practices (BMPs) are integrated into the site design at every juncture. Since LID designs reduce the need for clearing and grading, require less impervious surface, and eliminate pipes, inlet structures and storm water ponds, site development costs can be reduced by as much as 25-30 percent, with corresponding cost savings in long-term infrastructure maintenance costs. The Low-Impact Development approach also has been recognized by the Maryland Department of the Environment as an equivalent alternative to their proposed new design requirements. EPA has given the County a grant to develop a national LID guidance manual, which will be available early next year. EPA is currently investigating the County's LID program as an option for addressing the storm water portion of combined sewer overflows, prevalent in more highly developed, older urban areas.

Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Team Reaches Out to the Public by Christy Mills, DNR ""Good decisions,"" said Ed Ellis, chair of the Worcester County Planning Commission. ""Decisions that promote a balance [economic growth and environmental protection], increasingly require decision makers who are aware of--who understand-- and who continuously educate themselves on increasingly complex issues."" The Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Strategy Team continues to further the publics environmental education so that important environmental decisions came be made by working around the clock to organize two public workshops this past fall to educate the public about what individuals can do to reduce nutrient pollution reaching the Chesapeake Bay. The November symposium entitled How Human-Based Activities Affect the Chesapeake Bay focused on the effect of human-based activities on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and was designed to give landowners information they can use about nutrient management products, practices and techniques to assist in Maryland's goal to reduce nutrients 40 percent by the year 2000. The agenda included work sessions on cover crops, precision farming and best management practices, Landowner Referral Service, homeowner practices with an emphasis on household products, lawn care and septic systems, and a special program for youth. Team Chair, Bill Bostian, greeted participants at the opening session and briefly described the purpose of the Tributary Teams. Mark Powell, editor of the Delmarva Farmer, represented the concerns of the local farmer as he spoke to the group. ""It was gratifying to see the number of individuals with an interest in making a difference who were willing to spend the day at our conference. Our speakers, facilitators and cosponsor, the Lower Eastern Shore Heritage Committee, were simply fantastic to work with,"" said Phil Hager, chair of the steering committee. Over 140 participants attended the sessions offered, including representatives of youth groups and local high schools. ""As a resource manager, I have come to expect hearing `the same old thing' at environmental workshops for the general public. This workshop and regulatory agencies, and other professionals. To facilitate that, the county established a ""working group"" of eighteen individuals who met together to discuss and modify the first draft. ""Estuarine areas are particularly vulnerable to the effects of nutrient and sediment loading, which can be side effects of golf courses,"" said Katherine Munson, natural resources planner and lead organizer of the workshop. ""Golf courses also require significant landscape disruption and groundwater withdrawal. Out of recognition of these potential effects, the county, under a grant from Section 319 and Coastal Zone Management, is developing guidelines for golf course development and management. The Section 319 grant enabled the county and the Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Team to provide an educational forum for the entire community-- not just Worcester County's community, but the entire regional coastal community."" Over 100 people, representing the golf industry, the environmental consulting fields, local, state and federal government and citizens' groups, attended the symposium. The entire event was videotaped for broadcast on the local cable station. The Worcester County Planning Commission will consider public comments on the draft at their meeting in mid-December. They alsoo may request that the guidelines be reviewed again by the working group. The finalized set of voluntary habitat and water quality guidelines that were discussed at the symposium will be printed and distributed to the public. Both workshops were supported through a Non-Point Source Program 319 grant from the EPA. Team members have also been involved with development of a pilot project, the Lower Eastern Shore Conservation and Restoration Action Strategy under the Clean Water Action Plan. Team members have helped focus and encourage local resources and program implementation on high priority areas within the Lower Shore. Involvement has included outreach to watershed and community organizations. Team members also will be addressing opportunities for action plan funding in the future.  Presentations at the November symposium, How Human-Based Activities Affect the Chesapeake Bay, were designed to give land owners practical information to help protect water resources.  offered new and exciting information such as precision farming methods as well as practical down-to-earth tips for homeowners which I had never considered. Even if I was on the steering committee!"" said Joan Kean of Somerset County In December, Team members co-sponsored a symposium entitled Environmental Principles for Golf Course Design and Management to (1) share information and understanding of golf course design, management and environmental protection; (2) promote understanding of primary, local, state and federal environmental regulations that impact golf course development; (3) disseminate information about new and innovative practices in golf course design and management; and (4) identify common ground between the golf industry, government and local citizens through discussion of a set of voluntary habitat and water quality guidelines for golf courses in Worcester County and the Delmarva Peninsula. The model used to develop this document was a slim booklet entitled Environmental Principles for Golf Courses in the United States . These general principles have been endorsed by 22 national and regional organizations representing golf, the environment and government. Like the national model, the local draft was produced with significant input from and discussion among representatives of the golf course industry, resource  page 5"

The practices, which include animal waste management systems and constructed wetlands, were the focus of a project carried out as a joint effort of the University of Wisconsin-Cooperative Extension, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the consolidated Farm Services Agency. The East River watershed is in the Green Bay area of northeastern Wisconsin.   Wetlands may be recipient of milkhouse waste   The impacts of milkhouse waste were monitored at different sites along the river. When the data confirmed the need for a viable and cost-effective disposal system for milkhouse waste, the project managers explored the long-term pollution control capability and survivability of small constructed wetlands for this purpose. They also examined the ability of a constructed wetland to remove nutrients and solids in a cold-weather climate that is subject to heavy and intermittent rain events. Once it was determined that the system would be effective and durable, even in Wisconsin's climate, it was recommended as a best management practice (BMP) for treating milkhouse wastes in the East River watershed.   Pipes and a holding tank   The wetland filter system begins with a pipe leading from the milkhouse to a holding tank with a sump pump. Once the waste reaches the tank it remains there until it has accumulated sufficiently to trigger the float control switch. The waste is then pumped to a diverter tank, which directs the effluent to either a settling/flotation tank, which functions as a pretreatment, or directly to the constructed wetlands.     The constructed wetland is a 12-cell system arranged in four parallel rows with three cells in a series in each row. Six of the cells received untreated wastewater; and six, as noted above, received pretreated wastewater. This design made it possible to test the efficiency of the constructed wetland on treated and untreated wastes. In both cases, prior to reaching these cells, the wastewater flows through the weir slot, where samples can be taken automatically or by grab sampling. After flowing through the weir, the waste flows to the first cell, then the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cells, until it reaches the filter strip and exits the treatment system.    Each cell measures 76 feet by 10 feet. The sides slope to a depth of 18 inches. A layer of sand is placed at the bottom of each cell, then a plastic liner (to prevent any possible groundwater contamination), and a second layer of sand above the plastic liner. Topsoil is laid above the sand and each cell has a berm top. Each one also contains several emergent aquatic plant species.   Results       When the data confirmed the need for a viable and cost-effective disposal system for milkhoue waste, the project managers explored the long-term pollution control capability and survivability of small constructed wetlands.         Based on initial results, the constructed wetland does reduce the flow of nutrients in the wastewater. It is probably more effective in the summer months than in the winter when everything is frozen, but further experience and monitoring are necessary to determine if the nutrients trapped in the system remain there, or if they will be flushed from the wetland during spring thaws.     Two other important lessons have emerged from this project. First, samples taken at the beginning of the experiment, that is, before the wastewater enters the wetlands, show that the pretreated wastewater has less nutrient content than the untreated wastewater. However, there is basically no difference between the pretreated and untreated flows when the wastewater exits the wetlands. In this case, pretreatment is probably not necessary.    Second, the system as a whole appears to be overdesigned for the size of the application. During the summer months not enough wastewater is generated to keep all 12 cells of the wetland functioning. The farm operators and project managers agree that the constructed wetlands should be maintained and reconfigured: the pretreatment structure will be dismantled and the wetland will be reduced in size from 12 to 6 cells.

WAV provides educational materials and know-how for local volunteers who want to take action to improve water quality.         WAV provides educational materials and know-how for local volunteers who want to take action to improve water quality.         WAV groups stencil ""Dump No Waste, Drains to River"" messages on storm drains to remind people that refuse dumped into storm drains does not disappear but ultimately flows to a waterbody. Groups in more than 60 Wisconsin communities have stenciled nearly 10,000 storm-drain inlets this year. The program has cooperated with the Lake Michigan Federation, Chippewa and Waukesha County land conservation departments, the Adopt-A-Lake program, the Audubon Society, and the Wisconsin River Alliance in painting the towns in Wisconsin.     Another WAV project involves working with others to help clean up Wisconsin's rivers and streams. For example, teamed with America Outdoors and the Wisconsin River Alliance, WAV recently drew 580 volunteers to streambanks and lakeshores for a full day's work. The three groups distributed information and trash bags to these volunteers who collected over 37,000 pounds of garbage to clean up 267 miles of shoreline.

Disclaimer: The information in this website is entirely drawn from a 1993 publication, and has not been updated since the original publication date. Users are cautioned that information reported at that time may have become outdated.       The History of the Project            Confrontation led to a City commitment to pursue a biological solution instead of more high-tech treatment units to upgrade the treatment system.     Ducks, geese, elk? These are not usual inhabitants of a wastewater treatment system. But in Cannon Beach, Oregon, particularly in the fifteen acres of the wooded wetlands cells of the system, they are a common sight. How did this come to pass?   Let's look a little closer. The City of Cannon Beach had a problem--how to treat and dispose of its wastewater. With much citizen involvement, a cost-effective ecologically-interactive wastewater treatment facility was created. This Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funded ""Innovative/Alternative"" treatment system uses an existing wooded wetland to provide the final stage of the treatment process.         Effluent structures during winter flooding (when wetlands are typically not operated).     Here's the story. The three-celled sewer lagoon complex in existence at the time of the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972 could not meet the more stringent effluent quality standards set by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). In response to this situation, the City began a Facilities Plan. The completed plan recommended options for system upgrading which met with considerable community opposition.   At this point in 1977, a Sewer Advisory Board was formed. The City of Cannon Beach is a resort community and during the tourist season the population swells from a permanent size of 1,200 to many times that number. Any design considered by the Sewer Advisory Board would have to be able to accommodate these large fluctuations in wastewater flows.         Typical vegetation in the majority of the wetlands (brush, sedges, and ferns).     Confrontation led to a City commitment to pursue a biological solution instead of more high-tech treatment units to upgrade the treatment system. The bureaucratic struggle that ensued lasted eight years and the remarkable result of these meetings was the consolidation of a set of ideas which emerged as yet another facility plan addendum. The issues deliberated included: the use and integrity of the wetlands, elk habitat, chlorination, point of discharge, birdlife, the extent of ecological upset, berming and baffling, fencing costs, and the risks of using new treatment techniques. It is a tribute to the professionals representing the various agencies involved in these meetings that, in spite of diverse and sometimes disparate responsibilities and divergent goals, negotiations took place in a spirit of cooperation and compromise sufficient to allow development of an approvable treatment scheme.   This scheme, the wetlands marsh wastewater treatment system, appeared in draft Facilities Plan Addendum No. 2 in October, 1981 and became final in March, 1982. The Plan subsequently  was adopted by the City Council and approved by all the appropriate agencies through the State Clearinghouse review process. Shortly thereafter, a grant application was completed and submitted to the DEQ and EPA and approval of funding for the project was granted in September, 1982.

The projects, managed by universities and companies in 13 states, will run from one to three years and include research on materials, fuels and chemicals, sensors and controls, and energy conversions. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham said the crosscutting research will advance ""key technology areas, such as solid-state lighting, membranes that produce hydrogen, advanced fuels and chemicals, solid oxide fuel cells, as well as process sensors and controls."" For a list of participating research partners and their projects, see the  DOE press release .    DOE Releases New Test for ""Smart"" Dishwashers   Consumers will get more accurate energy efficiency labeling on new dishwashers, thanks to a new test procedure released by DOE on September 9th. The test, which measures the energy consumption in ""smart"" dishwashers—those with soil sensors—uses three different specified loads of food-soiled dishes to approximate realistic home use. Previous tests used clean dishes that did not trigger the sensors, and therefore did not report dishwasher energy use as accurately as the new test can.   Manufacturers use DOE's test procedures for residential appliances such as dishwashers to calculate the annual energy use and energy cost of every model sold. This energy information provides the core data for the Federal Trade Commission's EnergyGuide labels, which allow consumers to compare the energy efficiency of new appliances. See the  DOE press release .   ""Smart"" dishwashers aren't the only energy-saving innovation available for your kitchen: according to recent tests by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), new magnetic-induction ranges also hold a significant potential for saving energy. The ranges use a high frequency, alternating magnetic field to induce heating in the bottom of iron-based cookware placed on the range. Because energy is transferred directly to the cookware, the ceramic surface of the range stays cool. According to EPRI, the range achieves an efficiency of 92 percent (losing only 8 percent of its energy as waste heat), compared to 72 percent for a standard radiant electric range, 47 percent for a residential gas range, and 30 percent for a commercial gas range. In field tests, commercial kitchens using the range were also cooler, which suggests that they could save on air conditioning costs. See the  EPRI press release .    NIST Awards $24 Million for Fuel Cells, Energy Efficiency, and Solar Power   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, announced 44 new awards through its Advanced Technology Program on September 15th. Among the new awards, eight will go toward advancing fuel cell, solar power, and energy efficiency technologies. Those eight projects comprise a total investment of nearly $51 million, including nearly $24 million in NIST funds.   Four of the projects will focus on fuel cell technologies, including a high-volume manufacturing process for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, a miniature direct-methanol fuel cell, a low-cost process for manufacturing gas diffusion layers, and a variety of approaches to reduce the cost of power from fuel cells. In addition, Astronautics Corporation of America will design, build, and test an energy-efficient refrigerator that uses a magnetic refrigerant; General Electric Company and Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. will advance their roll-to-roll technology for manufacturing solid-state lighting devices; and the Ohio Aerospace Institute will lead a joint venture to develop enhanced thin-film capacitors for use in electric vehicles and in power converters for fuel cells. Finally, AstroPower, Inc. will lead a joint venture to produce low-cost, high-purity silicon for use in the solar power industry. See the  NIST press release .   The award is certainly good news for AstroPower, which continues to struggle financially after its July delisting from the NASDAQ stock exchange. In early August, AstroPower laid off 55 employees, reducing its workforce by about 10 percent. See the  AstroPower press release .    Road Rally to Feature a Wide Range of Vehicle Technologies   The Challenge Bibendum, a three-day road rally sponsored by the Michelin Group, comes to Sonoma, California, on September 23rd, ending in San Francisco on the 25th. Promoted as a ""sustainable mobility event,"" the eclectic road show includes a wide variety of advanced vehicles, each of which is subjected to an emissions test and a variety of performance tests. The event draws its ""Bibendum"" name from the company's symbol, also known as the Michelin Man.   Among the vehicles entered in this year's Challenge Bibendum-the second to be held in the United States-are a number of fuel-cell-powered vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz A Class compact car, a Mercedes-Benz bus, two Ford Focus FCVs, a Toyota FCHV SUV, and a Honda FCX. Ford is also showcasing two vehicles that burn hydrogen in internal combustion engines: a Ford Focus H2ICE and a prototype hybrid-electric Ford Focus wagon. Volvo is concentrating on alternative fuels, with two compressed-natural-gas (CNG) bi-fuel vehicles: an S80 sedan and a V70 wagon. Honda is providing its CNG-fueled Civic GX as well as its two hybrid-electric cars: the Insight and the Civic Hybrid. And Toyota is contributing both its 2003 hybrid-electric Prius and a model sure to draw attention, its new 2004 Prius, which goes on sale in October. See the  Press section  of the  Challenge Bibendum Web site .    Washington and Ohio Pursuing New Wind Power Additions   A utility and a group led by a non-profit organization are planning to bring more wind power to Washington State. On September 9th, Puget Sound Energy, a utility serving 1.4 million customers in the state, issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for 150 megawatts of wind power. The draft RFP is the utility's first step toward achieving its goal of drawing on renewable energy for 10 percent of its power supply by 2013. The company held a public meeting on the draft RFP on September 15th and expects to issue a final RFP in early December; the draft RFP sets January 9th as the due date for proposals. See the Puget Sound Energy  press release  and  RFP .   Meanwhile, the non-profit Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) is leading a group that has secured wind-power development rights on about 20,000 acres of land in Klickitat County, in central Washington near the Oregon border. BEF has joined with the members of the Last Mile Electric Cooperative to secure the rights to the windy site, which could host up to 200 megawatts of wind turbines. The participants hope to obtain permits and build a wind project on the site within the next two years. See the  BEF press release .   While big wind power plans are underway in Washington, a wind project under construction in Ohio is small in comparison but large in significance. The state's first utility-scale wind plant, consisting of two 1.8-megawatt wind turbines, is now being built near Bowling Green, just south of Toledo. The 3.6-megawatt wind facility should be operating by the end of this year. See the  press release  from Green Mountain Energy Company.     Advances in Solar Power Aim for a Touchdown   Solar power technologies advance, in many ways, much like a football team marching down the field: while everyone hopes for that big touchdown pass, most progress is actually achieved gradually, through the combined efforts of many people pushing ahead in every way they can. Three recent news items demonstrate the diversity of approaches that are advancing solar power technologies.   Electrical engineers at Princeton University are trying an end-run around conventional techniques that could yield huge yardage. While most solar cells are built from silicon and other inorganic materials, the Princeton engineers are developing organic solar cells—solar cells built around thin films of organic chemicals. Using a new processing technique, with support in part from DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the engineers boosted the efficiency of two-layer organic solar cells by 50 percent. Although organic solar cells currently convert only about 3 percent of the sunlight that hits them into electricity, the Princeton researchers are confident of combining new materials and processing techniques to achieve at least 5 percent efficiency, and possibly as high as 10 percent. Although that would be low compared to silicon solar cells, the low cost of the organic solar cells could make them cost-competitive. See the  Princeton press release .   Another way to advance solar power is to get more value out of each solar cell, an approach that might be compared to finding a way to make your football passes go farther. A promising technique is to integrate the solar cells into buildings, allowing them to serve a function for the building while also producing power. The latest attempt at such building-integrated solar cells comes from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), which has built solar cells into pyramid-shaped devices incorporated between the panes of a window. The devices help shade the interior from the sun's harshest rays, while allowing soft daylight into the building. At the same time, the solar cells in the devices generate power. RPI is currently testing two working prototypes of the window system. See the  RPI press release .   But real football fans know that a good passing game is best matched by the ability to move the ball on the ground. It's not as glamorous, but the game often hinges on those able to inch the ball ahead with sheer muscle. The solar power equivalent may be the process of growing silicon ingots. Crystalline-silicon solar cells still dominate the solar power market, and arguably the hardest part of making them is the process of growing crystalline silicon ingots, which are then cut up into wafers to create solar cells. Shell Solar has been working with the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance to improve the energy efficiency of its crystal-growing furnaces, with considerable success. According to Shell Solar, the company has cut the power use of its furnaces by 30 percent while reducing the time needed to grow a crystal by up to 40 percent. The company has also increased its crystal yield while greatly lowering its use of argon gas. See the  Shell Solar press release .    Energy Connections    DOE and Energy Companies Pursue Greater U.S. Imports of LNG   Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, has been a subject of increasing attention since July, when Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham proposed holding a Global Liquefied Natural Gas Summit by the end of this year. About the same time, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, noted that increased LNG imports could act as a ""safety valve"" to help the U.S. natural gas markets respond to price spikes caused by imbalances of supply and demand within the United States. DOE reiterated that message on September 10th, when it enlisted the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) to help educate energy decision-makers about LNG. See the  DOE press release .   Meanwhile, the U.S. energy industry has been actively pursuing LNG imports. The Cove Point facility in southern Maryland, owned by Dominion, has been reactivated after a 23-year shutdown and received its first shipment in late August. On September 10th, Sempra Energy received approval to build a new LNG receiving terminal near Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company plans to begin construction next year, more than 20 years after the last LNG terminal was built in the United States. The terminal should begin operating in 2007. And Tracebel Electricity and Gas International, which currently supplies about half of U.S. LNG imports, has expanded its LNG terminal in Everett, Massachusetts, and has added two more vessels to its shipping fleet. The company's LNG shipments for the first half of 2003 increased 65 percent compared to the first half of 2002. See the press releases from  Dominion ,  Sempra Energy , and  Tracebel .   Both Sempra Energy and Shell received approvals in August to build LNG terminals in Baja California, Mexico. Shell will import the LNG from an offshore LNG export terminal near Western Australia. The company intends to build a new pipeline from the project to the existing natural gas infrastructure, allowing the new terminal to serve natural gas needs in western Mexico and southern California. ChevronTexaco has similar plans, using an offshore terminal near Baja California, and is also seeking permits for an offshore LNG terminal near the Louisiana coast. And Contango Oil & Gas Company is planning an LNG terminal on Quintana Island, located near Freeport, Texas.

New York City uses alternative fuels in a number of buses, garbage trucks, and light-duty vehicles, and 200 natural-gas taxis operate in the city. DOE coordinates the Clean Cities Program, a locally based voluntary partnership of government and industry. Program partners help deploy alternative fuel vehicles and build supporting alternative fuel infrastructure. See the  DOE press release  and the  Clean Cities Program Web site .   Although the official Earth Day 2003 theme, ""Water for Life,"" seems far afield from energy issues, water conservation also helps to save energy. Energy is used to pump, purify, and heat water, so any action to save water (especially hot water) will also save energy. To learn more about the Water for Life campaign and its connection to energy efficiency, see the  Earth Day Network Web site  and the related  press release  from the Alliance to Save Energy.    Energy Star Awards Honor Energy Efficiency Leaders   DOE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presented the 2003 Energy Star Partner of the Year awards on April 15th. The awards highlight the efforts of leading manufacturers, retailers, utility companies, and a variety of state and regional programs that promote energy efficiency and awareness of the Energy Star label.   Leading product manufacturers won Partner of the Year awards in three categories: lighting, appliances, and windows. For lighting, Sylvania won for its large product line of Energy Star-qualified lighting, which experienced an 85 percent growth in sales in 2002. For appliances, Maytag Corporation won for its large and diverse product line of Energy Star-qualified appliances. In 2002, the company introduced new models of Energy Star-qualified appliances in every product category, including a new line of dishwashers. For windows, JELD-WEN Inc. won for its aggressive promotion of the Energy Star label. Eighty percent of the company's windows and doors carry the Energy Star label. See the  DOE press release .   In addition to these top awards, DOE and EPA awarded Partner of the Year awards to 36 other organizations that have been instrumental in promoting energy efficiency and the Energy Star label. See the  EPA press release . The full list is posted on the Energy Star Web site ( PDF 30 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .   Energy Star was created in 1992 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promote energy-efficient computers. DOE formed a partnership with EPA in 1996 to expand the scope of the Energy Star labeling program to include highly efficient appliances, residential windows, doors and skylights, compact fluorescent bulbs and fixtures, consumer electronics, heating and air conditioning systems, homes, and more. Today, more than 7,000 organizations have become Energy Star partners and are committed to improving the energy efficiency of products, homes and businesses. See the  Energy Star Web site .    Toyota Unveils Improved Prius as Ford Previews Hybrid Escape   Toyota introduced a new, larger, more powerful Prius on April 16th at the 2003 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS). The 2004 Prius is about 15 percent more fuel efficient than the current model; according to Toyota, the new model will achieve a combined city/highway fuel efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. At the same time, a new lift-back rear end (somewhat reminiscent of the Honda Insight) and a longer wheelbase moves the Prius up to the midsize category of vehicles. The new Prius also accelerates faster than the current model and meets the California Air Resources Board (CARB) certifications as a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) and a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV).   One key to the performance of the Prius is its new Hybrid Synergy Drive, which feeds the battery power through a new high-voltage power converter, supplying 500 volts of electricity to a 50-kilowatt motor. The new high-voltage motor is about 50 percent more powerful than the motor in the current model, and allows the vehicle to operate in all-electric mode for a greater percentage of time. The new Prius is expected to go on sale in fall. See the  Toyota press release  and  Web site .   Also debuting at the NYIAS was the new Escape Hybrid SUV (sport utility vehicle) from Ford Motor Company. Like the Prius, the Escape Hybrid is a ""full hybrid""-able to run on electric power only-and will achieve about 35 to 40 miles per gallon. It will also meet the SULEV and PZEV standards. Ford will begin low-volume fleet production of the Escape Hybrid by year-end, and plans to begin retail sales in late 2004. In addition, Ford announced plans to launch a new midsize sedan, the Futura, in late 2005, and plans to eventually offer a hybrid-electric version of that vehicle as well. See the Ford press releases for the  Escape Hybrid  and the  Futura .   While luxury vehicles, sports cars, and SUVs continue to dominate most auto shows, advanced-technology vehicles are a growing presence. At this year's NYIAS, which runs through April 27th, automakers are displaying four gasoline-electric hybrids, three fuel-cell vehicles, and one hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion vehicle-enough to earn a separate category on the NYIAS Web site. See the ""Alternative Fuel"" category in the NYIAS "" New Vehicle Gallery .""    Tucson Celebrates Earth Day by Opening a Zero-Energy Home   A new home in Tucson, Arizona, that produces as much energy and it uses was introduced to the public on Earth Day, April 22nd. Designed by architect Devereaux and Associates and built by John Wesley Miller Companies, the so-called ""Zero-Energy Home"" combines energy efficiency with solar energy technologies that will meet all its energy needs over the course of a year. The uses of solar energy include solid masonry construction for thermal mass, a 4-kilowatt solar power system, and an integrated solar hot water and space heating system, which uses tankless water heaters as a backup energy source. But the home is by no means Spartan: it also includes a high-efficiency central air conditioning system. According to the NAHB Research Center, the energy performance of the building will be monitored of one year. DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory provided partial funding for the project. See the NAHB Research Center's "" Virtual Press Kit .""   DOE is supporting the construction of a number of zero-energy buildings throughout the country. In late March, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the use of a DOE grant to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority for the design and construction of six zero-energy homes in Atlantic City. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) awarded a grant of $75,613 for the project. See the  NJBPU press release .    Penn Doubles Its Wind Power Purchase to 10 Percent   The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) announced on April 21st that it has doubled its purchase of wind-generated power. Penn will now buy 40 million kilowatt-hours of wind power annually from Community Energy Inc.—the largest retail purchase of green power in the nation. The university's new 10-year commitment will lead to the construction of a new wind power facility in Pennsylvania. See the  Penn press release .   Green power sales are also supporting wind power in New York State, where Green Mountain Energy Company (GMEC) has bought all the environmental attributes associated with wind power production from the Madison Windpower facility near Hamilton. The wind power credits will be used to meet the demand for people buying green power through the Niagara Mohawk Renewable Energy Program. See the  GMEC press release .   The credits purchased by GMEC are often referred to as ""green tags""—also known as ""tradable renewable credits""—and are a growing market for renewable energy. As one sign of that growth, the Center for Resource Solutions announced in early April that its Green-e Program has certified the first-ever wholesale broker for green tags. Evolution Markets LLC hopes to make green power transactions easier by helping to build a wholesale market for green tags. See the  Green-e press release .    GE Hydro to Upgrade U.S. Hydropower Plants   Many hydroelectric power plants across the United States are aging and in need of refurbishment, and a growing number of hydropower plant owners are choosing to boost their facilities' power production while updating their equipment. This trend is evident at GE Hydro, a unit of GE Power Systems, which recently announced several hydropower turbine refurbishment contracts. On March 10th, GE Hydro won a $47 million contract to refurbish seven turbines at the John H. Kerr Powerhouse in Boydton, Virginia. The project will increase power production by more than 70 megawatts, or roughly 34 percent. On March 24th, the company won a $7 million contract to upgrade two generators at the Jaybird Hydroelectric Powerhouse in northern California. That project will increase power production from 154 megawatts to 170 megawatts, a 10 percent increase. And on April 7th, GE Hydro entered into an agreement with southern California's Imperial Irrigation District (IID) to evaluate and upgrade that utility's hydropower facilities. The IID generates 84 megawatts of power from 14 hydropower units at seven sites along the All American Canal, which runs from Yuma, Arizona, to California's Imperial Valley. See the GE press releases from March 10th ( PDF 105 KB ), March 24th ( PDF 72 KB ), and April 7th ( PDF 86 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .   Meanwhile, concerns about this summer's hydropower production in the Pacific Northwest are gradually easing, as above-average precipitation is bringing snowpack levels and predicted streamflow volumes closer to normal. As noted in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) ""Power Update"" for April 18th, snowpack above the Dalles Dam is now at 86 percent of normal, and predicted streamflow volumes through July are at 79 percent of normal. In March, the watershed above the Dallas Dam received 75 percent more precipitation than normal. See the BPA report ( PDF 13 KB ).    Site News    PA Windmap   The PA Windmap Web site provides a complete guide to wind energy resources in Pennsylvania. It features an interactive map program that visitors can use to create printable wind maps. PA Windmap is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation Consultants, Inc, a regional nonprofit organization based in Pittsburgh.    Energy Connections    EIA Expects Lower Gasoline Prices this Summer   U.S. motorists will pay less at the pump this summer than they have in recent months, according to a report issued in early April by DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA anticipates an average price of $1.56 per gallon for regular gasoline, down from peak prices of more than $1.70 per gallon earlier this year. However, the projected prices remain about 17 cents per gallon higher than last summer's average price. See the  EIA press release .   Indeed, the latest figures from EIA, released on April 21st, confirm that gasoline prices are dropping. On average, U.S. gasoline prices dropped 2.1 cents per gallon in the past week, reaching an average of $1.57 per gallon. See the  EIA Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update .

October 23, 2002      News and Events       New Large Wind Plants Slated for New Mexico, California, Iowa, and Colorado    Facing Increasing Interest in Wind Power, BLM Announces New Policy    DOE National Laboratories Garner 24 ""R&D 100"" Awards    DOE Secretary Abraham Hosts ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota    Sodium Sulfur and Lithium-Metal-Polymer Batteries Show Commercial Promise    Solar-Powered Aircraft Successfully Surveys Coffee Fields           Site News            Renewable Energy Atlas of the West      Energy Connections       Arrest Proves Energy Trading Role in California Power Crisis              News and Events    New Large Wind Plants Slated for New Mexico, California, Iowa, and Colorado   New Mexico will gain its first large wind power plant late in 2003, announced Public Service of New Mexico (PNM) on October 21st. The 204-megawatt New Mexico Wind Energy Center will be built, owned, and operated by FPL Energy, LLC, a leading wind plant developer. The project will feature 135 1.5-megawatt wind turbines and will span the borders of Quay and De Baca counties, about 50 miles west from the center of the state's eastern border. PNM intends to sell some of the wind power to its customers through a green power program, selling any excess wind power on the wholesale power market. Construction will begin this year on the facility, which will generate enough electricity to supply 94,000 homes in the state. See the  PNM press release .    In addition to the New Mexico Wind Energy Center, FPL Energy has several projects in the works, including large wind facilities in northern California and Iowa. In California, the High Winds Energy Center, a 150-megawatt wind plant, is expected to begin commercial operation in mid-2003, providing electricity to PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc. In Iowa, the 98-megawatt Hancock County Wind Energy Center will begin operation this year; Interstate Power and Light Company and several local electric cooperatives and municipal utilities will buy the wind power. Hancock County is located in the north-central part of Iowa, just west of Mason City. The area is already populated by small wind projects in Algona and Forest City, and a 42-megawatt wind project near Clear Lake. See the  Iowa Wind Energy Project  page on the American Wind Energy Association Web site.    FPL Energy will also add 37 megawatts to its Stateline Clean Energy Center, located on the Washington-Oregon border, increasing the total capacity of that wind facility to 300 megawatts. That project will be complete by year-end. For information on all the company's current projects, see the  FPL Energy press release .    Colorado will join the greater-than-100-megawatts wind club next year, thanks to an order issued in early October by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Under the order, Xcel Energy will contract with GE Wind Energy, LLC to build a 162-megawatt wind facility near Lamar in southeastern Colorado. The Colorado PUC originally ordered Xcel Energy to pursue a wind facility in February 2001, but the project was jeopardized when Enron Wind Corporation's parent company, Enron Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. A new contract was negotiated successfully after GE Power Systems purchased Enron Wind and committed to move forward with the project. Several parties, including the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, participated in the contract settlement. See the Land and Water Fund press release ( PDF 195 KB ) and the Colorado PUC order ( PDF 222 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .    Meanwhile, on the East Coast, a scientific data tower is now being installed on Horseshoe Shoal, located off the coast of Massachusetts in Nantucket Sound. The structure will provide essential data for a proposed 420-megawatt offshore wind plant proposed by Cape Wind Associates, LLC. On October 8th, the data tower installation overcame a legal challenge that sought to halt the project. See the  Cape Wind press releases .    Facing Increasing Interest in Wind Power, BLM Announces New Policy   With companies showing a growing interest in developing new wind energy projects in the West, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced a new wind energy policy on October 17th. The new policy provides guidance on the timely processing of wind energy right-of-way applications and addresses BLM requirements for land use planning, environmental reviews, and authorization of wind energy projects, as well as land rental fees for such projects.    The BLM, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, currently administers 25 wind energy right-of-way authorizations on public lands in California and Wyoming. The sites cover roughly 5,000 acres of land and produce about 500 megawatts of wind power. However, the BLM has recently received about 30 new applications for wind energy projects in Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, California, Wyoming and Washington. See the  BLM press release , which links to the full policy.     DOE National Laboratories Garner 24 ""R&D 100"" Awards   DOE national laboratories contributed to 24 of the year's top 100 practical applications of science, according to R&D Magazine, which presented its 40th annual ""R&D 100"" awards on October 16th. The awards encompass all industries and are conferred only upon leading-edge products of technical significance that are currently available to license or purchase. Of the nine DOE national laboratories that earned awards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory garnered the most accolades, having contributed to six of the winning entries. Descriptions of all 100 awardees were published in the  September edition  of R&D Magazine.    A number of this year's R&D 100 awards relate to energy efficiency and renewable energy, including a translucent solar module developed by BP Solar and DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); a hybrid electric engine developed by Toyota Motor Corporation; a supercapacitor with the energy density of a battery, developed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc.; a technology for removing carbon dioxide from landfill gas, developed by Acrion Technologies, Inc.; a soybean-based plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride plastics, developed by Battelle and the Ohio Soybean Council; and a corrosion-resistant coating for carbon steel tubing in geothermal power plants, developed by NREL, DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory, Bob Curran & Sons Corporation, and Ticona Corporation. Of particular interest is a high-throughput production process for solar cells, developed by AstroPower, Inc. The company produces its APx-8 solar cells using a lower-quality silicon at a production rate of 3.1 meters per minute. According to the award, the next best competitor's production rate is only 0.02 meters per minute. See the R&D Magazine link above, the  AstroPower press release , and for further information on the two relevant NREL awards, see the  NREL press release .    As R&D Magazine celebrates the 40th anniversary of its R&D 100 awards, DOE is celebrating its 25th anniversary this month. See the  DOE press release .    October is also Energy Awareness Month, and DOE has named this year's theme ""A Secure Energy Future: Conserve Energy to Ensure Affordable, Reliable Power Supplies."" See the  announcement  from DOE's Federal Energy Management Program.    DOE Secretary Abraham Hosts ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota   Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham hosted a ""Renewable Energy Roundtable"" in South Dakota on October 18th. The forum addressed the Bush administration's energy policy and the latest developments in renewable power production and biofuels. It featured local representatives from the biofuels industry, the South Dakota Corn Growers Association, the South Dakota Rural Electrical Association, wind energy companies, and renewable energy advocates.    ""President Bush and I are convinced that renewable energies must play a large role in meeting our challenging future energy needs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil,"" Secretary Abraham said. ""For every improvement in renewable energy technology we develop, for every new megawatt of electricity or gallon of alternative fuel that is produced, we make our nation a little more secure.""   Secretary Abraham highlighted the recent award of $5.4 million to Broin and Associates Inc. of Sioux Falls to develop a ""Second Generation"" dry mill biorefinery pilot project. The $11.3-million pilot project is a joint effort of DOE and Broin and will be located at Broin's biorefinery in Scotland, South Dakota. See the  DOE press release .     Sodium Sulfur and Lithium-Metal-Polymer Batteries Show Commercial Promise   Two advanced battery technologies-sodium sulfur and lithium-metal-polymer (LMP) batteries-have been in the news recently, indicating that these technologies are making strides commercially.    American Electric Power (AEP) dedicated a sodium sulfur battery system at its suburban office park near Columbus, Ohio, in late September. Sodium sulfur batteries have the advantage of providing very high power outputs for short durations. For instance, the AEP battery system is rated to provide 100 kilowatts of power for about seven hours, but up to 500 kilowatts of power for short durations. AEP claims the system to be the first of its kind in the United States. DOE's Sandia National Laboratories was one of many partners in the project, which will be used to reduce peak power loads and guarantee high-quality power at the office park. See the  AEP press release .    For LMP batteries, a Canadian company called AVESTOR is taking the lead: the company announced in mid-September that it was starting production of the world's first commercial LMP battery at its new plant in Boucherville, Quebec. According to the company, LMP batteries are one-third the size and one-fifth the weight of traditional valve-regulated lead-acid batteries. Although the company's initial product is designed to provide power backup for telecommunications relays, the batteries could also be used in hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles, as well as in utility applications similar to the AEP installation. See the  AVESTOR press release .    But don't write off lead-acid batteries just yet: GNB Industrial Power, part of Exide Technologies, announced on October 11th that it will collaborate with DOE's Sandia National Laboratories to analyze the performance of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries in large battery energy storage systems. The company claims that lead-acid batteries are still the preferred technology for such energy storage systems. See the  Exide Technologies press release .    Solar-Powered Aircraft Successfully Surveys Coffee Fields   For most people, the only connections between the sun and coffee are that the former helps the latter grow, and they are both welcome sights in the morning. But thanks to scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the sun may now have a role in determining when coffee growers should harvest their fields.    In a test of remote sensing from uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), NASA's solar-powered and remote-controlled Pathfinder Plus airplane hovered for four hours over the island of Kauai on September 30th, relaying 300 high-resolution images of the island's largest coffee plantation to the ground. Despite clouds covering as much as 80 percent of the plantation, the airplane was able to fly over clearings in the clouds and photograph virtually all of the coffee fields. At one point, the aircraft was even controlled by a researcher in California. The photos were provided to the plantation's harvest manager, who can judge the ripeness of the coffee beans in each field by the color. Unfortunately, bad weather limited the test to only a single flight. See the  press release  from the NASA Ames Research Center.    Stan Herwitz, a professor of earth science at Clark University, is the principal investigator for the project. Images of the airplane and the coffee fields, as well as a mission log and other information, are available on his  Clark University Web site .    Future UAVs may be powered by fuel cells, thanks to the Boeing Company. Boeing announced in early September that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had awarded the company a contract to develop a fuel-cell-based propulsion system for UAVs that will allow them to fly for extended periods of time. See the  Boeing press release .     Site News    Renewable Energy Atlas of the West   This online Atlas profiles wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass power resources in the West using high-resolution maps. An interactive map tool allows you to control your view and printing of the maps.  The Atlas was designed as a resource for policy makers, advocates, landowners, and developers interested in producing electricity from renewable energy. The Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, Northwest Sustainable Energy for Economic Development, Green Info Network, and Integral GIS created the Web site. Sponsors include the Hewlett Foundation and The Energy Foundation.     Energy Connections    Arrest Proves Energy Trading Role in California Power Crisis   Back in 2000 and 2001, when California was facing skyrocketing electricity costs, near-bankrupt utilities, and rolling blackouts, energy analysts struggled to explain the reasons for the crisis. Although many factors contributed to the problems, some analysts pointed to the energy companies themselves, claiming that they used their market power to push electricity prices higher. That viewpoint, which was greeted with some skepticism at the time, was confirmed last week when the former Chief Energy Trader for Enron Corporation agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Timothy N. Belden, who worked in Enron's West Power Trading Division in Portland, Oregon, will admit that Enron's manipulation of California's energy markets was illegal, and has agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation into the manipulation of California energy markets.    In announcing the guilty plea, U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan said, ""These charges answer the question that has long troubled California consumers: whether the energy crisis was spurred in part by criminal activity. The answer is a resounding yes. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice those who served their own selfish purposes by intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers in California and on the West Coast."" See the  press release  from the U.S. Department of Justice.    Another contributor to the crisis was the price and availability of natural gas, which fuels a large percentage of California's power plants. A report prepared in August by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) found ""preliminary indications"" that natural gas prices were manipulated as well. FERC's investigations are continuing. See the  FERC Web site .

Constructed wetlands have long been recognized for their cleansing      abilities and they provide an environmentally friendly and energy efficient      method of treating wastewater. The pilot wetland will test the effectiveness      of wetlands as tertiary treatment, and offer a wildlife habitat and      educational opportunity to the public.         The project was designed and implemented in conjunction with DNR wildlife      biologists based on a plan initiated and approved by them.         ""More than 90 percent of Colorado's native species occupy wetlands for at      least a portion of their lives,"" said Greg Walcher, executive director of      the DNR. ""Efforts by Coors to improve wetlands and our basic understanding      of these critical habitats will not only benefit wildlife, but also provide      another window into what we love most about Colorado for our citizens and      for visitors.""        The design incorporates energy savings and efficiency, water treatment      test cells, wildlife habitat and a public viewing area. Continuous      monitoring of key water quality indicators will evaluate the wetland      performance for removal of nutrients, sediment, and other parameters.         OEMC completed an inventory of all functional constructed treatment      wetlands in Colorado. The project team recorded effective practices and      features, as well as lessons learned from the first generation of      treatment wetlands. From this project, OEMCs goal was to build a wetland      that incorporated the identified best practices. Coors was identified as a      partner because of its commitment to water quality, location and resources      to construct and maintain the wetland, said Rick Grice, executive director      of OEMC. We are thrilled that this demonstration provides such benefits to      the community, environment and wildlife.        Construction of the wetland began in June 2003, and was completed in late      August. The wetland is open to public viewing from the public bike path. The      public viewing area includes informational displays explaining the purpose      of wetlands, including benefits to the public, wildlife, and water quality.         We are fortunate to have committed groups like OEMC and DNR on this      project, said Catherine Adams, vice president and Chief Environmental      Officer for Coors. Hopefully, what we all learn through this project will      lead to improvements in water quality for Colorado.         Coors will submit a comprehensive technical analysis of the wetland in a      report to OEMC and DNR at the conclusion of the study in 2005. The report      will include achieved results, successes and lessons learned, as well as a      copy of the engineering plans and design, photos, wetland performance and      conclusions. The report will be made available to the public by OEMC.

COORS CONSTRUCTED TEST WETLAND      FACT SHEET        What is a constructed wetland?       Wetlands are natural water purification systems. The cleansing      properties identified in natural wetlands can be mimicked in constructed      treatment wetlands. Constructed treatment wetlands are designed to maximize      the natural abilities of wetlands to remove or reduce pollutants from a      variety of wastewater sources.             Size       Two acres  wetted area is 1.7 acres      250,000 gallons per day             Test duration       Two years             Location/Accessibility       The test wetland is located one-quarter mile east of McIntyre Street and      just north of Clear Creek on Coors property in Golden. A public viewing area      that overlooks the wetland is located on the Jefferson County Open Space      bike trail that runs parallel to Highway 58 in Golden.             What is the purpose of the constructed wetland at Coors?       The overall goal of the test wetland will be to investigate wetland      treatment processes and develop design criteria for future treatment      consideration. The wetland will test natural treatment processes for brewery      and domestic wastewater effluent and provide habitat for wildlife.      As water quality standards are adjusted over the next ten years to drive      improvement of water quality, wastewater discharges around the state will      benefit from alternative, cost effective methods for removal of pollutants.                  How does the wetland work?       Wastewater that has been analyzed to ensure it meets discharge permit      limits will flow into two test cells, traveling through marsh, pond and more      marsh in each cell. The flow to the two test cells will be varied to study      treatment times. The vegetation used in the two cells will also be varied to      see what combinations best remove pollutants. The water then flows through a      natural wildlife habitat and back into Clear Creek. The wetland will provide      a natural substitute for tertiary treatment (third-stage treatment) of      wastewater.              What specifically will be studied at the wetland?                Primary criteria that will be investigated include:           nitrogen and phosphorus removal           BOD5 removal           need for plant harvesting           suspended solids removal                         The variables that will be studied include:           type of plants           hydraulic & organic loading rates           subsurface flow operation           anoxic/aerobic zone optimization           impact of temperature           solids accumulation                          ###                   225 East 16th Avenue, Suite 650, Denver, CO     80203    Phone 303-894-2383        Hotline 1-800-632-6662    Fax 303-894-2388                                                                                                                      Rick Grice, Executive Director  Governor's Office of Energy Management and Conservation  225 E. 16th Avenue, Suite 650, Denver, CO 80203        303-894-2383 •  800-632-662 •  TDD: 800-659-2656  •  Fax: 303-894-2388  Send comments, suggestions or questions to:  oemc@state.co.us                               Programs     Residential  |  Commercial & Institutional  |  Agricultural & Rural Prosperity  |  Distributed Generation   Transportation & Alternative Fuels  |  Renewable Energy  |  Waste Management & Recycling   Calendar of Events  |   Press Releases  |   Presentations  |   Publications  |   Media Coverage  |   Links  |   Grants  |  Home   What's New  |   How It Works  |   Success Stories"
GX263-06-3569190	"Earth Celebrate 22 April  Day  Maryland Department of the Environment  MDEnvironment April 1998  Whats Inside... Smart Growth Update....................................2 Wetland Restoration Committee Appointed............3  Maryland To Restore Wetlands by Tony Abar When the first Europeans settled Maryland, the landscape was covered with approximately twice the wetland area that exists today. In fact, some estimates place our wetland losses at more than 70 percent of the original wetland acreage. Throughout Maryland's history, wetlands have been drained and filled to satisfy society's need to expand. Since the 1940s, explosive growth and intensive land use has reduced Maryland's wetlands by approximately 60,000 acres. Today, the value of Maryland's wetlands and the important functions that they serve are generally recognized and appreciated. Wetlands protect water quality, reduce flooding, provide critical habitat for many fish and wildlife species and add diversity and aesthetics to the environment. Yet, as with most valuable natural resources, federal, state and local regulations are still needed to protect and preserve these resources. Under the current Maryland wetland regulations, which has a ""no net loss"" goal, wetland losses are to be avoided wherever possible and unavoidable losses are to be offset through the creation of wetlands to compensate for permitted losses. In May 1997, Governor Glendening established a new goal for the state's wetlands program when he announced an initiative to restore 60,000 acres of tidal and nontidal wetlands. With his announcement, the Governor moved the state's wetlands management goal from ""no net loss"" to one of ""net gain.""

The new vehicles emit nearly 70 percent less hydrocarbons and 50 percent less nitrogen oxides, the principal air pollutants that form ozone, than vehicles now in showrooms. The agreement also will reduce air emissions from most sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks. The added cost will be less than $100 per vehicle. Because the federal Clean Air Act prevents EPA from tightening emission standards from vehicles until 2004, the voluntary agreement will help achieve cleaner air in Maryland and around the country at least five years ahead of schedule. Maryland and other Northeast states have been working hard for years to get the manufacturers to produce cleaner vehicles to reduce the ground-level ozone problems that we experience every summer. With this agreement, the cleaner cars will start to be sold in Maryland and other Northeast states in 1999 and nationwide by 2001. Ground-level ozone, a component of smog, causes coughing and throat irritation, lowers resistance to disease and intensifies heart and lung disease. Especially sensitive are children, the elderly and the more than 600,000 Marylanders that suffer from respiratory problems. It is estimated that air pollution causes 1/4 of the Chesapeake Bay's pollution problems.

In just the past six weeks, the program has been formally recognized by the World Wildlife Fund and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It also has been praised in articles about the high costs of suburban sprawl that have appeared in the Detroit Free Press and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. On January 30, World Wildlife Fund formally recognized the Smart Growth initiative as a ""Gift to the Earth"" as part of the international organization's ""Living Planet Campaign."" In quarterpage advertisements that appeared in both the New York Times and the Washington Post, World Wildlife Fund praised the Smart Growth initiative, the new Rural Legacy Program, and the $200 million Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a federal-state partnership program designed to reduce nutrient pollution and conserve farmland in Maryland over the next 15 years. ""Under the leadership of Governor Parris Glendening, Maryland has initiated strong action to protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed from the threats of suburban sprawl and agricultural runoff,"" World Wildlife Fund states in its advertisements, which were part of a campaign designed to highlight the struggle to protect the world's most outstanding wildlife and wild places as we enter a new century. On February 27, Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, came to Annapolis to present Governor Glendening with the National Trust's President's Award ""for his model leadership in preserving the economic vitality of the state's older cities and towns against the ravages of wasteful, sprawling development."" Moe said that, ""Under Governor Glendening's leadership, Maryland is blazing new trails by enacting community friendly policies ... [that] bring new vitality to existing communities and curb the loss of pristine open space."" In a February 22 article in the Detroit Free Press, Keith Schneider, executive director of the Michigan Land Use Institute, called Maryland's Smart Growth initiative ""the most promising new tool for managing growth in a generation."" ""It's no longer good enough for Michigan lawmakers to say they don't know how to respond,"" Schneider wrote. ""Maryland has shown the way."" In a front-page series that prodded local officials to do more to combat sprawl, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch used sidebar stories about efforts in Maryland and Portland, Oregon, as examples of reforms the Midwestern states could copy. ""Maryland's Smart Growth law didn't go as far as Glendening had hoped. But it went much further than most states, including Missouri and Illinois,"" the Post-Dispatch wrote. ""Maryland's experience provides a textbook case of how advocates of growth management can prevail over arguments for unfettered development."" with best management practices implemented to achieve a reduction in environmental impacts over more typical development practices (e.g. elimination of ""curb and gutter"" in favor of stormwater drainage systems that take advantage of natural swales in the landscape). But many local rules that govern development have been in place for years, if not decades. These rules, which may have made sense at one time, are now being collectively challenged by those who believe there should be more flexible ways to regulate development. During the workshop, successful Maryland case studies were presented along with examples of the extensive nature of the local review process. Participants even got to try their hand at designing a new community that had to include innovative site design, address environmental concerns, and still maintain marketing objectives. The Patapsco/ Back River Tributary Team hosts were encouraged to find ways to foster wider discussions on these and related smart growth issues of importance throughout Maryland.  Incorporating the Warfield Complex into the Town of Sykesville Sykesville, a town of approximately 3,200 in the southeast corner of Carroll County, will host a planning charrette during the third week in April with a goal to reunite the formerly state-owned Warfield Property with the historic residential and commercial village core through a new comprehensive Master Plan. The Warfield Complex contains approximately 130 acres and more than a dozen historic buildings designed in the 1890s. The creative challenge arises from seeking not only the best possible use of the property, but in unifying the complex to the existing town center. A consultant team of design professionals will facilitate the charrette, which will result in an updated Master Plan for both the town and the redeveloped Warfield site. This project has the potential to serve as a model for the implementation of the Smart Growth Initiative. Charrette criteria will be focussing on meeting Smart Growth goals while solving sitespecific challenges Sykesville and its consultant team is inviting interested design, planning, preservation, development, or related professionals to bring their energy and ideas and participate in the charrette.

Glendening has appointed a 26-member committee of business, agricultural, environmental and government leaders to guide the state's efforts to restore approximately 60,000 acres of Maryland's lost wetlands. By identifying areas suitable for wetland creation or restoration projects, working with landowners on innovative funding options and launching an all-out effort to educate the public this diverse group will help preserve and restore these important natural resources. The committee also will assist state government in the development of a wetlands conservation plan, identify priority protection and restoration areas, provide guidance and technical support for wetlands projects and recommend incentives for wetland creation. ""I am confident that the collective expertise of this steering committee will help us to restore our precious wetlands so that we can once again reap the benefits of these important environmental resources,"" Governor Glendening said.

Maryland's Wetland Restoration This past fall, the Chesapeake Executive Council, which is made up of the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, the mayor of the District of Columbia, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, followed Maryland's lead and agreed to set a ""net gain"" goal for wetlands throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Although a large part of Maryland is within the Chesapeake Bay drainage area, the state's wetlands restoration initiative will not be limited to the Bay watershed. Rather, restoration efforts will be statewide, including the Maryland coastal bays watershed, has experienced significant wetland losses. State agencies will maximize support for the wetlands restoration initiative by surveying state properties for opportunities to create wetlands; and wherever appropriate sites are identified, wetlands creation projects will be incorporated in construction plans. Federal and local government agencies will be encouraged to undertake similar efforts. Much of the success of the wetlands restoration initiative will depend on the willingness of landowners, including businesses, conservancies, and individuals, to participate in the effort. If the goal is to be reached, many of the wetlands to be created must be located on private land. Several state and federal agencies administer programs that provide assistance to landowners for wetlands restoration. These programs vary in their provisions as to eligible lands and landowners, type and level of available assistance (technical or financial), and cost-sharing requirements. A number of private organizations also provide technical or financial assistance to landowners to promote the creation of wetlands. The Maryland departments of the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture are currently compiling information on public and private assistance available for wetlands creation projects. MDE also is developing a program to acknowledge the many organizations and individuals whose wetland creation projects are going unrecognized. This program also will serve as a clearinghouse so that others may learn from successful efforts If you are interested in creating a wetland, we would like to hear from you. MDE has established a ""network"" with other state and federal agencies that will respond to your inquiries, determine the feasibility of establishing a wetland on your property and identify additional potential assistance. Individuals, organizations, and businesses who are interested in undertaking a wetlands creation project, who may provide technical or financial assistance, or who have recently completed a project, are urged to contact Tony Abar, (410) 631-8059, Wetlands Restoration Initiative, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, MD 21224.

Electric-powered vehicles are not a new concept. In the early 1900s, more than 50 manufacturers were building electric-powered vehicles. By the late 1930s, gasoline-powered vehicles had crowded electric vehicles out of the market. It took the energy crisis of the 1970s with its gasoline shortages and warnings of our country's dependence on foreign oil to bring attention back to electric vehicles. In 1989, NESEA organized the first American Tour de Sol. Now in its tenth year, the event boasts an even more major car company entries than ever before, demonstrating just how far the industry has come in 10 short years. Entries for this year's event are broken up into five different categories including a production category, commuter category, hybrid category, solar commuter category and one person category. Some of the vehicles to be included at the event Washington, D.C. offering an unparalleled opportunity to demonstrate and market electric vehicles and other advanced technology vehicles to both businesses and the general public. People will have the opportunity to see solar and electric vehicles as well as other alternative fuel vehicles in motion, to look under the hood, and have a chance to talk to one of the many experts in attendance. The Maryland Department of the Environment is proud to be both a sponsor and organizer of the event in Maryland on May 13. Most vehicles participating in the road rally will arrive at Sandy Point State Park from 11 a.m. to noon. Activities are scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the event is free to people of all ages. Stop by and take part in this special event. Please call Ms. Fran Stierstorfer at (410) 631-3012 for more information.  1996 Tour de Sol competitors give tours and answer questions.  will be the General Motors EV1, the worlds first production electric vehicle, and the Toyota Prius, the worlds first production hybrid vehicle. Hybrid vehicles are powered by two different methods, usually electric  motors and a fossil-fuel engine. The Tour de Sol is more than just a road race, it is a traveling fair that is both educational and entertaining for people of all ages. There will be ten events held between New York and  Upper Potomac Tributary Team Works to Reduce Nutrients by Richard Douglas, Upper Potomac Tributary Team Coordinator The Upper Potomac Tributary Team has been in place for more than two years helping to reduce nutrients entering the rivers and streams in Western Maryland, the Upper Potomac River, and, ultimately, the Chesapeake Bay. The team's role includes advising state and local governments on nutrient reduction programs and policies, in particular related to agriculture, wastewater treatment plants, resource protection and urban development practices. The team, one of ten across Maryland has approximately 30 members appointed by the Governor that represent local government, agriculture, business, environmental organizations, citizens and other interests. The Upper Potomac Tributary Basin covers half of Garrett County to the west, half of Carroll County to the east, and all of Allegany, Washington, and Frederick Counties. Thomas Miller, Maryland Cooperative Extension Service, serves as the current team chair, while Elmer Weibley, Washington Soil Conservation District, serves as the current team vicechair. Members of the team not only act as policy advisors but also are involved in education and outreach efforts in the watershed. For example, the team held an erosion and sediment control workshop for Western Maryland developers and contractors in November in Cumberland. The Developed Land Workgroup, one of four team workgroups, concluded that many sediment pollution problems result from a lack of education, and decided to organize this workshop. Alison Rice and Craig Hartsock of Allegany County spearheaded the effort, developing the agenda and identifying speakers. The agenda was organized to encourage the 75 workshop attendees to voice their opinions and ask questions. The morning session, facilitated by Team Chair Thomas Miller and Phil Favero of the University of Maryland, included an overview of the state erosion and sediment control program and local permit procedures, plan requirements, a developer's viewpoint and stormwater management considerations. Team members facilitated table discussions during lunch on erosion and sediment control-related topics, and the workshop concluded with a ""green card"" certification course, given by Rick  Upper Potomac  Trickett of MDE. ""I felt the workshop was a success. Several attendees asked for more workshops in the future,"" said Alison Rice, an Allegany County planner who helped to organize the day's events. ""Many of the contractors attending the workshop received their green card for the very first time and admitted that they didn't realize that it was a requirement in Maryland. ""Everyone learned something at the workshop,"" said Mr. Craig Hartsock, district manager of the Allegany Soil Conservation District ""The workshop was an important first step in educating contractors and developers in Western Maryland on the Tributary Strategies process and the importance  of controlling non-point source runoff from construction sites. I was very impressed with the attitude and concern for the environment that was exhibited by the contractors and developers in attendance."" The Upper Potomac Tributary Team meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at 6 p.m. at the Western Maryland Research and Education Center in Keedysville. All meetings are open to the public, and visitors are welcomed and encouraged to participate.

By Mardel Knight Back in the 1940s asbestos was touted as the miracle fiber. By the mid-1960s it was used in building construction throughout the nation as insulation, ceiling tiles and fireproofing. By the late-1960s science had proven it was hazardous to our health. Yet, it is a product that is still found in many of Maryland's public buildings, including schools, because removing it is more hazardous than leaving the cancer-causing particles undisturbed. But thanks to a little used public reporting requirement, Maryland parents can find out more about their child's school environment by reviewing the school's asbestos management plan. Federal regulations, known as AHERA (Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act) that went into effect in 1987 requires all schools, both public and private, with the exception of forprofit schools, to have their buildings federally inspected for asbestoscontaining materials and to develop a plan to manage any pre-existing asbestos. In Maryland the covered schools are those that have any grades from preschool through grade 12, quired to correct any deficiencies that including church-exempt schools. All are found.

This annual notification must be completed even if the school has not removed any asbestos or made any other changes. The annual requirement also ensures that any new parents, staff or teachers are appropriately notified. The notification is usually made at the beginning of the school year via the first school newsletter, registration packets, or other school communication tool. The most important part of the management plan is the name, phone number and address of the designated contact person for the school or school district. This person has the special training needed to guarantee that schools are following the AHERA regulations and can help you with any questions that you have about the school's management plan. For assistance in finding contact information for your child's school, contact Mardel Knight or a member of MDE's Asbestos and Industrial Hygiene program at (410) 631-3801.  Rubble Landfill Third Party Checkers by Ed Dexter Maryland's rubble landfills are now required to have a ""third-party checker"" visually inspect every load of waste disposed of at a unlined rubble landfill as part of a unique checks and balances system created by last September's new rubble landfill regulations. These third-party checkers are independent, not part of the chain-of-command at the landfill and have no other responsibilities other than to inspect waste to ensure conformance with regulations and to protect against dumping of inappropriate materials that may harm the environment. Some landfill operators use engineers from commercial consulting companies as third-party checkers; others are using county health department personnel; and some of the counties, which already require commercial facilities to have a county checker on board, are allowing landfill-operator paid employees to fulfill MDE's requirements. In general, the duties of the thirdparty checker are to examine waste as it is received and insure that the waste is free of unacceptable waste, to inform the landfill operator when unacceptable waste is observed and to advise MDE of the occurrence and of the fate of the unacceptable waste. The checker is available to help the landfill operator comply with the landfill's Refuse Disposal Permit, to act as an extra set of eyes for MDE's Solid Waste Program inspectors and to document whether or not unacceptable waste is properly managed. Waste loads that will be rejected include loads observed to contain more than a small amount of unacceptable waste which can be separated out of the load, unacceptable waste which is practically inseparable from the acceptable materials and waste which cannot be readily visually identified. Since the program began January 20, MDE has received numerous reports from third-party checkers at landfills around Maryland. Thirdparty checkers have identified furniture and bags of household waste that they suspect have been tossed into rolloff containers at construction sites while sites are unattended. They also have removed containers of weed killer, pesticides, joint compound and even a 55-gallon drum of ""tar,"" which otherwise could have threatened groundwater resources. Questions concerning this program can be directed to the Solid Waste Program at (410) 631-3424.  Did you know that.... Maryland's Scrap Tire Program has achieved its FY98 goal and cleaned up 1.5 million tires?  page 7   Clip-N-Save!

GX002-03-15437238	"flash floods and floods...    the Awesome Power!    A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service    July 1992    NOAA, FEMA, and The American Red Cross       flash floods    #1 weather-related killer in the United States!    How do flash floods occur?    Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important role.    Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore, flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood deaths are due to  FLASH FLOODS .    Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms.    Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur downstream if the obstruction should suddenly release.        June 9, 1972 Black Hills     Rapid City, SD     15 inches of rain in 5 hours     238 fatalities     $164M in damages     Source: National Weather Service         PLAN AHEAD:    Identify where to go if told to evacuate. Choose several places...a friend's home or a motel in another town, or a shelter.    GO TO HIGHER GROUND!       Know your area's flood risk . For information, call your local National Weather Service office, Red Cross chapter, or local emergency management agency. Check your homeowner's or renter's insurance. Homeowners' policies do not cover flooding. Contact your insurance agent to find out how to get flood insurance.    flooding can occur NATIONWIDE!    Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet, and a depth of 2 feet will float your car!  NEVER  try to walk, swim, or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters,  STOP! TURN AROUND AND GO ANOTHER WAY.    SOME HISTORICAL NWS DATA      Dam Break        May 31, 1889 Johnstown, Pennsylvania...    the worst flood in United States history..    36-40 ft. wall of water...2,200 dead.

Flash Flood Events        June 14, 1990 Shadyside, Ohio...    4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours produced a 30-foot high wall   of water...    26 dead...damages $6-8M.    August 1, 1985 Cheyenne, Wyoming...    6 inches of rain in 3 hours...    12 dead...damages $61M.        Flooding Takes Many Forms...    Flash flooding occurs within 6 hours of the rain event.    Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more.    RIVER FLOOD    Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river basins with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding.    COASTAL FLOOD    Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding. Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis (tsoo-n„ -m z), sometimes referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or volcanic activity.    NOTE:  Coastal flooding caused by the storm surge associated with hurricanes is described in publication NOAA/PA 78019, ""Storm Surge and Hurric ane Safety.""    URBAN FLOOD    As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as they fill with water.    FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES    An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill with fast-moving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona took only 58 seconds to develop.    ICE JAM    Floating ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and stop the flow of water.       Environmental Clues...    Listen for.. .        distant thunder runoff from a faraway thunderstorm could be headed your   way.     Look out for.. .        water rising rapidly     Nearly half of all flash flood fatalities are auto related!    In your automobile...        look out for..flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas.     MANY FLASH FLOODS OCCUR AT NIGHT...BE PREPARED TO TAKE QUICK ACTION.       How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?        Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream   at 6 to 12 miles an hour.    When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred   to the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are   applied to the car.    But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up   the side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect,   the car weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises.    Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles .        Before the flood...    What  YOU  can do:        Know your flood risk and elevation above flood stage.    - Do your local streams or rivers flood easily? If so, be prepared to move   to a place of safety. Know your evacuation routes.    Keep your automobile fueled; if electric power is cut off, gas stations   may not be able to operate pumps for several days.    Store drinking water in clean bathtubs and in various containers. Water   service may be interrupted.    Keep a stock of food that requires little cooking and no refrigeration;   electric power may be interrupted.    Keep first aid supplies on hand.    Keep a NOAA Weather Radio, a battery-powered portable radio, emergency   cooking equipment, and flashlights in working order. Install check valves   in building sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the   drains of your home.     Assemble a disaster supplies kit containing: first aid kit, canned food and can opener, bottled water, rubber boots, rubber gloves, NOAA Weather Radio, battery-powered radio, flashlight, and extra batteries.    What YOUR community can do:        Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected   by power failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies.    River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management   agencies (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood   conditions and taking appropriate actions. Advanced warning provided by   early detection is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection   systems are available commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact   your local NWS office or emergency management agency for further information   on  LOCAL FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS .        STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM    by listening to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and television for the latest flash flood/flood  WATCHES, WARNINGS, and ADVISORIES.         NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE.  The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. Average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.    What to Listen For...        FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WATCH: Flash flooding or flooding is possible   within the designated WATCH area be alert.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD WARNING: Flash flooding or flooding has been reported   or is imminent take necessary precautions at once.    URBAN AND SMALL STREAM ADVISORY: Flooding of small streams, streets,   and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and urban storm drains,   is occurring.    FLASH FLOOD OR FLOOD STATEMENT: Follow-up information regarding a flash   flood/flood event.     The rule for being safe in a flooding situation is simple:  HEAD FOR HIGHER GROUND AND STAY AWAY FROM FLOOD WATERS!       TAKE ACTION!    When a flash flood  WATCH  is issued Be alert to signs of flash flooding and be ready to evacuate on a moment's notice.    When a flash flood  WARNING  is issued for your area, or the moment you realize that a flash flood is imminent, act quickly to save yourself. You may have only  SECONDS !    Go to higher ground Climb to safety!        Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots,   canyons, washes, etc.    Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt   to cross flowing streams.    If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood   waters. Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded roadways!    If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground.   Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep   them away. Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!    Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood   dangers.    Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly   during threatening conditions.     When you receive a  FLOOD WARNING :        If advised to evacuate, do so immediately.    Move to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water.    continue monitoring NOAA Weather Radio, television, or emergency broadcast   station for information.     During the flood:        Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding.    If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles,   STOP! Turn around and go another way.    Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is   not always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and   you could be stranded or trapped.    Children should NEVER play around high water, storm drains, viaducts,   or arroyos.     After the flood:        If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out.    Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the   water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call your local public   health authority.    Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing,   shelter, and first aid are available from the Red Cross.    Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and   other emergency operations.    Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned   to service.    Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings.   Flammables may be inside.    Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.        FAMILY DISASTER PLAN    Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.    Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services water, gas, electricity or telephones were cut off?    Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan...        I. Gather information about hazards.  Contact your local   National Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense   office, and American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters   could occur and how you should respond. Learn your community's warning   signals and evacuation plans.         II. Meet with your family to create a plan . Discuss the   information you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside   your home for an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood   in case you can't return home.
