Where 8 bits are allowed, the  EUC-KR  encoding is preferred.  These two encodings combine US-ASCII ( ISO 646 ) with the Korean standard  KS X 1001 :1992 [ 1 ]  (previously named KS C 5601:1987). In  North Korea , a separate character set called  KPS 9566  is in use, which is rather similar to KS X 1001.   The international  Unicode  standard contains special characters for representing the Korean language in the native  Hangul  phonetic system. There are two ways supported by Unicode. The way used by Windows is to have every one of the 11,571 syllable combinations as a code and a pre-formed font character. The other way is to encode  jamos , and to let the software combine them into correct combinations, which is not supported in Windows. Of course the former way needs more font memory, but gives the possibility of getting better shapes, since it is complicated to create fully correct combinations which may be preferred when creating documents.   There is also the possibility of simply stacking a (sequence of)  medial (s) ( jungseong )  and then a (sequence of)  final (s) ( jongseong ) and/or a Middle Korean pitch mark, if needed  on top of the (sequence of)  initial (s) ( choseong ), if the font has medial and final  jamos  with zero-width spacing that are inserted to the left of the cursor or caret, thus appearing in the right place below or to the right of the initial. If a syllable has a horizontal medial (  ,   ,   ,    or   ), the initial will probably appear further left in a complete syllable than is the case in pre-formed syllables due to the space that must be reserved for a vertical medial, giving an aesthetically poor appearance to what may be the only way to display Middle Korean Hangul text without resorting to images, romanisation, replacement of obsolete jamo or non-standard encodings. However, most current fonts do not support this.   The  Unicode  standard also has attempted to create a unified  CJK  character set that can represent Chinese ( Hanzi ) as well as the Japanese ( Kanji ) and Korean ( Hanja ) derivatives of this script through the  Han unification  process, which does not discriminate by language nor region for rendering Chinese characters, as long as the different typographic traditions have not resulted in major differences concerning what the character looks like  see  Image:Xin-jiu-zixing.png  for examples of characters whose appearance recently underwent only minor changes in Mainland China. Han unification has met with some criticism.     [ edit ]   Text input     See also:  Input method editor ,  List of input methods for UNIX platforms ,  Japanese input methods , and  Chinese input methods for computers     On a Korean computer keyboard, text is typically entered by simply pushing a key for the appropriate  Jamo ; the operating system creates each composite character on the fly. Depending on the IME and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the shift button. When all jamo making up a syllabic block have been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to Hanja or other special characters using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a separate key for this. Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported to varying degrees in word processors.   When using a keyboard from another language, most operating systems require the user to type using an original Korean keyboard layout, the most common of which is  2(du)-beolsik . This is in contrast to some other languages like Japanese, where text can be entered using a Romanization system on non-native keyboards.     [ edit ]   Hanja   Apart from the conversion issues mentioned above, some Korean fonts do not include hanja to start with. At the same time, current word processors do not allow the user to specify which font to use as a fallback for any hanja that may occur in a text. In that case, each sequence of hanja must be manually formatted to appear in the desired font.     [ edit ]   Special situations   Having text run in vertical lines is poorly or not at all supported by HTML and most word processors, although this is not an issue for modern Korean, as it is usually written horizontally. Until the second half of the 20th century, however, Korean was often written vertically. 15th century texts written in Hangul had pitch marks to the left of syllables, which are included in Unicode, although most current fonts do not adequately support them, either.   See the section on  #Character encodings  above for obsolete jamo.     [ edit ]   Programs   Notable programs specifically designed for Korean language-related use include:     Language recognition    A North Korean  speech recognition  program is said to recognise 100,000 words and to achieve a success rate of more than 90%. [ 2 ]   Mongnan  (  ;  KCC [ 3 ] , North Korea)   Optical character recognition software  with an alleged success rate of 99% for printed text and 95% for  handwriting recognition . [ 2 ]       Input method editors     Tan'gun  (  ;  Pyongyang Information Center , North Korea)  Allows the use of Hangul on English editions of Windows.

(Only works on Microsoft Windows)   Nabi  (  ),  ami  (  ; South Korea) - Allows to type Hangul on  Linux .       Word processors   All programs listed below include domestic Hangul fonts, non-Hangul fonts and a Hangul hanja  conversion utility.    Hangul  ( Haansoft , South Korea)   Ch'angdk  (  ; PIC, [ 3 ]  North Korea)  This popular program exists in an  MS-DOS  version developed in April 1990 [1]  and a Windows version developed in 1996. [ 4 ]  It includes a peculiar  personality cult  feature by which pressing  Ctrl+I  or  Ctrl+J  produces titles exalting  Kim Il-sung  and  Kim Jong-il , respectively.

The value of initial Jamo  is 18   The value of medial Jamo  is 0   The value of final Jamo  is 4     So, the formula will be {(18588)+(028)+4}+44032, and the result is 54620. It means the Unicode value of  is 54620 in decimal,  &#54620;  by the  numeric character reference , and U+D55C in standard Unicode notation.     [ edit ]   Hangul Compatibility Jamo Area   Hangul Compatibility Jamo Area  is a part of Unicode, which has been allocated for compatibility with the  KS X 1001  character set. Usually it is used for representing modern Hangul jamo and some obsolete Hangul Jamo, without distinguishing  initial  and  final .     [ edit ]   Hangul Jamo Area   Hangul Jamo Area  is a range of Unicode between U+1100U+11FF. It contains  initial jamo ,  medial jamo  and  final jamo , also including obsolete jamo.  Nalgaeset Hangul IME  and  Un Jamo Batang  represent obsolete Hangul using this area.     [ edit ]   Hanyang Private Use Area codes   Hangul (word processor)  ships with fonts from Hanyang Information and Communication. Their fonts map obsolete Hangul characters to the  Private Use Area  of Unicode. Despite the use of the Private Use Area instead of dedicated codepoints, Hanyangs mapping is currently the most popular way to represent obsolete Hangul in South Korea.

There are many theories to differentiate the Korean language histories  [ 2 ] ,  [ 3 ] ,  [ 4 ] ,  [ 5 ] ,  [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ,  [ 8 ] ,  [ 9 ] . It is distinct from  Proto-Korean  ( ), which is the reconstructed language from which Korean is hypothesized to have evolved. However, there is controversy whether Korean language actually has been separated from Altaic language. Old Korean may have been a  tonal language , although this has not been clearly established. [ 10 ]  The old Korean languages are divided into two. It is assumed that the Sillan dialect has its roots to middle and modern Korean, while the Buyeo language, spoken by Goguryeo and Baekje and other Korean states before the Three kingdoms period and the ones that co-existed in the era has similarities with the Sillan dialect.   Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present. Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. The point at which Old Korean became  Middle Korean  is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late Goryeo dynasty, and sometimes around the 15th century in the early  Joseon Dynasty . But it is usually thought that Middle Korea started at the establishment of Goryeo, and the standard language of Old Korean was changed from the Silla dialect to the Goryeo dialect.

The first texts in Old Korean date from the  Three Kingdoms  period. They are written using Chinese characters to represent the sound and grammar of the native language. Various systems were used, beginning with  ad hoc  approaches and gradually becoming codified in the scribal  idu  system and the  hyangchal  system used for poetry.   Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters, which are believed to have been first adapted into Korean in the late Three Kingdoms period.     [ edit ]   Writing system   Chinese script  was borrowed to represent the sound. Some [ who? ]  say that another writing system existed such as  Gugyeol , but Gugyeol was only a system of phonetic symbols for the Chinese script.     [ edit ]   Languages   In the age of Three Kingdoms, it has not been definitely proven that the three kingdoms all used the same language, but it is accepted by many scholars that the Three Kingdoms utilized similar languages, and that these may have been dialects of a single language [ 11 ] .

The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the hypothetical  Altaic  language family.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in North and South  Korea.    In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""      Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korean has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; partly because the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one, and partly due to the lack of cognates. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and a few linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty. Proponents of this theory cite old Korean cognates to Mongolian to support their claim.  Korean is similar to Altaic language in that they both have: the absence of grammatical elements such as number, genders, articles, fusional morphology, voice, relative pronouns, conjunctions, vowel harmony, and agglutination (Kim Namkil).   In the late 19th century, Homer B. Hulbert, an English linguist, theorised that Korean is related to the Dravidian languages of India. His argument was based on syntatic similarities between Dravidian languages and Korean. Dravidian and Korean are similar syntatically in that they both have: the word order subject-object-verb, postpositions instead of prepositions, no relative pronouns, modifiers in front of the head noun, copula and existential as two distinct grammatical parts of speech etc (Kim Namkil).    Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China , the former  Soviet Union , and the  United States .    Dialects   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

The symbol   ʼ  is used to denote the tensed consonants (  [pʼ] ,   [tʼ] ,   [cʼ] ,   [kʼ] , and   [sʼ] ) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure. However, it may be argued that such a manner of articulation can still be categorized as  glottalization , justifying the use of   ʼ .    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel   [ø]  and the close front rounded vowel   [y] , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs   [we]  and   [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel 'ㅟ' as   [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently.             i       siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'       iː       ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'             e       peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'       eː       ˈpeːda     beda     'cut'             ɛ       tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'       ɛː       ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'             a       ˈmal     mal     'horse'       aː       ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'             o       poˈli     bori     'barley'       oː       ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'             u       kuˈli     guri     'copper'       uː       ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'             ʌ       ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'       ʌː       ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'             ɯ       ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'       ɯː       ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j]  and   [w]  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                           wi   dwi   dwi 'back'           ɯi   ˈɯisa uisa 'doctor'        je   ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'           we   kwe gwe 'box'                        jɛ   ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'           wɛ   wɛ wae 'why'                        ja   ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'           wa   kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                        jo   ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                        ju   juˈli yuri 'glass'                                        jʌ   jʌːgi yeogi 'here'           wʌ   mwʌ mweo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s]  becomes palatalized as   [ʃ]  or   [ɕ]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [h]  becomes labialized   [ɸ]  before   [o]  and   [u]  and palatalized   [ç]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [p] ,   [t] ,   [c] , and   [k]  become voiced   [b] ,   [d] ,   [ɟ] , and   [ɡ]  between  sonorant  segments.    [l]  becomes alveolar flap   [ɾ]  between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   [r]  (also the initial   [n]  before   [i]  or   [y] ). For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   歷史 north:  ry ŏksa , south:  y eoksa  (history)   女子 north:  ny ŏja , south:  y eoja  (lady)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.           Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   ㅏ (a)   ㅑ (ya)   ㅗ (o)   ㅛ (yo)         ㅐ (ae)   ㅘ (wa)   ㅚ (oe)   ㅙ (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   ㅓ (eo)   ㅕ (yeo)   ㅜ (u)   ㅠ (yu)         ㅔ (e)   ㅝ (weo)   ㅟ (wi)   ㅞ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   ㅡ (eu)   ㅣ (i)   ㅢ (eui)      There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning.    Examples   Onomatopoeia:   퐁당퐁당 (pong-dang-pong-dang)  풍덩풍덩 (pung-deong-pung-deong) (Water splashing)    Adjectives/Adverbs:   무럭무럭 (mureokmureok) and 모락모락 (morakmorak) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but each has different connotations:  연기가 모락모락 나다 ( yeonggiga morakmorak nada ) Smoke rises up.  나무가 무럭무럭 자란다 ( Namuga mureokmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:   노랗다 (noratta) means plain yellow, while its negative, 누렇다 (nureotta) means very yellow  파랗다 (paratta) means plain blue, while its negative, 퍼렇다 (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:   잡다 (Japda) (to catch) → 잡았다 (Jabatda) (caught)  접다 (Jeopda) (to fold) → 접었다 (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:   아이고 (Aigo) and 어이구 (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""  어허 (Eoheo) and 아하 (Aha) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV word order, however, it must end with the verb.  In contrast to the Korean word order, in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Though it is worth noting that in colloquial English one might say 'Going to the store?', it is not considered standard, as it is in Korean.  Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .     Speech levels and honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb ending . Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean  have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    Speech levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  che , which means ""style.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb endings , while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final  endings  and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present   indicative  form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used   "

Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the hypothetical  Altaic  language family.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in North and South  Korea.    In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""      Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korean has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; partly because the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one, and partly due to the lack of cognates. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and a few linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty. Proponents of this theory cite old Korean cognates to Mongolian to support their claim.  Korean is similar to Altaic language in that they both have: the absence of grammatical elements such as number, genders, articles, fusional morphology, voice, relative pronouns, conjunctions, vowel harmony, and agglutination (Kim Namkil).   In the late 19th century, Homer B. Hulbert, an English linguist, theorised that Korean is related to the Dravidian languages of India. His argument was based on syntatic similarities between Dravidian languages and Korean. Dravidian and Korean are similar syntatically in that they both have: the word order subject-object-verb, postpositions instead of prepositions, no relative pronouns, modifiers in front of the head noun, copula and existential as two distinct grammatical parts of speech etc (Kim Namkil).    Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China , the former  Soviet Union , and the  United States .    Dialects   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

The symbol   ʼ  is used to denote the tensed consonants (  [pʼ] ,   [tʼ] ,   [cʼ] ,   [kʼ] , and   [sʼ] ) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure. However, it may be argued that such a manner of articulation can still be categorized as  glottalization , justifying the use of   ʼ .    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel   [ø]  and the close front rounded vowel   [y] , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs   [we]  and   [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel 'ㅟ' as   [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently.             i       siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'       iː       ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'             e       peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'       eː       ˈpeːda     beda     'cut'             ɛ       tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'       ɛː       ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'             a       ˈmal     mal     'horse'       aː       ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'             o       poˈli     bori     'barley'       oː       ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'             u       kuˈli     guri     'copper'       uː       ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'             ʌ       ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'       ʌː       ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'             ɯ       ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'       ɯː       ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j]  and   [w]  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                           wi   dwi   dwi 'back'           ɯi   ˈɯisa uisa 'doctor'        je   ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'           we   kwe gwe 'box'                        jɛ   ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'           wɛ   wɛ wae 'why'                        ja   ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'           wa   kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                        jo   ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                        ju   juˈli yuri 'glass'                                        jʌ   jʌːgi yeogi 'here'           wʌ   mwʌ mweo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s]  becomes palatalized as   [ʃ]  or   [ɕ]  before   [j]  or   [i] .

[p] ,   [t] ,   [c] , and   [k]  become voiced   [b] ,   [d] ,   [ɟ] , and   [ɡ]  between  sonorant  segments.    [l]  becomes alveolar flap   [ɾ]  between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   [r]  (also the initial   [n]  before   [i]  or   [y] ). For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   歷史 north:  ry ŏksa , south:  y eoksa  (history)   女子 north:  ny ŏja , south:  y eoja  (lady)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.           Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   ㅏ (a)   ㅑ (ya)   ㅗ (o)   ㅛ (yo)         ㅐ (ae)   ㅘ (wa)   ㅚ (oe)   ㅙ (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   ㅓ (eo)   ㅕ (yeo)   ㅜ (u)   ㅠ (yu)         ㅔ (e)   ㅝ (weo)   ㅟ (wi)   ㅞ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   ㅡ (eu)   ㅣ (i)   ㅢ (eui)      There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning.    Examples   Onomatopoeia:   퐁당퐁당 (pong-dang-pong-dang)  풍덩풍덩 (pung-deong-pung-deong) (Water splashing)    Adjectives/Adverbs:   무럭무럭 (mureokmureok) and 모락모락 (morakmorak) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but each has different connotations:  연기가 모락모락 나다 ( yeonggiga morakmorak nada ) Smoke rises up.  나무가 무럭무럭 자란다 ( Namuga mureokmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:   노랗다 (noratta) means plain yellow, while its negative, 누렇다 (nureotta) means very yellow  파랗다 (paratta) means plain blue, while its negative, 퍼렇다 (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:   잡다 (Japda) (to catch) → 잡았다 (Jabatda) (caught)  접다 (Jeopda) (to fold) → 접었다 (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:   아이고 (Aigo) and 어이구 (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""  어허 (Eoheo) and 아하 (Aha) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV wor  "
