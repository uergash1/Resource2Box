General George Washington first raised the Continental Army flag in 1776, a red-and-white striped flag with the British Union Jack where we now have stars. Several flag designs with 13 stripes were used in 1776 and 1777, until Congress established an official design on June 14, 1777 -- now observed as Flag Day. The act stated, ""That the Flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white, that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."" Washington explained it this way: ""We take the stars from heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty.""  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  the original 13 colonies, now states. This was the Star Spangled Banner"" of which Francis Scott Key wrote in 1814.  1818 Law Sets Final Form As other states entered the Union, it became obvious that stripes could not be added continually, so in 1818 Congress reestablished the 13-stripe flag for the original 13 colonies and allowed for additional stars for new states. The law specified that stripes should be horizontal, alternately red and white, and the union, or canton, should display 20 stars for the states then in the union. But it did not specify color shades or arrangement of the stars, and wide variation persisted. During the Civil War, gold stars were more common than white and the stars sometimes appeared in a circle. The first time the Stars and Stripes flew in a Flag Day celebration was in Hartford, Conn., 1861, the first summer of the Civil War. In the late 1800s, schools held Flag Day programs to contribute to the Americanization of immigrant children, and the observance caught on with individual communities. As a patriotic custom, the Stars and Stripes still flies in front of schools when classes are in session. In 1916, the president proclaimed a nationwide observance of Flag Day, but it was not until 1949 that Congress voted for Flag Day to be a permanent holiday. When the 49th and 50th stars were added in 1959 and 1960, the standards of design became even more precise. The regulated design calls for seven red and six white stripes, with the red stripes at top and bottom. The union of navy blue fills the upper left quarter from the top to the lower edge of the fourth red stripe. The stars have one point up and are in nine horizontal rows. The odd-numbered rows have six stars. The evennumbered rows have five stars, centered diagonally between the stars in the longer rows.  The First Flag No records confirm who designed the original Stars and Stripes, but historians believe Francis Hopkinson, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, probably modified the unofficial Continental flag into the design we now have. The State Navy Board of Pennsylvania, on May 29, 1777, commissioned Betsy Ross to sew flags for Navy vessels. Legend credits Ross with having sewn the first flag to meet the specifications outlined by Congress, while changing the stars from six points to five to speed her work. The flag was first carried in battle at Brandywine, Pa., in September 1777. It first flew over foreign territory in early 1778, at Nassau, Bahama Islands, where Americans captured a fort from the British. After Vermont and Kentucky became states in the 1790s, Congress approved adding two more stars and two more stripes to the group that represented   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS ""Old Glory""  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  The name ""Old Glory"" was first applied to the U.S. flag by a young sea captain who lived in Salem, Mass. On his twenty-first birthday, March 17, 1824, Capt. William Driver was presented a beautiful flag by his mother and a group of local young ladies. Driver was delighted with the gift. He exclaimed, ""I name her `Old Glory.'"" Then Old Glory accompanied the captain on his many voyages. Captain Driver quit the sea in 1837 and settled in Nashville, Tenn. On patriotic days, he displayed Old Glory proudly from a rope extending from his house to a tree across the street. After Tennessee seceded from the Union in 1861, Captain Driver hid Old Glory by sewing the flag inside a comforter. When Union soldiers entered Nashville on February 25, 1862, Driver removed Old Glory from its hiding place, carried the flag to the state capitol building, and proudly raised it for all to see. Shortly before his death, the old sea captain placed a small bundle into the arms of his daughter. He said to her, ""Mary Jane, this is my ship flag, Old Glory. It has been my constant companion. I love it as a mother loves her child. Cherish it as I have cherished it."" The flag remained as a precious heirloom in the Driver family until 1922. Then it was sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it is carefully preserved under glass today.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Pledge of Allegiance Thirty-one words which affirm the values and freedom that the American flag represents are recited while facing the flag as a pledge of Americans' loyalty to their country. The Pledge of Allegiance was written for the 400th anniversary, in 1892, of the discovery of America. A national committee of educators and civic leaders planned a public-school celebration of Columbus Day to center around the flag. Included with the script for ceremonies that would culminate in raising of the flag was the pledge. So it was in October 1892 Columbus Day programs that school children across the country first recited the Pledge of Allegiance this way:  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  I pledge allegiance to my Flag and to the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all. Controversy continues over whether the author was the chairman of the committee, Francis Bellamy -- who worked on a magazine for young people that published the pledge -- or James Upham, who worked for the publishing firm that produced the magazine. The pledge was published anonymously in the magazine and was not copyrighted. According to some accounts of Bellamy as author, he decided to write a pledge of allegiance, rather than a salute, because it was a stronger expression of loyalty -- something particularly significant even 27 years after the Civil War ended. ""One Nation indivisible"" referred to the outcome of the Civil War, and ""Liberty and Justice for all"" expressed  the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. The words ""my flag"" were replaced by ""the flag of the United States"" in 1923, because some foreignborn people might have in mind the flag of the country of their birth, instead of the U.S. flag. A year later, ""of America"" was added after ""United States."" No form of the pledge received official recognition by Congress until June 22, 1942, when it was formally included in the U.S. Flag Code. The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945. The last change in language came on Flag Day 1954, when Congress passed a law which added the words ""under God"" after ""one nation."" Originally, the pledge was said with the hand in the so-called ""Bellamy Salute,"" with the hand resting first outward from the chest, then the arm extending out from the body. Once Hitler came to power in Europe, some Americans were concerned that this position of the arm and hand resembled the salute rendered by the Nazi military. In 1942, Congress established the current practice of rendering the pledge with the right hand placed flat over the heart. Section 7 of the Federal Flag Code states that when not in military uniform, men should remove any headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, thereby resting the hand over the heart. People in military uniform should remain silent, face the flag and render the military salute. The Flag Code specifies that any future changes to the pledge would have to be with the consent of the president. The Pledge of Allegiance now reads:  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Guidelines for Display of the Flag Public Law 94-344, known as the Federal Flag Code, contains rules for handling and displaying the U.S. flag. While the federal code contains no penalties for misusing the flag, states have their own flag codes and may impose penalties. The language of the federal code makes clear that the flag is a living symbol. In response to a Supreme Court decision which held that a state law prohibiting flag burning was unconstitutional, Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act in 1989. It provides that anyone who knowingly desecrates the flag may be fined and/or imprisoned for up to one year. However, this law was challenged by the Supreme Court in a 1990 decision that the Flag Protection Act violates the First Amendment free speech protections. Important Things to Remember Traditional guidelines call for displaying the flag in public only from sunrise to sunset. However, the flag may be displayed at all times if it's illuminated during darkness. The flag should not be subject to weather damage, so it should not be displayed during rain, snow and wind storms unless it is an allweather flag. It should be displayed often, but especially on national and state holidays and special occasions. The flag should be displayed on or near the main building of public institutions, schools during school days, and polling places on election days. It should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously. When carried in procession with other flags, the U.S. flag should be either on the marching right (the flag's right) or to the front and center of the flag line. When displayed on a float in a parade, the flag should be hung from a staff or suspended so it falls free. It should not be draped over a vehicle. When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the U.S. flag should be on its own right (left to a person facing the wall) and its staff should be in front of the other flag's staff. In a group  of flags displayed from staffs, the U.S. flag should be at the center and the highest point. When flags of states, cities or organizations are flown on the same staff, the U.S. flag must be at the top (except during church services conducted at sea by Navy chaplains). When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first and lowered last. It must be on the right of other flags and no other flag should stand higher than it. Flags of other nations should be flown from separate staffs. International custom dictates that flags of different nations be displayed at the same height in peacetime and be approximately the same size.   On a casket, the union (blue field) should be at the deceased person's head and heart, over the left shoulder. But the flag should be removed before the casket is lowered into the grave and should never touch the ground. The flag may be flown at half-staff to honor a newly deceased federal or state government official by order of the president or the governor, respectively. On Memorial Day, the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon. Whenever the flag is displayed at half-staff, it should be first raised to the top. Lowering from half-staff is preceded by first raising it momentarily to the top. Other Things Not to Do with the Flag Out of respect for the U.S. flag, never:  dip it for any person or thing, even though state flags, regimental colors and other flags may be dipped as a mark of honor.  display it with the union down, except as a signal of distress.  let the flag touch anything beneath it: ground, floor, water, merchandise.  carry it horizontally, but always aloft.  fasten or display it in a way that will permit it to be damaged or soiled.  place anything on the flag, including letters, insignia, or designs of any kind.  use it for holding anything.  use it as wearing apparel, bedding or drapery. It should not be used on a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be attached to the uniform of patriotic organizations, military personnel, police officers and firefighters.  use the flag for advertising or promotion purposes or print it on paper napkins, boxes or anything else intended for temporary use and discard. During the hoisting or lowering of the flag or when it passes in parade or review, Americans should stand at attention facing the flag and place their right hand over the heart. Uniformed military members render the military salute. Men not in uniform should remove any headdress and hold it with their right hand at their left shoulder, the hand resting over the heart. Those who are not U.S. citizens should stand at attention. When the flag is worn out or otherwise no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.  When displayed flat against the wall on a speaker's platform, the flag should be above and behind the speaker with the union on the left side as the audience looks at it (again, the flag's right). When the flag hangs from a staff in a church or public place, it should appear to the audience on the left, the speaker's right. Any other flags displayed should be placed on the opposite side of the speaker.  The flag may cover a casket, but should not cover a statue or monument for unveiling. It should never be draped or drawn back in folds. Draped red, white and blue bunting should be used for decoration, with the blue at the top and red at the bottom.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Story of Taps The 24-note melancholy bugle call known as ""taps"" is thought to be a revision of a French bugle signal, called ""tattoo,"" that notified soldiers to cease an evening's drinking and return to their garrisons. It was sounded an hour before the final bugle call to end the day by extinguishing fires and lights. The last five measures of the tattoo resemble taps. The word ""taps"" is an alteration of the obsolete word ""taptoo,"" derived from the Dutch ""taptoe."" Taptoe was the command -- ""Tap toe!"" -- to shut (""toe to"") the ""tap"" of a keg. The revision that gave us present-day taps was made during America's Civil War by Union Gen. Daniel Adams Butterfield, heading a brigade camped at Harrison Landing, Va., near Richmond. Up to that time, the U.S. Army's infantry call to end the day was the French final call, ""L'Extinction des feux."" Gen. Butterfield decided the ""lights out"" music was too formal to signal the day's end. One day in July 1862, he recalled the tattoo music and hummed a version of it to an aide, who wrote it down in music. Butterfield then asked the brigade bugler, Oliver W. Norton, to play the notes and, after listening, lengthened and shortened them while keeping his original melody.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  He ordered Norton to play this new call at the end of each day thereafter, instead of the regulation call. The music was heard and appreciated by other brigades, who asked for copies and adopted this bugle call. It was even adopted by Confederate buglers. This music was made the official Army bugle call after the war, but not given the name ""taps"" until 1874. The first time taps was played at a military funeral may also have been in Virginia soon after Butterfield composed it. Union Capt. John Tidball, head of an artillery battery, ordered it played for the burial of a cannoneer killed in action. Not wanting to reveal the battery's position in the woods to the enemy nearby, Tidball substituted taps for the traditional three rifle volleys fired over the grave. Taps was played at the funeral of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson 10 months after it was composed. Army infantry regulations by 1891 required taps to be played at military funeral ceremonies. Taps now is played by the military at burial and memorial services and to signal the ""lights out"" command at day's end.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" This patriotic song, whose words were written by Francis Scott Key on Sept. 14, 1814, during the War of 1812 with Great Britain, was adopted by Congress as the U.S. national anthem in 1931. For many years before Congress made this choice, the song was popular and regulations for military bands required that it be played for ceremonies. Though Key wrote the words during the British bombardment of Fort McHenry at Baltimore, the melody was an English tune well known in America by the 1790s. It was the music for a poem, ""To Anacreon in Heaven,"" written about 1780 as the official song of a British social and musical organization, the Anacreontic Society. In fact, Key had used the music in 1805 to accompany another poem he wrote to honor Commodore Stephen Decatur.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  shells at it, about 400 of them landing inside. Four defenders were killed and 24 wounded. Key drafted the words of a poem on an envelope. The American detainees were sent ashore, the British fleet withdrew, and Key finished the poem and made a good copy of it in a Baltimore hotel the next day.  Poem an Instant Hit in Baltimore According to some accounts, Key showed the poem to relatives of his wife in Baltimore who had it printed immediately and distributed throughout the city on a handbill, entitled ""The Defense of Fort McHenry."" Within a couple of weeks, Baltimore newspapers published the poem. It gained instant popularity and was renamed ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" An actor sang it to the popular British tune at a public performance in Baltimore. Only with the start of the Civil War did ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" become a nationally popular song. During World War I, a drive began in Congress to make it the official anthem of America's armed forces. There were other contenders for the title, including ""America the Beautiful"" and ""Yankee Doodle."" Maryland legislators and citizens were among the most active groups and individuals who pressed to get Francis Scott Key's words and accompanying English tune ratified into law as the country's first national anthem. That finally happened when President Herbert Hoover signed legislation on March 3, 1931. The anthem has four verses, each ending with the line, ""O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.""  Key Detained While Negotiating Key was a well known 34-year-old Washington, D.C., lawyer-poet. The British had captured Washington and taken William Beanes, a physician, prisoner. They were holding him aboard ship in their fleet off the Baltimore shore. Friends of Beanes persuaded Key to negotiate his release. Key went out to the British fleet and succeeded in gaining Beanes' release but, because the British planned to attack Baltimore at that time, both were detained. During the night of Sept. 13-14, Key watched the bombardment of Baltimore from the deck of a British ship. Although rain obscured the fort during the night, at daybreak he could see the American flag still flying from Fort McHenry. The fort still stood after the British had fired some 1,800 bombs, rockets and   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS National cemeteries in the United States for military veterans and service members began during the Civil War, near the battlefields, military hospitals and campgrounds of the war. On July 17, 1862, President Lincoln signed legislation authorizing the federal government to purchase ground for use as national cemeteries ""for soldiers who shall have died in the service of the country."" Up to then, the dead were hastily buried in fields, churchyards, or close to hospitals or prison camps where they died. After the war, Army crews searched the countryside to find and rebury the Union dead in the original 14 national cemeteries. The remains of Confederate prisoners of war were included, although it was not until 1906 that legislation approved marking their graves with headstones. The reinterment process took five years and resulted in establishing 50 more cemeteries to hold a quarter-million remains. They were reburied with honor. The new cemeteries were enclosed by brick walls and entered through ornate gates. However, the identities of nearly half of the Union dead who are buried in national cemeteries are unknown. A few of the national cemeteries developed around Union prisoner of war camps, where a large numbers of Confederate soldiers died. Eight years after the war ended, Congress opened national cemeteries to all honorably discharged veterans of the Union forces. Legislation after World War I opened them to American veterans of all wartime service. Finally, after World War II, Congress expanded eligibility for burial to all veterans of U.S. armed forces, American war veterans of allied armed forces and veterans' spouses and dependent children. From their founding until 1973, national cemeteries were operated by the Department of the Army. Today, the National Cemetery Administration is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA operates national cemeteries throughout the United  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  The National Cemetery Administration States and Puerto Rico. The Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army also administer several national cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C. Veterans of every conflict in which the U.S. participated -- from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf -- are buried in VA's national cemeteries. In addition to providing a gravesite, VA provides a headstone or marker, and perpetually cares for the grave at no cost to the veteran's family or heirs.

Maj. Gen. John A. Logan declared it should be May 30. It is believed the date was chosen because flowers would be in bloom all over the country. The first large observance was held that year at Arlington National Cemetery, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. The ceremonies centered around the mourning-draped veranda of the Arlington mansion, once the home of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Various Washington officials, including Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant, presided over the ceremonies. After speeches, children from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphan Home and members of the GAR made their way through the cemetery, strewing flowers on both Union and Confederate graves, reciting prayers and singing hymns. Local Observances Claim To Be First Local springtime tributes to the Civil War dead already had been held in various places. One of the first occurred in Columbus, Miss., April 25, 1866, when a group of women visited a cemetery to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers who had fallen in battle at Shiloh. Nearby were the graves of Union soldiers, neglected because they were the enemy. Disturbed at the sight of the bare graves, the women placed some of their flowers on those graves, as well. Today, cities in the North and the South claim to be the birthplace of Memorial Day in 1866. Both Macon and Columbus, Ga., claim  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  the title, as well as Richmond, Va. The village of Boalsburg, Pa., claims it began there two years earlier. A stone in a Carbondale, Ill., cemetery carries the statement that the first Decoration Day ceremony took place there on April 29, 1866. Carbondale was the wartime home of Gen. Logan. Approximately 25 places have been named in connection with the origin of Memorial Day, many of them in the South where most of the war dead were buried. Official Birthplace Declared In 1966, Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, N.Y., the ""birthplace"" of Memorial Day. There, a ceremony on May 5, 1866, honored local veterans who had fought in the Civil War. Businesses closed and residents flew flags at half-staff. Supporters of Waterloo's claim say earlier observances in other places were either informal, not community-wide or one-time events. By the end of the 19th century, Memorial Day ceremonies were being held on May 30 throughout the nation. State legislatures passed proclamations designating the day, and the Army and Navy adopted regulations for proper observance at their facilities. It was not until after World War I, however, that the day was expanded to honor those who have died in all American wars. In 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by an act of Congress, though it is still often called Decoration Day. It was then also placed on the last Monday in May, as were some other federal holidays.   Some States Have Confederate Observances Many Southern states also have their own days for honoring the Confederate dead. Mississippi celebrates Confederate Memorial Day on the last Monday of April, Alabama on the fourth Monday of April, and Georgia on April 26. North and South Carolina observe it on May 10, Louisiana on June 3 and Tennessee calls that date Confederate Decoration Day. Texas celebrates Confederate Heroes Day January 19 and Virginia calls the last Monday in May Confederate Memorial Day. Gen. Logan's order for his posts to decorate graves in 1868 ""with the choicest flowers of springtime"" urged: ""We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. ... Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no neglect, no ravages of time, testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic."" The crowd attending the first Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery was approximately the same size as those that attend today's observance, about 5,000 people. Then, as now, small American flags were placed on each grave -- a tradition followed at many national cemeteries today. In recent years, the custom has grown in many families to decorate the graves of all departed loved ones. The origins of special services to honor those  who die in war can be found in antiquity. The Athenian leader Pericles offered a tribute to the fallen heroes of the Peloponnesian War over 24 centuries ago that could be applied today to the 1.1 million Americans who have died in the nation's wars: ""Not only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions, but there dwells also an unwritten memorial of them, graven not on stone but in the hearts of men."" To ensure the sacrifices of America's fallen heroes are never forgotten, in December 2000, the U.S. Congress passed and the president signed into law ""The National Moment of Remembrance Act,"" P.L. 106-579, creating the White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance. The commission's charter is to ""encourage the people of the United States to give something back to their country, which provides them so much freedom and opportunity"" by encouraging and coordinating commemorations in the United States of Memorial Day and the National Moment of Remembrance. The National Moment of Remembrance encourages all Americans to pause wherever they are at 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day for a minute of silence to remember and honor those who have died in service to the nation. As Moment of Remembrance founder Carmella LaSpada states: ""It's a way we can all help put the memorial back in Memorial Day.""   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origins of Veterans Day In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. This site, on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River and the city of Washington, D.C., became the focal point of reverence for America's veterans. Similar ceremonies occurred earlier in England and France, where an unknown soldier was buried in each nation's highest place of honor (in England, Westminster Abbey; in France, the Arc de Triomphe). These memorial gestures all took place on November 11, giving universal recognition to the celebrated ending of World War I fighting at 11 a.m., November 11, 1918 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month). The day became known as ""Armistice Day."" Armistice Day officially received its name in America in 1926 through a Congressional resolution. It became a national holiday 12 years later by similar Congressional action. If the idealistic hope had been realized that World War I was ""the War to end all wars,"" November 11 might still be called Armistice Day. But only a few years after the holiday was proclaimed, war broke out in Europe. Sixteen and one-half million Americans took part. Four hundred seven thousand of them died in service, more than 292,000 in battle.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  On Memorial Day 1958, two more unidentified American war dead were brought from overseas and interred in the plaza beside the unknown soldier of World War I. One was killed in World War II, the other in the Korean War. In 1984, an unknown serviceman from the Vietnam War was placed alongside the others. The remains from Vietnam were exhumed May 14, 1998, identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and removed for burial. To honor these men, symbolic of all Americans who gave their lives in all wars, an Army honor guard, the 3rd U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard), keeps day and night vigil. A law passed in 1968 changed the national commemoration of Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. It soon became apparent, however, that November 11 was a date of historic significance to many Americans. Therefore, in 1978 Congress returned the observance to its traditional date.  National Ceremonies Held at Arlington The focal point for official, national ceremonies for Veterans Day continues to be the memorial amphitheater built around the Tomb of the Unknowns. At 11 a.m. on November 11, a combined color guard representing all military services executes ""Present Arms"" at the tomb. The nation's tribute to its war dead is symbolized by the laying of a presidential wreath. The bugler plays ""taps."" The rest of the ceremony takes place in the amphitheater. Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington and elsewhere are coordinated by the President's Veterans Day National Committee. Chaired by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the committee represents national veterans organizations. Governors of states and U.S. territories appoint Veterans Day chairpersons who, in cooperation with the National Committee and the Department of Defense, arrange and promote local ceremonies.  Armistice Day Changed To Honor All Veterans The first celebration using the term Veterans Day occurred in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1947. Raymond Weeks, a World War II veteran, organized ""National Veterans Day,"" which included a parade and other festivities, to honor all veterans. The event was held on November 11, then designated Armistice Day. Later, U.S. Representative Edward Rees of Kansas proposed a bill that would change Armistice Day to Veterans Day. In 1954, Congress passed the bill that President Eisenhower signed proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day. Raymond Weeks received the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Reagan in November 1982. Weeks' local parade and ceremonies are now an annual event celebrated nationwide.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Arlington National Cemetery Almost four million people a year visit the national cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., where a constant vigil is maintained at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Arlington National Cemetery is the site of the changing of a military guard around the clock daily. A stone coffin bearing the body of an unidentified soldier of World War I -- entombed on Veterans Day 1921 -- is the visible part of the tomb, while crypts next to it under the terrace bear the unknown American service members of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars (the remains from Vietnam were exhumed May 14, 1998, identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and removed for burial). Each Memorial Day and Veterans Day, a presidential wreath is laid at the tomb. This may explain why Arlington is America's most well-known national cemetery, even though it is not the largest or the oldest. Some 230,000 veterans and dependents are buried on the cemetery's 612 acres. From Pierre L'Enfant, George Washington's aide during the American Revolution, to American service members killed during Operation Desert Storm, Arlington holds the remains of veterans representing every military action the United States has fought.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  bitter grudge against the South that Union Brig. Gen. Montgomery Meigs bore, and the need for burial space for the Union dead, this commander of forces at Arlington urged the federal government to convert 200 acres of Lee's property to a cemetery. Meigs ordered burials near the house to make the grounds uninhabitable after the war. The first soldier was buried in Arlington in May 1864. By war's end, 16,000 graves filled the spaces close to Arlington House. Though the Supreme Court ruled finally in favor of the heir to the property, the eldest Lee son ceded title to the government for $150,000 and renounced any thought of living in Arlington House. From the portico of the mansion, the first official Memorial Day was proclaimed in 1868.  Burials Restricted Whereas after the Civil War, only the poor or unidentified were entombed at Arlington, now it is a burial site particularly coveted by veterans and their families. Space for in-ground burials is restricted to those who die on active duty, have had 20 years of service, or earned certain military decorations, and their spouses and dependents. Any honorably discharged veterans and dependents may have their cremated remains inurned in Arlington's columbarium. Honors are rendered daily by military units bearing a flag-draped coffin, firing a rifle volley and performing taps. Numerous veterans and civic groups hold memorial services in the cemetery's marble amphitheater. Monuments have been erected from time to time to memorialize specific groups of military members or veterans buried there. Prominent Americans buried at Arlington include: Presidents John F. Kennedy and William H. Taft; World War I General of the Armies John J. Pershing; Generals Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall of World War II; and Generals Daniel ""Chappie"" James and Maxwell Taylor of the Vietnam War.  Union Seized Lee's Property The cemetery's origins go back to just before the Civil War. George Washington Parke Custis, adopted son of the first president, owned a 1,100-acre plantation and constructed on it a memorial to Washington named Arlington House, which held the world's largest collection of memorabilia related to the president. Ownership of his estate passed to Custis' daughter, who had married Robert E. Lee, and they lived in Arlington House for more than 30 years. The Lee family fled when the Civil War was imminent. The Union seized the property because of its strategic location overlooking Washington. Because of the   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The POW/MIA Flag  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  who gave up their freedom protecting ours. Three years later, in 1982, the POW/MIA flag became the only flag other than the Stars and Stripes to fly over the White House in Washington, D.C. On August 10, 1990, Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, designating the POW/MIA flag: ""The symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.""  Displaying the POW/MIA Flag In 1971, Mrs. Michael Hoff, the wife of a U.S. military officer listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War, developed the idea for a national flag to remind every American of the U.S. servicemembers whose fates were never accounted for during the war. The black and white image of a gaunt silhouette, a strand of barbed wire and an ominous watchtower was designed by Newt Heisley, a former World War II pilot. Some claim the silhouette is a profile of Heisley's son, who contracted hepatitis while training to go to Vietnam. The virus ravaged his body, leaving his features hallow and emaciated. They suggest that while staring at his son's sunken features, Heisley saw the stark image of American servicemembers held captive under harsh conditions. Using a pencil, he sketched his son's profile, creating the basis for a symbol that would come to have a powerful impact on the national conscience. By the end of the Vietnam War, more than 2,500 servicemembers were listed by the Department of Defense as Prisoner of War (POW) or Missing in Action (MIA). In 1979, as families of the missing pressed for full accountability, Congress and the president proclaimed the first National POW/MIA Recognition Day to acknowledge the families' concerns and symbolize the steadfast resolve of the American people to never forget the men and women Congress designated the third Friday of September as National POW/MIA Recognition Day and ordered prominent display of the POW/MIA flag on this day and several other national observances, including Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day and Veterans Day. The 1998 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) mandates that on these national observances, the POW/MIA flag is to be flown over the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Korean and Vietnam Veterans War Memorials, the offices of the Secretaries of State, Defense and Veterans Affairs, offices of the Director of the Selective Service System, every major military installation (as directed by the Secretary of Defense), every post office and all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and national cemeteries. The act also directs VA medical centers to fly the POW/MIA flag on any day on which the flag of the United States is displayed. When displayed from a single flag pole, the POW/MIA flag should fly directly below, and be no larger than, the United States flag. If on separate poles, the U.S. flag should always be placed to the right of other flags. On the six national observances for which Congress has ordered display of the POW/ MIA flag, it is generally flown immediately below or adjacent to the United States flag as second in order of precedence.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origin of the VA Motto  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address As the nation braced itself for the final throes of the Civil War, thousands of spectators gathered on a muddy Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol to hear President Lincoln's second inaugural address. It was March 4, 1865, a time of great uneasiness. In just over one month, the war would end and the president would be assassinated. President Lincoln framed his speech on the moral and religious implications of the war; rhetorically questioning how a just God could unleash such a terrible war upon the nation. ""If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses in the providence of God, ... and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offenses came."" With its deep philosophical insights, critics have hailed the speech as one of Lincoln's best. As the speech progressed, President Lincoln turned from the divisive bitterness at the war's roots to the unifying task of reconciliation and reconstruction. In the speech's final paragraph, the president delivered his prescription for the nation's recovery. ""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" With the words, ""To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan,"" President Lincoln affirmed the government's obligation to care for those injured during the war and to provide for the families of those who perished on the battlefield. Today, a pair or metal plaques bearing those words flank the entrance to the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA is the federal agency responsible for  serving the needs of veterans by providing health care, disability compensation and rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, burial in a national cemetery, and other benefits and services. Lincoln's immortal words became the VA motto in 1959, when the plaques were installed, and can be traced to Sumner G. Whittier, administrator of what was then called the Veterans Administration. A document on VA medical history prepared for the congressional Committee on Veterans' Affairs and titled, ""To care for him who shall have borne the battle,"" details how the words became VA's motto. ""He (Whittier) worked no employee longer or harder than himself to make his personal credo the mission of the agency. What was that credo? Simply the words of Abraham Lincoln, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan. To indicate the mission of his agency's employees, Mr. Whittier had plaques installed on either side of the main entrance."" President Lincoln's words have stood the test of time, and stand today as a solemn reminder of VA's commitment to care for those injured in our nation's defense and the families of those killed in its service.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS When should the flag be flown at half-staff? An easy way to remember when to fly the United States flag at half-staff is to consider when the whole nation is in mourning. These periods of mourning are proclaimed either by the president of the United States, for national remembrance, or the governor of a state or territory, for local remembrance, in the event of a death of a member or former member of the federal, state or territorial government or judiciary. The heads of departments and agencies of the federal government may also order that the flag be flown at half-staff on buildings, grounds and naval vessels under their jurisdiction. On Memorial Day the flag should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon only, then raised briskly to the top of the staff until sunset, in honor of the nation's battle heroes. In the early days of our country, no regulations existed for flying the flag at half-staff and, as a result, there were many conflicting policies. But on March 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower issued a proclamation on the proper times. The flag should fly at half-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president. It is to fly 10 days at half-staff after the death of the vice president, the chief justice or a retired chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, or the speaker of the House of Representatives. For an associate justice of the Supreme Court, a member of the Cabinet, a former vice president, the president pro tempore of the Senate, the majority leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, or the minority leader of the House of Representatives the flag is to be displayed at half-staff from the day of death until interment.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Flying the American Flag at Half Staff The flag is to be flown at half-staff at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels in the Washington, D.C., area on the day and day after the death of a United States senator, representative, territorial delegate, or the resident commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It should also be flown at halfstaff on all federal facilities in the state, congressional district, territory, or commonwealth of these officials. Upon the death of the governor of a state, territory or possession, the flag should be flown at half-staff on all federal facilities in that governor's state, territory or possession from the day of death until interment. The president may order the flag to be flown at half-staff to mark the death of other officials, former officials, or foreign dignitaries. In addition to these occasions, the president may order half-staff display of the flag after other tragic events. The flag should be briskly run up to the top of the staff before being lowered slowly to the half-staff position.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origins of Flag Day That the flag of the United States shall be of thirteen stripes of alternate red and white, with a union of thirteen stars of white in a blue field, representing the new constellation. This was the resolution adopted by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. The resolution was made following the report of a special committee which had been assigned to suggest the flag's design. A flag of this design was first carried into battle on September 11, 1777, in the Battle of the Brandywine. The American flag was first saluted by foreign naval vessels on February 14, 1778, when the Ranger, bearing the Stars and Stripes and under the command of Captain Paul Jones, arrived in a French port. The flag first flew over a foreign territory in early 1778 at Nassau, Bahama Islands, where Americans captured a British fort. Observance of the adoption of the flag was not soon in coming, however. Although there are many claims to the first official observance of Flag Day, all but one took place more than an entire century after the flag's adoption in 1777. The first claim was from a Hartford, Conn., celebration during the first summer of 1861. In the late 1800s, schools all over the United States held Flag Day programs to contribute to the Americanization of immigrant children, and the observance caught on with individual communities. The most recognized claim, however, comes from New York. On June 14, 1889, Professor George Bolch, principal of a free kindergarten for the poor of New York City, had his school hold patriotic ceremonies to observe the anniversary of the Flag Day resolution. This initiative attracted attention from the State Department of Education, which arranged to have the day observed in all public schools thereafter. Soon the state legislature passed a law making it the responsibility of the state superintendent of public schools to ensure that schools hold observances for Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Flag Day. In 1897, the governor  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  of New York ordered the displaying of the flag over all public buildings in the state, an observance considered by some to be the first official recognition of the anniversary of the adoption of the flag outside of schools. Another claim comes from Philadelphia. In 1893, the Society of Colonial Dames succeeded in getting a resolution passed to have the flag displayed on all of the city's public buildings. Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, a direct descendant of Benjamin Franklin and the president of the Colonial Dames of Pennsylvania, that same year tried to get the city to call June 14 Flag Day. Resolutions by women were not granted much notice, however, and it was not until May 7, 1937, that Pennsylvania became the first state to establish the June 14 Flag Day as a legal holiday. Flag Day is a nationwide observance today, but Pennsylvania is the only state that recognizes it as a legal holiday. Bernard J. Cigrand, a school teacher in Waubeka, Wisconsin, reportedly spent years trying to get Congress to declare June 14 as a national holiday. Although his attempts failed, the day was widely observed. ""Father of Flag Day"" honors have been given to William T. Kerr, who was credited with founding the American Flag Day Association in 1888 while still a schoolboy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both President Wilson, in 1916, and President Coolidge, in 1927, issued proclamations asking for June 14 to be observed as the National Flag Day. But it wasn't until August 3, 1949, that Congress approved the national observance, and President Harry Truman signed it into law.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The American Bald Eagle The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782, when it was placed with outspread wings on the Great Seal of our country. It appears in many government institutions and on official documents, making it the most pictured bird in all of America. The eagle appears on the president's flag, the mace of the House of Representatives, military insignia, and billions of onedollar bills. The bald eagle first appeared as an American symbol on a Massachusetts copper cent coined in 1776. Since then it has appeared on the reverse side of many U.S. coins, notably the silver dollar, halfdollar and quarter, as well as the gold coins which were christened the eagle, half eagle, quarter eagle, and double eagle. For six years, the members of Congress held a bitter dispute over what the national emblem should be. It wasn't until 1789 that the bald eagle was finally chosen to represent the new nation. One of the most prominent opponents to the bald eagle's status was Benjamin Franklin. In a letter to a friend, Franklin wrote: I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country; he is a bird of bad moral character; like those among men who live by sharping and robbing, he is generally poor, and often very lousy. The turkey is a much more respectable bird and withal a true, original native of America. But not all of Congress shared Franklin's sentiments. Bald eagles, like other eagles worldwide, had been seen by many as symbols of strength, courage, freedom and immortality for generations. And, unlike other eagles, the bald eagle was indigenous only to North America.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Some eagles have become notable in American history. ""Old Abe,"" the mascot of a Wisconsin regiment during the Civil War, was a constant target of enemy riflemen, but survived 42 battle engagements relatively unscathed. Today, the American bald eagle is protected under the National Emblem Act of 1940. Although once plentiful throughout the continental United States, the bald eagle population has greatly declined in recent times. Farmers and fishermen have killed many eagles for getting too close to their poultry or fishing nets; game keepers have captured them for falconry; and pesticides have killed many eagles. Most of the bald eagle population can now be found in northern regions of North America and Florida breeding sanctuaries. President John F. Kennedy wrote to the Audubon Society: The Founding Fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation. The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird aptly symbolizes the strength and freedom of America. But as latter-day citizens we shall fail our trust if we permit the eagle to disappear.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Gun Salutes Today, the firing of guns is seen as a great honor bestowed upon both military and political officials. Firing guns at the approach of a party demonstrates not only welcome but also respect and trust. In former times, however, firing all guns could leave a ship, fort or battery virtually defenseless, for the reloading took a great deal of time. For this reason, gun salutes were seen as a great honor. The practice of firing gun salutes was well established by the sixteenth century, although gun salutes had existed for centuries. Later, the number of guns to fire was designated for various ceremonies, honors and officials -- in relation to their importance and position. The firing of three rifle volleys (rounds) over the graves of fallen armed forces members and political leaders can be traced to the European dynastic wars, when fighting was halted to remove the dead and wounded. Once an area was cleared of casualties, three volleys were sent into the air as a signal to resume fighting. By about 1730, the British navy was prescribing 21 guns for certain anniversary dates as a personal salute to members of the royal family. This was not mandatory, however. The 21-gun salute was adopted as the standard salute for royalty in 1808. The United States fired a ""national salute,"" on special occasions and during times of mourning, of one gun for each state in the union until 1841, when the salute was standardized at 21 guns. It was customary at that time, when naval vessels were visiting foreign ports, to salute the flag of that nation with the number of guns present in the foreign country's national salute. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for vessels visiting the United States to fire a salute that, in 1841, doubled the number of guns prescribed by most other nations (42 as compared to 21). Also, it would have been internationally discour-  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  teous to offer a salute to a foreign port with fewer guns then prescribed by our own national salute. The British proposed that the two nations exchange salutes gun for gun when their vessels visited American ports in the nineteenth century. In 1875, the British minister at Washington, D.C., and the U.S. secretary of state decided to work towards an agreement on salutes. On August 18, 1875, the United States formally adopted the 21-gun salute, the number prescribed by Britain, France and other nations. No one can explain why the number 21 was chosen for national salutes. In ancient cultures, numerology, the study of numbers, developed symbolism behind most numbers. These cultures believed the number seven to be sacred and, therefore, it is believed, multiples of seven would be looked upon favorably (hence 21). Other gun salutes vary from five guns (the lowest) to 21 guns (the highest) by increments of two, and are prescribed in accordance with occasion and level of importance of those honored. It is generally believed that gun salutes are set off in odd numbers because of an old naval superstition that even numbers are unlucky.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Flower of Remembrance In Flanders Fields In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved, and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields. This was the poem written by World War I Colonel John McCrae, a surgeon with Canada's First Brigade Artillery. It expressed McCrae's grief over the ""row on row"" of graves of soldiers who had died on Flanders' battlefields, located in a region of western Belgium and northern France. The poem presented a striking image of the bright red flowers blooming among the rows of white crosses and became a rallying cry to all who fought in the First World War. The first printed version of it reportedly was in December 1915, in the British magazine Punch. McCrae's poem had a huge impact on two women, Anna E. Guerin of France and Georgia native Moina Michael. Both worked hard to initiate the sale of artificial poppies to help orphans and others left destitute by the war. By the time Guerin established the first sale in the U.S., in 1920 with the help of the American Legion, the poppy was well known in the allied countries -- America, Britain, France, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- as the ""Flower of Remembrance."" Proceeds from that first sale went to the American and French Children's League.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Guerin had troubles with the distribution of the poppies in early 1922 and sought out Michael for help. Michael had started a smaller-scaled Poppy Day during a YMCA conference she was attending in New York and wanted to use the poppies as a symbol of remembrance of the war. Guerin, called the ""Poppy Lady of France"" in her homeland, and Michael, later dubbed ""The Poppy Princess"" by the Georgia legislature, went to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for help. The poppy was adopted as the official memorial flower of the VFW at its national convention in Seattle, Wash., in August 1922, following the first nationwide distribution of poppies ever conducted by any veterans organization. In 1923, faced by a shortage of poppies from French manufacturers, the VFW relied on New York florists to make up the difference. This was a huge setback, however, and led to the idea by VFW officials to use unemployed and disabled veterans to produce the artificial flower. This concept was approved in late 1923 and the first poppy factory was built in Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1924. This provided a practical means of assistance to veterans and also ensured a steady, reliable source of poppies. Veterans at Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities and veterans homes help assemble the poppies, and each year the VFW distributes roughly 14 million worldwide. It was around the same time the first poppy factory was built that the VFW registered the name ""Buddy Poppy"" with the U.S. Patent Office. The term ""Buddy"" was coined by the poppy makers as a tribute to their comrades who did not come home from the war or who were scarred and crippled for life. The VFW celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Buddy Poppy as its official flower in 1997. While profits from its sales have helped countless veterans and their widows, widowers and orphans over the years, the poppy itself survives as a perpetual tribute to those who have given their lives for the nation's freedom.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Activities for Veterans Day Veterans Day is an excellent occasion for schools and local communities to produce a variety of meaningful cooperative programs. Participation by veterans organizations and other patriotic groups can enhance many of the activities suggested in this guide. 1. Veterans Day Ceremony Depending on the facilities available, an indoor assembly program can provide a most meaningful tribute to Veterans Day. The scope of such a program may be large enough to permit invitations to the community at large. This ceremony outline represents a typical one-hour program. Prelude and Posting of Colors -- As the audience enters to be seated, a school or community musical organization may offer several appropriate selections. A procession and posting of the Nation's colors (the American Flag) is always a stirring event. Local veterans service organizations often participate in such programs with their impressive array of military banners and American flags. Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag and Singing of the National Anthem -- The program chairperson, school principal or student body president should invite the audience to stand and join in the Pledge of Allegiance and singing of the National Anthem. Introductory Remarks -- Brief introductory remarks set the tone for the program. The following remarks may be used or, if desired, the President's Veterans Day Proclamation, which the White House posts on the Internet shortly before Veterans Day at http://www.whitehouse.gov, may be read. When Francis Scott Key wrote the ""Star Spangled Banner"" almost 200 years ago, he called America, ""the land of the free and the home of the brave."" Those words are as true today as they were then.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Throughout this Nation's history, America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and coastguardsmen have bravely answered the call to defend our freedom, to aid our friends and allies, and to turn back aggressors. We can never fully repay our debt of gratitude to the more than 650,000 American servicemembers who died in battle or the 1.4 million who were wounded. We can, however, recognize and thank the more than 25 million veterans still living today. These words are inscribed on the Korean War Memorial in Washington, D.C.: ""Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met."" Those words apply equally to many of our World War I, World War II, Vietnam War and Gulf War veterans as well. They apply to today's active duty servicemembers -- tomorrow's veterans -- who are helping to maintain peace throughout the world. Today, it is our privilege to say ""thank you"" to all of America's veterans, to let them know that we appreciate them for their service and honor them for their sacrifices. The price of freedom is high. We cannot afford to forget those willing to pay it. Today, we celebrate America's veterans for keeping this Nation ""the land of the free and the home of the brave."" Special Musical Selection -- A band or choral group should offer one of the more impressive patriotic selections available.   C  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  ELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS  Activities for Veterans Day (Cont.) Introduction of Guests -- Dignitaries selected as special guests may include local government officials, school alumni with distinguished military service, veterans from the community who represent different periods of service, and faculty members who are veterans. Principal Speaker -- Your principal speaker should be invited far enough in advance to allow adequate preparation for your program. Student Essay or Reading -- In school programs, student body participation may be increased by including in the program various presentations by individual pupils. Selected essays from school-wide competition may be offered by the student author. A reading of a well-known patriotic address by an American president or famous military hero by a talented student can be effective. There are a number of published musicals/narratives which could add greatly to your program. Moment of Silence, Taps -- While Veterans Day is primarily a tribute to America's living veterans, and should be observed more as a celebration than as a somber remembrance, it is always appropriate to include a moment of respect for those who gave their lives for their country. The signing of the World War I Armistice took place in a railway coach near the battle zone in France. The bugles sounded ""cease firing"" and the hostilities ended, marking a most significant moment in world history. Although 11 a.m. remains a traditional hour for this type of tribute, a moment of silence is appropriate at any point in the program. This may be followed by a rendition of ""Taps."" Closing -- The Master of Ceremonies announces ""Retire the Colors."" Accompanied by appropriate music, such as a John Philip Sousa march, the colors are paraded out of the assembly area, concluding the ceremony. 2. Flag-Raising Ceremony Weather permitting, outdoor flag-raising ceremonies permit group participation in an event that is often performed without notice. Such a ceremony, although brief, should include the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the National Anthem. A special guest may be invited to participate. 3. Musical Programs Veterans Day offers an excellent opportunity for school or community musical organizations to display their talents. A midday concert at the school or at a central location in the community may be especially dedicated to Veterans Day. An innovative program might include selections known to have been popular during America's wars. 4. Poster Contest The creative talents of students can be encouraged through participation in a school-wide Veterans Day poster contest. Winners should be appropriately recognized and awarded certificates. Local newspapers should be invited to photograph the winning entries. 5. School Newspaper Activities Veterans Day stories can be featured in school publications. Publish a roster of faculty members who are veterans. Describe Veterans Day activities being held in classrooms throughout the school. 6. Library Activities School or community libraries can prepare lists of recommended reading material suitable for Veterans Day. An appropriate display of book jackets or a special shelf containing selected publications can be used to call attention to the project. 7. Patriotic Groups Local veterans, historical or other patriotic organizations may enliven Veterans Day programs by   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Activities for Veterans Day (Cont.) providing period-uniformed flag bearers, fife and drum corps, and other marching and musical units. These organizations may also provide speakers with unique military experiences to share. 8. The Department of Veterans Affairs Local VA facilities -- medical centers, regional benefits offices and national cemeteries -- can serve as sources of information and speakers for Veterans Day programs. They can also provide contact with local veterans service organizations and arrange visits, tours and other special programs for students. To contact your local VA facilities, look under Department of Veterans Affairs in the Federal Government listings in the local telephone directory. 9. Classroom Activities Veterans Day themes can be included in writing assignments. First-person accounts of military service of a relative or friend can help develop narrative skills. Assign students to investigate the various benefits offered to veterans by government agencies. Write about veterans who are receiving educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Describe various veterans memorials which may be located nearby. The colorful and varied uniforms worn by members of the armed forces throughout our history offer students of all ages ideal subjects to draw and paint. Elementary-school children enjoy opportunities to create and exhibit costume items. Making colored construction paper hats representing various military eras is a modest and effective way of interesting pupils in Veterans Day subjects. Ask students to research and list all their known relatives who served in the Armed Forces. Since nearly 30 percent of the United States population are veterans, their dependents and survivors, most students should be able to contribute something.

Satellites operated by the Commerce              Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration              ( NOAA ) and by the Russian government,              detected a distress signal from the fishing vessel  Ranger .              The Coast Guard received an Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio              Beacon ( EPIRB )              distress alert from the 107-foot vessel homeported in Port Elizabeth,              N.J. The alert started a search and rescue mission that used five              rescue planes and helicopters from Coast Guard units in three states              to rescue the seven men.              Rescue              planes and helicopters from  Coast              Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C. , a rescue plane from Coast              Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., as well as two helicopters from              Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City all were involved with the rescue              which took place in the early morning hours 80 miles east of Atlantic              City.              Arriving              at the  Ranger , the rescue crew hoisted five fishermen to              the safety of the helicopter. A Coast Guard rescue swimmer stayed              behind in the life raft with two remaining fisherman in the 10-15              foot seas and 25 mph winds awaiting rescue from a second Coast Guard              rescue helicopter. The rescue swimmer and the two remaining fisherman              were rescued about 45 minutes later. All the fishermen were taken              back to Coast Guard Group Air Station Atlantic City and met by awaiting              ambulance and EMS from Atlantic City International Airport. Six of              the seven were released with one going to a local hospital.              “These              fishermen helped us save their lives. The EPIRB told us where to search,              survival suits kept them warm and their life raft kept them out of              the frigid water until our people could get them to safety,”              said Captain Bob Durfey, commanding officer of Coast Guard Group Air-Station              Atlantic City.              The Coast Guard strongly recommends having              charts, a global positioning device and reliable means of communication              on board. It is critically important that mariners rely on a VHF-FM              radio and EPIRBs as their primary means of communicating a distress.                           “This              particular rescue once again demonstrates the effectiveness of the               Copas-Sarsat System  and              NOAA’s commitment to protecting lives and property,” said              retired Navy Vice Admiral  Conrad              C. Lautenbacher , Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans              and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. “Truly, Cospas-Sarsat              works to take the ‘search’ out of search and rescue.”             The              Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary              and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels              and aircraft in distress. NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite,              Data, and Information Service ( NOAA              Satellite and Information Service ) represents the United States              in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment,              and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center.             NOAA’s              Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites ( GOES )              can instantly detect emergency signals. The  polar-orbiting              satellites  in the system detect emergency signals as they circle              the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the  U.S.              Mission Control Center  at NOAA’s facility in Suitland, Md.,              then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there              are 35 countries participating in the system.             NOAA’s              National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service ( NOAA              Satellites and Information ) is the nation’s primary source              of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellites and              Information operates the nation's environmental satellites, which              are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring and other environmental              applications such as fire detection, ozone monitoring and sea surface              temperature measurements.              NOAA              Satellites and Information also operates three  data              centers , which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography,              solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial              physics, and paleoclimatology.

GX135-68-9294472	Congressman Jim Kolbe   5 TH  DISTRICT ARIZONA   PRESS RELEASE                   December 19, 2000                   Here’s a Switch: Medals Pinned on a Trophy Mogul                   (Tucson)  --  Morton K. Tuller, 79, a Tucsonan and veteran of World War II, was awarded nine combat medals, some 55 years overdue, at ceremonies presided over by Rep. Jim Kolbe on Tuesday, Dec. 19.  Tuller was awarded a total of nine silver and bronze stars for service in the Asiatic Pacific; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign; and the Philippine Liberation movement. The ceremony was held at Tuller Trophy Factory, 525 N. 6th Ave.  A native of Brooklyn, New York, Tuller served as a cryptographer and performed message deciphering and decoding duties. He enlisted in the Army in August of 1942, entered active service in February of the following year and was discharged in January of 1946. Despite enlisting in the Army, Tuller spent much of his time in the service aboard Navy ships.  Tuller grew up in Chicago. When he was in high school, Tuller auditioned for a part in “The Dead End Kids,” and wound up in a touring company that criss-crossed the United States. He is well-known throughout Southern Arizona for volunteer efforts on behalf of Tucson Medical Center and Saguaro National Park.   Tuller moved to Tucson in 1947 and, after a stint in the jewelry business in Tucson and Los Angeles, opened Tuller Trophy in 1955 on East Broadway near Scott Avenue, across from the Westerner Hotel. (A picture taken in 1953 of Tuller and his wife, Sylvia, now deceased, appears on the mural on the Broadway underpass in downtown Tucson.)  The shop moved to N. 6th Avenue location in 1966. A second location at 5631 E. 22nd Street opened in 1974. Tuller continues to play an active role in the business, though day-to-day management is in the hands of his son, Howard. Tuller said he had “no particular interest” in seeking medals he deserved until he joined a bagpipe band and was informed that he should wear war medals on his outfit. Two years ago, he started querying the government record center in St. Louis, Mo. When those requests went unanswered, he mentioned the matter to Rep. Kolbe at a Friends of Saguaro National Park gathering.                   Home| Press Releases

More than 100 lives are saved each year through                 CAP search and rescue efforts.                                 Disaster Relief                CAP volunteers are often the first on the scene when disaster                 strikes. CAP provides air and ground transportation, and an                 extensive communication network to local, state, and national                 disaster relief agencies.                                 Humanitarian Relief                CAP transports time-sensitive medical materials in support of                 humanitarian organizations such as the American Red Cross. CAP's                 live organ transport program is credited with saving an average                 of 10 lives every year.                                 Counterdrug Operations                Through agreements with the US Air Force, US Customs Service,                 the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the US Forest Service, CAP                 provides aerial reconnaissance, airborne communications support,                 and airlift support of law enforcement personnel.

Civil Air                 Patrol cadets receive training in a broad spectrum of aviation                 and space topics with an emphasis on career exploration. Cadets                 also receive a series of orientation flights which provide an                 introduction to aircraft operation.                                 External                Each year, CAP supports over 200 workshops for educators at                 colleges and universities across the country, preparing                 approximately 5,000 educators to teach aerospace-related                 subjects. CAP annually develops and publishes curricula and                 other aerospace education materials to be used in the nation's                 schools. Each year, CAP sponsors the National Congress on                 Aviation and Space Education, the premier national convention                 for aerospace educators.                                                                         Cadet Program              The goal of the Cadet Program is to develop the potential of young             persons through physical fitness, ethics and leadership training,             and aerospace education.                                               Aerospace Education                Most cadets join because of an interest in aviation. In                 addition to the self-paced aerospace curriculum that cadets                 study, CAP offers flight orientation rides and even flight                 training opportunities for cadets.                                 Leadership Training                CAP cadets receive unique leadership and management training                 that can can be used later in any career field.                  Some cadets join CAP because they have an interest in the Air                 Force. Ten percent of all students now enrolled in the Air Force                 Academy are former CAP cadets. Cadets who earn the CAP Mitchell                 Award are eligible to enlist in the Air Force at a higher pay                 grade.                                 Emergency Services Education and Community Service                CAP cadets train and work alongside CAP senior members and are                 an important part of CAP's emergency services team.                                          CAP operates the world's largest fleet of civilian aircraft, with             CAP pilots flying nearly 130,000 hours each year.
GX030-89-11609923	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                      Plan of Action      On the evening of June 21 General Terry gathered his principal subordinates in the cabin of the  Far West,  moored to the bank of the Yellowstone at the mouth of the Rosebud, and worked out the details of a strategy that had already formed in his mind for snaring the Indians whose trail Reno had seen in the Rosebud Valley. Two fundamental assumptions shaped this plan: that the enemy probably numbered less than a thousand warriors, and that unless surrounded and forced into battle they would flee to the mountains as soon as they discovered the approach of soldiers. Although General Crook had learned that Sioux strength and will to fight had been grossly underestimated, word of his recent setback had not yet reached Terry. Terry's information indicated that the hostile camp almost certainly lay somewhere in the Little Bighorn Valley. By maneuvering Custer into position on one side and Gibbon on the other, he hoped to box in the Indians and force them into battle. Accordingly, Custer would lead his regiment up the Rosebud, cross to the Little Bighorn, and drop down that stream from the south; Gibbon, accompanied by Terry and his staff, would march back up the Yellowstone, ferry to the south bank, ascend the Bighorn, and enter the Little Bighorn Valley from the north.    Although recognizing that uncertainties of terrain and enemy location would prevent close cooperation, Terry hoped that no action would be precipitated before June 26—the earliest day Gibbon's foot soldiers could reach the objective. To afford Gibbon the needed time and to satisfy himself that the quarry had not slipped out of the trap to the southeast, Terry intended for Custer to continue up the Rosebud beyond the point where the hostile trail turned west and not veer toward the Little Bighorn until he had passed the head of the Rosebud.    Terry fully understood that Custer's cavalry, with no infantry to hold it back, enjoyed a much better chance of striking a blow than did Gibbon. For this reason he let Custer have six of Gibbon's Crow Indian scouts, who knew the country better than the Arikaras, and also offered to send along Gibbon's battalion of the 2d Cavalry under Maj. James Brisbin, as well as the Gatling gun battery. Custer gratefully accepted the scouts but declined the additional cavalry and the artillery. The Gatlings, he said in truth, would slow his march; Brisbin's cavalry, he explained less plausibly, would not enable him to overcome any opposition that the 7th alone could not cope with.    The next morning, June 22, Terry outlined his views to Custer in writing. Before sketching in general terms the troop movements that had been decided upon, the general noted the impossibility of giving definite instructions, and he professed, anyway, to repose too much confidence in his subordinate's ""zeal, energy, and ability"" to attempt to lay down detailed orders ""which might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy."" Custer should conform to Terry's views, therefore, unless he saw ""sufficient reason for departing from them."" Depart from them he did. Whether sufficient reason existed has ever since been a topic of heated controversy.

At the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture.        Computation of periods for half-staffing:      When the number of days is specified :        The day of death counts as the first day, even if the flags were not placed at     half-staff that day because death occurred after the normal time to lower the flags for     the day or notification was received too late to half-staff on that day.                The flags must be flown each day for the specified days, even if they would not     normally be flown on some of the days. This policy is applicable only if operating     personnel normally scheduled to work are available to perform this function.        On the death and on the following day :       If notification of death is received before the normal time to lower the flags for the day, the flags will be lowered to half-staff on that day and flown at half-staff on the following day.        If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the     flags are flown at half-staff only on the day following death.               If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the     flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on the following day. However, if     notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the flags     are flown at half- staff only on the following day.        From the day of death until interment :      If notification of death is received before the time the flags are normally lowered for the day, the flags must be lowered to half staff on that day. The flags will also be flown at half-staff on each succeeding day, including the day of interment.        If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the     flags must be flown at half-staff beginning the following day and on each succeeding day     through the day of interment.               If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the     flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on each succeeding day, including the     day of internment. If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day     of death, above instructions for the “day of death and the following day,” under     “Computation of periods for half-staffing,” apply.          Coincident occasions to half-staff :      If during a period when the flags are already at half-staff, notification of another death is received, the half-staff period will run concurrently, not consecutively.             6.    Procedures for Half-Staffing the U.S. Flag        CD/RL/LC.  If appropriate, submit request to the AD for approval to display the flags of the United States at half-staff to address local observances.      AD.

Only excerpts pertinent to REE have been quoted.          Display and Use of Flag by Civilians; Codification of Rules and Customs; Definition     (36 U.S.C. 173)            The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use     of the flag of the United States of America is established for use by such civilians or     civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations     promulgated by one or more executive departments of the United States. The flag of the     United States of America, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be defined according to     Sections 1 and 2 of Title 4, United States Code, and Executive Order 10824, issued     pursuant thereto.               Time and Occasions for Display; Hoisting and Lowering (36 U.S.C. 173)                     It is the universal custom to display the flag from sunrise to sunset on buildings and         on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the         flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.                           The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.                           The flag should not be displayed on days when weather is inclement, except when an all         weather flag is displayed.                           The flag should be displayed on all days, especially on: New Year's Day, January 1; Dr.         Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, third Monday in January; Inauguration Day, January 20;         Lincoln's Birthday, February 12; Washington's Birthday, third Monday in February; Easter         Sunday (variable); Mother's Day, second Sunday in May; Armed Forces Day, third Saturday in         May; Memorial Day (half-staff until noon), the last Monday in May; Flag Day, June 14;         Independence Day, July 4; Labor Day, first Monday in September; Constitution Day,         September 17; Columbus Day, second Monday in October; Navy Day, October 27; Veteran's Day,         November 11; Thanksgiving Day, fourth Thursday in November; Christmas Day, December 25;         and such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the United States; the         birthday of States (date of admission); and on State holidays.                           The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every         public institution.                                 Position and Manner of Display (36 U.S.C. 175)            The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags, should be either on the     marching right; that is, the flag's own right, or if there is a line of other flags, in     front of the center of that line.                     The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against         a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff         should be in front of the staff of the other flag.                           The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest         point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies         are grouped and displayed from staffs.                           When the flags of States, cities or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on         the same halyard with the flag of the United States of America, the latter should always         be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United         States of America should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be         placed above the flag of the United States of America or to the right of the flag of the         United States of America.                           When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate         staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International         usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time         of peace.                           When the flag of the United States of America is displayed from a staff projecting         horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the         union or blue field of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag         is at half-staff.                            When displaying either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union or blue         field should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.                            When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed         above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public         auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior         prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at                 the clergy's or speaker's right as he/she         faces the audience. Any other flag or display should be placed on the left of the         clergyman or speaker or at the right of the audience.                           The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statue or         monument, but it should never be used as the covering for the statue or monument.                           The flag, when directed by an Agency Head to fly at half-staff, must meet the following         provisions:                    (1)        The flag will fly at half-staff for a         period not to exceed 1 day.                    (2)        Flying the flag at half-staff         symbolizes respect to the memory of a USDA   individual(s) who died in the line         of duty or the loss of life of a local individual(s) through an act of heroism.                    (3)        The lowering of the flag to half-staff         can only be done in USDA controlled buildings or facilities.                    (4)        In a multi-tenant building complex or         facility, the lead agency must agree to fly the flag at half-staff.                           The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant         and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak         before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at         half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. By order of the         President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of         the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a         mark of respect to the memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign         dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential         instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not         inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the         Government of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of         that State, territory, or possession may proclaim that the flag of the United States of         America shall be flown at half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from         the death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the death of the Vice         President, the Chief Justice or retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker         of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an associate         Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive department, a former Vice         President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death         and the following day for a Member of Congress.                    As used in this subsection,                    (1)        the term “half-staff” means         the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of         the staff;                    (2)        the term “executive or military         department” means any agency listed under sections 101 and 102 of Title 5, United         States Code; and                     (3)        the term “Member of Congress”         means a Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or a Resident Commissioner from Puerto         Rico.                                 Respect of the Flag (36 U.S.C. 176)            No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should     not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags , and organization or     institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.                     The flag shall never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or         merchandise.                           The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to         permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.                           The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for         display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.                                 Conduct During Hoisting, Lowering or Passing of the Flag (36 U.S.C. 177)            During the ceremony of hoisting of or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a     parade or in a review, all persons present except those in uniform should face the flag     and stand at attention with the right hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should     render the military salute. When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with     their right hand and hold it at left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Aliens     should stand at attention. The salute to the flag in a moving column should be rendered at     the moment the flag passes.               Modification of Rules and Customs by President (36 U.S.C. 178)            Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of the flag or the United States of America,     set forth in section 171 to 178 or Title 36, United States Code, may be altered, modified,     or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be prescribed, by the Commander     in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, whenever he deems it to be appropriate     or desirable and any such alteration or additional rule shall be set forth in a     proclamation.

GX030-89-15443606	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                   Chief Gall.      March to the Little Bighorn      At noon on June 22 the 7th Cavalry passed in review for Terry and, behind the buckskin-clad Custer, began the march up the Rosebud. The column numbered 31 officers and about 585 en listed men, 40 Indian scouts, and nearly 20 packers, guides, and other civilian employees. Each trooper carried 100 cartridges for his carbine and 24 for his pistol, and a mule packtrain trans ported another 50 rounds of carbine ammunition per man together with rations and forage for 15 days.    Amid clouds of choking dust, Custer's column pushed up the Rosebud. On the 23d it struck the hostile trail, which through out the afternoon and all next day grew rapidly fresher and larger. In the broad trail and the proliferation of abandoned campsites, the Crow and Arikara scouts saw evidence of a great many more Indians than Custer and his officers suspected—perhaps several thousand—and they made no secret of their misgivings over being drawn into a fight with such an array. Although Custer thought the scouts inclined to exaggerate, he had raised his own estimate of enemy strength to 1,500 warriors, a force he judged his regiment well able to handle. A different fear gripped him, as it had everyone from the beginning of the campaign—that the Sioux would escape if given a chance. Impelled by this likelihood, he pushed the column hard—from 12 miles on the 22d to 30 each on the 23d and 24th. By the evening of the 24th, he had reached the point where the trail bent to the west and ascended the divide between the Rosebud and Little Bighorn Valleys. Indian ""sign"" left little doubt that the Sioux village lay just over the mountains.    Here Custer made a crucial decision. Instead of continuing up the Rosebud as Terry desired, he would follow the trail nearly to the summit of the divide, spend the 25th resting his exhausted command and fixing the location of the hostile camp, then hit it with a dawn attack on the 26th, the date appointed for Gibbon to reach the mouth of the Little Bighorn.        Custer Divides the Seventh Cavalry into Three Battalions.  (click on image for an enlargement in a new window)    A night march, adding 10 miles to the 30 already covered during the day, carried the regiment nearly to the summit. At the same time, Lt. Charles A. Varnum and several of his scouts climbed a high hill to the south, known as the Crow's Nest, and at dawn scanned the wrinkled landscape stretching off to the Bighorn Mountains. Some 15 miles to the west, where a thread of green traced the course of the Little Bighorn, the Crows discerned smoke rising from the Sioux village and on the benchland beyond a vast undulating mass that represented the Sioux pony herd. Lieutenant Varnum could not see these things, and neither could Custer when he arrived in response to a message from the lieutenant.    Although doubting that his scouts had actually detected the village, Custer knew it could not be far off. Moreover, his worst fears at once seemed confirmed, for two small parties of Sioux were spotted during the morning. Unquestionably, the regiment had now been discovered. If action were delayed until the 26th as planned, there would probably be no Indians to attack. And so Custer made his second crucial decision—to find the village and strike it as soon as possible.    For his decisions on the evening of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, Custer's detractors, pointing to his burning pride in the 7th Cavalry and his reputation as an impetuous commander, have charged him with willful disobedience of orders springing from a blind determination to win all the glory. He failed to meet Terry's desire that he continue up the Rosebud beyond the point where the Indian trail left it before turning to the Little Bighorn, then rushed his exhausted command into battle a day early and without first ascertaining the location and strength of the enemy.    Custer's defenders have replied that Terry's instructions were not binding, that the hostile trail clearly revealed that the Sioux were so close that they could not possibly have slipped off to the southeast, and that to continue the march up the Rosebud would not only have been pointless but might have afforded them the opportunity to escape. Once the regiment had been discovered, moreover, there was no other proper decision than to attack, for the enemy could hardly have been expected to remain in place waiting until the soldiers found it convenient to fight.    A good case can be made for either point of view, and the imponderables insure that men will always arrive at different answers. The command decisions that brought on the Battle of the Little Bighorn will doubtless continue to form fascinating topics of debate.

GX030-89-9165736	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                 IV. A Participant's Account of Major Reno's Battle      One of the more literate members of Major Reno's battalion was John M. Ryan, first sergeant of Capt. Thomas H. French's Company M. This extract from his recollections appeared in the  Hardin  (Mont.)  Tribune,  June 22, 1923:    Reno's battalion started down the valley, first on a trot, and then at a gallop, marching in columns of twos. Lieutenant Varnum, a very brave young officer in command of the scouts, rode ahead of Reno's battalion. He swung his hat around in the air, and sung one to the men, ""Thirty days' furlough to the man who gets the first scalp."" We were very anxious for the furlough, but not so particular about the scalp.    We arrived at the bank of the Little Beg Horn river and waded to the other side, and here there was a very strong current, and there was quicksand about three feet deep. On the other side of the river we made a short halt, dismounted, tightened our saddle girths, and then swung into our saddles. After mounting we came up, ""Left front into line,"" Captain French's Company M on the right and Lieutenant McIntosh's company on the left, and Captain Moylan's in the rear.    We were then in the valley of the Little Big Horn, and facing down stream. We started down on a trot and then one a slow gallop. Between the right of my company and the river bank there was quite a lot of underbrush, and bullberry bushes. Captain French gave me orders to take 10 men off to the right of my company and form a skirmish, line, so as to cover the brush from the right of our line to the river bank, as the Indians might be lurking there. We advanced in that formation from one and a half to two miles, until we came to a heavy piece of timber.    Hears First Shot    Before we arrived at the timber, there was one shot fired away ahead of us. I did not know whether it was fired by Lieutenant Varnum's scouts or one of the hostile Indians. That was the first shot that I heard in the opening of the battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876, and I had pretty good ears about that time.    Private James Turley of my troop when we arrived at the timber and had orders to halt, could not control his horse which carried him towards the Indian camp. That was the last I saw of him. He was a very nice young man. A little incident happened a day our two before we left Fort Rice to go on the expedition. Turley asked me if I would allow him to put some of his property in my clothes chest. I told him that I would with the understanding that if he was killed the contents of the chest would belong to me and if I was killed it would belong to him. After coming back from the expedition the property belonging to those men that were killed was sold at public auction and the proceeds turned over to the paymaster.    When we got to the timber we rode down an embankment and dismounted. This was where the channel of the river changed and was probably several feet lower than the level of the prairie. We dismounted in haste, number four of each set of four holding the horses.    We came up onto higher ground forming a skirmish line from the timber towards the bluffs on the other side of the valley and facing down stream in the direction of the Indian camp. This was our first view of the Indian camp from the skirmish line. Some of the men laid down while others knelt down.    At this particular place there was a prairiedog town and we used the mounds for temporary breast e works. We got the skirmish line formed and here the Indians made their first charge. There were probably 500 of them coming from the direction of their village. They were well mounted and well armed. They tried to cut through our skirmish line. We fired volleys into them repulsing their charge and emptying a number of their saddles.    Lieutenant Hodgson walked up and down the line encouraging the men to keep cool and fire low.    First Man Killed    Finally when they could not cut through us, they strung out in a single file, lying on the opposite side of their ponies from us, and then they commenced to circle. They overlapped our skirmish line on the left and were closing in on the rear to complete the circle. We had orders to fall back to our horses. This was where the first man was killed, Sergt. Miles F. O'Hara of my troop M. He was a corporal going out on the expedition and promoted to a sergeant a few days before his death to replace Sergt. John Dolane, who was discharged, as his term of service had expired, and was back with, the wagon trains at Powder river. Sergeant O'Hara was considered a very fine soldier in M troop and we missed him very much.    In the Indian camp after the battle, when we were destroying it, we found the heads of three of our men tied together with wires and suspended from a lodge pole with their hair all burned off. We did not see their bodies there. The Indians probably threw them into the river. We got back to our horses and the orders were given to mount and this time some of the men became confused and some of them could not fined their horses.    Major Reno had lost his hat and had a red handkerchief tied around his head. As we mounted I looked to the rear in the direction of the river and saw the Indians completing the circle, riding through the brush and lying flat on their ponies. I mentioned the fact to Captain French, saying: ""Captain, the Indians are in our rear."" He answered: ""Oh, no; those are General Custers' men."" Just at that moment one of those Indians fired and Private George Lorentz of my company, who was number one of the first set of fours, was shot, the bullet striking him in the back of his neck and coming out of his mouth. He fell forward on his saddle and dropped to the ground. Just at that moment the Indians fired into us from all sides, and I said to Captain French of my company: ""The best thing that we can do is to cut right through them."" By this time they had us surrounded. They were on higher ground than we were. Major Reno rode up and said: ""Any of you men who wish to make your escape, follow me.""    Reno Leads Charge    The order was then given to charge, and away we went up the steep embankment, cutting through the Indians in a solid body, Major Reno being in advance. As we cut through them the fighting was hand to hand, and it was death to any man who fell from his horse, or was wounded and was not able to keep up with the command. After cutting through we went back over the same ground, and took a circle to the left to gain the bluffs at the nearest point. Here there was some pretty sharp fighting. The Indians were in great numbers on all sides of us. In this charge there were 30 men killed, my company losing 10, but we reached the river.    Bloody Knife, chief of Indian scouts; Charlie Reynolds, a white scout, and Izar Dorman, the negro interpreter, were killed here. Lieutenant Hodgson was wounded, and had his horse shot, and Lieut. Donald Mcintosh was killed. Mcintosh was a brave and faithful officer, commanding Company G.    Lieutenant DeRudio and Fred Girard, a white scout, and some 10 or 12 men became separated from the command and hid themselves in the brush or in the woods, or under the river embankment, and some of those men told me afterwards that they stood in water up to their necks, under the embankment, to keep out of sight of the Indians. Two of those men were sergeants of my company, Charles White and Patrick Carney. They joined the command in the intrenchments on the bluff after dark.    At this point the river was about 50 yards wide, and the water about two and a half feet deep, with a swift current. Lieutenant Hodgson asked one of the men to carry him across, he being wounded and his horse being shot. It was reported that a trumpeter from my company named Fisher, better known as ""Bounce,"" told him to hold on to his stirrup, and the horse drew the lieutenant as well as the rider across the river. He was shot a second time and killed. Now I know of three men who claim to have aided Hodgson.    Fighting is Desperate    The opposite bank of the river was very steep, and the only way to get up to the bluffs was through a buffalo trail worn on the bank, and only wide enough to let one man pass through at a time. Before we crossed the river the fighting was desperate and at close quarters.    In many instances the soldiers would empty their revolvers right into the breasts of the Indians, and after these were empty some were seen to throw them away, and grab their carbines, not having time to return their revolvers to their holsters. In my opinion, if Reno had remained in the timber a short time longer not a man would have made his escape as the Indians outunumbered us 10 to one.    In scaling the bluff Dr. DeWolf, a contract surgeon on the expedition, was killed; also Sergeant Clair of Company K, William D. Myer, a farrier of company M, and Henry Gordono of the same company. Their bodies, with a number of others, lay under cover of our guns, so that the Indians did not get a chance to scalp them.    After we gained the bluffs we could look back upon the plains where the Indians were, and could see them stripping and scalping our men, and mutilating their bodies in a horrible manner. The prairie was all afire. The officers did all in their power to rally the men, and while they were doing so many were killed.    After the companies were formed the firing ceased, and we were joined by Benteen's battalion, which was the first we had seen of him since the division of the regiment. Soon after, the pack train arrived, with Company B, under Captain McDougall, which was very fortunate, as our ammunition was nearly exhausted, and we could not get supplies from any other source. We had several wounded men and we attended to them as well as circumstances would permit. I understood at that time that Captain Weir with his company D, left the command there, and started in the direction General Custer took for a short distance, and theme returned, although I did not see him.    Leaving two companies with the packs and wounded, Major Reno, with five companies, or what was left of them, proceeded in the direction we had supposed General Custer took, and in the direction of the Indian camp.    We went in that direction for probably half a mile until we gained a high point and could overlook the Indian camp and the battlefield. We saw at a distance of from a mile and a half to two miles parties whom we supposed were Indians, riding back and forth, firing scattering shots. We thought that they were disposing of Custer's wounded men, and this afterward proved to be true.    We halted for a few moments, and saw a large herd of ponies at the further end of the village, and could distinguish a large party of Indians coming towards the Indian camp. The prairie around the village and the first battlefield was all afire, having been set by the Indians to hide their movements.    At the top of this bluff we halted, and at foot there was a ford, and this was where Custer had first encountered the Indians, as we found some of the dead bodies there two days afterwards. While we were on the bluffs the Indians again made their appearance, coming in large numbers from the direction in which we heard the firing. We exchanged several shots with them, and we lost a few men, and then had orders to fall back to our packs and wounded.    On our arriving there we dismounted in haste, putting the wounded in a low depression on the bluffs and put packs from the mules around them to shelter them from the fire of the Indians. We then formed a circle of our pack mules and horses, forming a skirmish line all around the hole, and then lay down amid waited for the Indians.    Indians Surround Them    We had been in this position but a short time when they advanced in great numbers from the direction in which we came.    They made several charges upon us and we repulsed them every time. Finally they surrounded us. Soon the firing became general all along the line, very rapid and at close range. The company on the right of my company had a number of men killed in a few minutes. There was a high ridge on the right and an opening on the right of our lines, and one Indian in particular I must give credit for being a good shot.    While we were lying in this line he fired a shot and killed the fourth man on my right. Soon afterward he fired again and shot the third man. His third shot wounded the man on my right, who jumped back from the line, and down among the rest of the wounded. I thought my turn was coming next. I jumped up, with Captain French, and some half a dozen members of my company, and, instead of firing straight to the front, as we had been doing up to the time of this incident, we wheeled to our right and put in a deadly volley, and I think we put an end to that Indian, as there were no more men killed at that particular spot.    Captain French was as brave an officer as ever served in the Seventh Cavalry, and was known to have killed several Indians on different occasions. He had a Springfield rifle, caliber .50, breechloader, and it was his custom, whenever he shot an Indian, to cut a notch in the stock of that gun.    I remember on one occasion he fired at a curlew, two or three shots, and did not hit it. He felt so discouraged that he took the gun and threw it away. A little later I picked it up and rolled it up in a blanket, put it in one of the government wagons, and brought it into Fort Rice, Dakota, after the expedition broke up, unknown to him, and when he learned that I had it he reclaimed it. He retired from the service some years afterwards, and I have been informed, I am sorry to say, he meet with a fatal accident.    When dark set in, it closed the engagement on the twenty-fifth. We went to work with what tools we had, consisting of two spades, our knives and tin coups, and, in fact, we used pieces of hard tack boxes for spades, and commenced throwing up temporary works. We also formed breastworks from boxes of hard bread, sacks of bacon, sacks of corn and oats, blankets, and in fact everything that we could get hold of.    During the night ammunition and the rations reached us where we were entrenched in the lines, but we suffered severely from lack of water. Although the river was only three or four hundred yards away, we were unable to get any water, as the Indians held the approach to it. During the night several men made attempts to get e water, but they were killed or driven back.    About the middle of the night we heard a trumpet call, and the men commenced to cheer, thinking it was Custer's men who were coming to our assistance. Major Reno ordered one of our trumpeters to sound a call, but it was not repeated, so we made up our minds that it was a decoy on the part of the Indians to get us out of our works.    Benteen Hard Pressed    The trumpet that they used probably belonged to one of Custer's trumpeters, but we did not know it at that time. We had no thought of leaving our works, as we head a number of our men wounded there, and some of them pretty badly.    At intervals during the night we could hear the Indians riding back and forth across the river. I have an idea that they thought we were going to make a rush and get out of there.    The next morning, being the 26th, two shots were fired just before daylight by the Indians, in rapid succession. All this time we were wondering what had become of Custer and his troops. This began the engagement of another day. In a few moments the battle raged in earnest, the Indians advancing in large numbers and trying to cut through.    Captain Benteen's company particularly was hard pressed, and the men did their utmost to repulse those Indians who were gaining ground on the troops. Captain Benteen called out to Major Reno for re-enforcements, saying: ""The Indians are doing their best to cut through my lines, and it will be impossible for me to hold my position much longer."" Captain French's Company M was immediately withdrawn from that part of the line which they occupied, and rushed to the assistance of Captain Benteen's company. Both companies made a charge on the Indians and drove them down the hill, but in doing so we lost a number of men. This section of the battlefield was a little higher than the balance of the ground.    Private Tanner Killed    Had the Indians been successful, the day would have been lost, and Reno's command would have shared the fate of Custer's brave men, as Captain Benteen said afterward.    Private James Tanner of Company M, was badly wounded in this charge, and his body lay one the side of the bluffs in an exposed position. There was a call for volunteers to bring him down, and I grabbed a blanket with three other men, rushed to his assistance, rolled him into the blanket, and made quick tracks in getting him from the side of the bluffs to where our wounded lay. Fortunately none of the rescuing party received anything more than a few balls through their clothing. After placing Tanner with the rest of the wounded, he died in a few minutes.    There was a gray horse belonging to my company, that was ridden by Captain French, and he was the best buffalo horse in the command. He was among the other horses near the wounded, and an Indian shot him through the head. He was staggering about among the other horses, and Private Henry C. Voyt, of my company took hold of him to lead him out of the way of the other horses, and Voyt at the same instant had his brains blown out. We buried Private Tanner, about whom I have made some explanation, and Voyt in the same grave the next morning. Then we made a head board out of a piece of hardtack box, and marked their names with a lead pencil one the board, and drove it in to the ground.    Indian Fire Slackens    Late in the day the fire of the Indians slackened, except on the point of a high bluff in the direction in which it was supposed that Custer had gone. Here the Indians put in a few well-directed shots that laid several of our men low. I do not know what kind of a gun one of those Indians used, but it made a tremendous noise, and, in fact those Indians were out of range of our carbine, which were Springfields, caliber .45. Captain French of my company asked me if I could do anything with, those Indians, as they were out of range of the carbines. I told the captain that I would try, and as I was the owner of a 15-pound Sharp's telescope rifle, caliber .45, which I had had made in Bismarck before the expedition started out, and which cost me $100. I fired a couple of shots until I got range of that group of Indians. Then I put in half a dozen shots in rapid succession, and those Indians scampered away from that point of the bluff and that ended the firing on the part of the Indians in that memorable engagement, and the boys set up quite a cheer.    The Indians all scampered from the bluffs across the river and moved back to their encampment. We could see them pulling down their lodges and getting ready for a hasty removal. In a short time they stripped the hides off their lodges and left the poles standing and moved out out from their camp up the valley of the Little Big Horn, and over the field where Major Reno's battalion fought in the beginning of the engagement, and where his dead lay. It was the largest body of Indians that I ever saw move together at one time.    I have seen the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes, the Kiowas, the Apaches, and the Comanches move together inn the Indian territory, and in Kansas years before, while campaigning there under General Custer, I should say that there were double the number moving out from this camp.    When they moved, the captain of my company, Thomas H. French, and I fired into them while they remained in range of our two guns, and those were the last shots fired in the battle of the Little Big Horn. That was well known by every man in Reno's battalion.    Major Reno, Captain French, Captain Benteen, Captain McDougall, Captain Weir, Lieutenant Godfrey and, in fact all of the officers did all that they could in order to defeat the Indians, and some of the officers must have had a charmed life the way they stood up under this heavy fire.    I think the Indians took some of our men prisoners, and when other reinforcements joined us we found what appeared to be human bones, and parts of blue uniforms, where the men had been tied to stakes and trees. Some of the bodies of our officers were not found, at least not at that time. Among them were Lieutenants Harrington, Porter and Sturgis. I understood that some parts of their clothing, uniform or gauntlet gloves were found on the field, which showed that they were killed. In burying the dead many of the bodies were not identified.    After the Indians moved out of sight we jumped out of our works, built better rifles pits, and unsaddled our horses, which had not been unsaddled since the evening of the twenty-fourth.    45 Men Killed    We also took the packs from the mules. Then we got water from the river in camp kettles, and made a better shelter for the horses and wounded, for we expected that the Indians would attack us again.    Reno's command lost, between the engagement in the bottom and the entrenchments on the bluffs, somewhere about 45 men killed and 60 wounded, which will show how desperate the engagement was. In my company, out of 45 men and horses that went into the engagement, 14 men and the second lieutenant were killed, 10 wounded, and we lost about 15 horses killed or disabled.    That night everything was quiet as far as the Indians were concerned. The next morning at daylight we could look from the bluffs over the timber to where the Indian camp was, and we saw that it was deserted, with the exception of the lodge poles, which remained standing. On the other side, a long way off from the Indian camp, we noticed a large cloud of dust arising, and a body of either Indians or troops coming towards the Indian camp, but at the time we could not distinguish which they were.    Some of the officers turned their field glasses on, and thought they were troops. Reno immediately dispatched a couple of his scouts, and it proved to be the balance of our expedition, and General Gibbon's command under General Alfred Terry. It appears that they came through Custer's battlefield, and they counted the dead bodies of 207 men. They then crossed the river.

Educated at the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point , Custer proved his brilliance and daring as a cavalry officer of the Union Army in the Civil War.  General George McClellan  appointed the twenty-three-year-old Custer as brigadier general in charge of a Michigan cavalry brigade. By 1864, Custer was leading the Third Cavalry Division in General Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign. Throughout the fall, the Union Army moved across the Valley, burning homes, mills, and fields of crops.           View of an American Indian Camp ,  Mathew Brady Studio,  between 1844 and 1860.

Custer's Division Retiring from Mount Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley,  October 7, 1864 ,  Alfred Waud, artist.   American Treasures of the Library of Congress    This sketch of Custer's division retiring from Mount Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley on October 7, 1864 is by Alfred Waud, a Civil War sketch artist who documented the war for the press. At a time when the shutter speed of cameras was not fast enough to capture action, the public's only glimpse of battle came from sketch artists. Waud routinely ventured dangerously close to the fighting. He portrays, more intimately than any other artist, the drama and horror of this country's most devastating conflict.         Tapped to pursue General Robert E. Lee's army as it fled from  Richmond , Custer himself received the Confederate flag of truce when Lee surrendered at  Appomattox Courthouse . At the end of the Civil War, he was commissioned to the western frontier as part of an Army campaign to impress and intimidate hostile Plains Indians with a show of U.S. military might.    After gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874, white miners flocked into territory ceded the Sioux less than ten years earlier. Although the second Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) clearly granted the tribe exclusive use of the Black Hills, in the winter of 1875, the U.S. ordered the Sioux to return to their reservation by the end of January. With many Indians out of communication range and many others hostile to the order, the U.S. Army prepared for battle.     On May 17, 1876, Lieutenant Colonel Custer led the 750 men of the 7th United States Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota Territory.  Commanded by Brigadier General Alfred H. Terry, Custer's division was part of an expedition intended to locate and rout tribes organized for resistance under Chief Sitting Bull.  Hoping to entrap Sitting Bull in the Little Big Horn area, Terry ordered Custer to follow the Rosebud River while he brought the majority of the men down the Yellowstone River. After meeting at the mouth of the Little Big Horn, they planned to force the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne back to their reservations.

Instead of waiting for Terry, the lieutenant colonel chose to wage an immediate attack. He divided his forces into several groups, and headed out.  Quickly encircled by their enemy, the five companies under Custer's immediate command were slaughtered in less than an hour. Over the next two days, the remnants of the 7th Cavalry fought for their lives as they waited in vain for Custer to relieve them. On June 27, the Indians retreated as reinforcements arrived.  Expecting to meet Custer and prepare for battle, General Terry discovered only the bodies of Custer and his men.     Nearly a third of the men of the 7th Cavalry, including Custer and his brother, died at Little Big Horn.  A stunning but short-lived victory for Native Americans, the Battle of Little Big Horn galvanized the public against the Indians. In response, federal troops poured into the Black Hills.    While many Native Americans surrendered to federal authorities, in 1877, Sitting Bull sought refuge in Canada.  Four years later, with his supporters on the brink of starvation, Sitting Bull returned to the U.S. and to life at Standing Rock Agency. There, he fought the sale of tribal lands under the  Dawes Severalty Act  and lived to participate in the  Ghost Dance  Movement--a cultural and religious revitalization among Native Americans.  Threatened by a religious awakening that promised the end of white dominance, federal authorities attempted to take custody of Sitting Bull in  1890 .  He was killed in the affray sparked by the attempted arrest.

Lane Evans (D-IL), the Ranking Democratic Member on the              House Committee on Veterans Affairs, a Florida firm has agreed to              keep jobs under a new VA property management contract in the United              States.  Evans, a strong supporter of Buy America, had opposed              award of the contract because the company, Ocwen Financial              Corporations, has become a leader in outsourcing American jobs to              low-paid employees in India.                Evans noted that after he brought the matter to              the attention of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony J.              Principi, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was able to obtain              from Ocwen a bilateral agreement declaring that it will not              outsource labor for VA property management services to India.               Further, Ocwen has also agreed to provide a right of first refusal              to displaced VA employees whom Ocwen determines are qualified for              jobs under the contract.  Nonetheless, even if offered jobs with              Ocwen, former federal employees will be required to relocate to              Florida and will have no guarantee that the wages and benefits              provided by Ocwen will be commensurate with those currently provided              by VA.                While I am pleased that the jobs under this              contract will not be outsourced to other countries, I find it              unacceptable that federal workers are being placed at competitive              disadvantage due to Ocwens use of low-paid Indian workers to              improve its bottom line, said Evans.  By providing government              contracts to companies that pride themselves on saving money by              moving jobs from the United States to developing countries, our              government sends a message that the bottom line for corporations is              more important than maintaining jobs for skilled American workers,              observed Evans.                Evans has a long history of supporting the              rights of American workers.  He persuaded the VA to obtain employee              uniforms made by American workers in Illinois rather than low-paid              workers in developing countries.  Evans questioned how can the              United States prosper if this government is willing to sacrifice              American jobs to improve corporate profits?  While outsourcing some              government work to American workers may be appropriate and              cost-effective, Evans strongly opposes placing federal workers at a              competitive disadvantage by corporate outsourcing to nations with              low wages.                -30-                                          Back to  Press Releases
