The Bluebird is 6 to 7 inches long and is a member of the Thrush family. Male Bluebirds are a pale sky blue over most of their body, darker on their back. Females are blue-grey with blue wings and tail, duller than the male. Juvenile birds have blue wings with the tail area duller than the adult male, a white eye ring and spotted underparts. Mountain Bluebirds live in open grasslands and nest in holes in trees, crevices and nesting boxes. They have a zig-zagging flight pattern that easily identifies them.                                   State Dance     The 1989 legislature designated the  square dance  as the American Folk Dance of Idaho. Two of the most commonly cited ancestors to modern square dance are the English Morris dance and the French Quadrille. It is the Quadrille that most point to as the grand-daddy of our modern square dance. One of the earliest records of this type of dance in America is contained in the works of John Playford, a musician and dancing master. His book, 'The English Dancing Master - Plaine and Easy Rules for the Dancing of Country Dances, with Tunes to Each Dance' was published in seventeen editions between 1650 and 1728 and contained 918 dances. As the pioneers moved westward, many of the dances were lost or forgotten, but many were preserved, particularly in the southern Appalachians where the running set established itself as one of the deep taproots of western square dance. The running set even had a caller -- America's only unique contribution to the square dance.                                Photo courtesy of:    Tom Davenport, Layton UT       State Fish    The  Cutthroat Trout  was designated the state fish by the 1990 legislature. The Cutthroat, along with the Rainbow and Bull Trout, is native to Idaho. The body color varies with the back ranging from steel gray to olive green. The sides may be yellow brown with red or pink along the belly. The Cutthroat name comes from the distinctive red to orange slash on the underside of its lower jaw. The scientific name for Cutthroat Trout,  Oncorhynchus clarki , is in reference to William Clark who first described in detail the Cutthroats of the Columbia River. His partner Meriwether Lewis earlier encountered Cutthroats near the great falls of Montana's Missouri River in July of 1805. Cutthroat species found in Idaho are the Westslope Cutthroat which is found in northern and central Idaho and the Yellowstone Cutthroat which is found in southeastern Idaho.                                  State Flag     A silk flag, with a blue field, 5 feet 6 inches fly, 4 feet 4 inches on pike is bordered by gilt fringe 2 inches wide, with the Great Seal of Idaho in the center. The words 'State of Idaho' are embroidered in gold block letters two inches high on a red band below the Great Seal. Adopted by the 1907 legislature.                                   State Flower     The  Syringa  ( Philadelphus lewisii ) was designated the state flower of Idaho by the legislature in 1931. The species name ' lewisii ' honors Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis & Clark expedition. Lewis wrote of the plant in his journal. It is a branching shrub growing 3 to 10 feet tall, with clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The blossoms are similar to the mock orange. It grows in open coniferous forests, at forest edge and in moist draws in drier regions providing good coverage for wildlife. Native Americans used its branches for bows, arrows and cradles.                                Photo courtesy of:    Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument       State Fossil    The 1988 legislature designated the Hagerman Horse Fossil as the official    state fossil. Discovered in 1928, it was originally described as Plesippus    shoshonensis. Subsequent research found the Hagerman horse to be the same    as a previously described species and it is now known as Equus simplicidens.    The Hagerman horse is the oldest known representative of the modern horse    genus Equus (includes horses, donkeys, and zebras) and is believed to be more    closely related to the living Grevy's zebra in Africa. The 3.5 million year    old sediments at the  Hagerman Fossil    Beds National Monument  contain the world's    richest known fossil deposits from the late Pliocene epoch. They have yielded    about 200 horse skeletons, 20 of which are complete. The more than 200 vertebrate,    invertebrate, and plant species preserved there represent the last vestiges    of animals that existed prior to the Ice Age and the earliest appearances    of modern flora and fauna.                                Photo courtesy of:    Danny L. Barney, Ph.D., University of Idaho       State Fruit    Several  huckleberry  species are native to Idaho, all belonging to genus  Vaccinium  section  Myrtillus . The most common and popular is the black or thin-leaved huckleberry ( Vaccinium membranaceum ). Plants grow slowly, taking up to 15 years to reach full maturity. Black huckleberries produce single plump, dark purple berries in the axils of leaves on new shoots. They depend on an insulating cover of snow for survival during winter and have not been successfully grown commercially. Black huckleberries grow at elevations between 2,000 and 11,000 feet with many productive colonies between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. Black huckleberries usually grow from 1 to 6 feet tall and produce berries up to 1/2 inch in diameter. Huckleberries are a favorite food of bears.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Stewart's Gem Shop, Boise       State Gem     Adopted by the 1967 legislature, the  Idaho Star Garnet  is known worldwide by collectors. Garnets are complex silicates, related to Quartz, and found almost exclusively in Idaho in Latah and Benewah counties. Star Garnets are a natural stone, not synthetically produced. Star Garnets are more rare than either Star Rubies or Star Sapphires. Normally the star in the Idaho Garnet has four rays, but occasionally one has six rays as in a Sapphire. The color is usually dark purple or plum and the star seems to glide or float across the dark surface. The star is caused by intrusions of the mineral rutile.                                Photo courtesy of:    Don Shugart & The Appaloosa Horse Club       State Horse     Historians believe the Nez Perce and Palouse tribes of Washington, Oregon and Idaho were the first tribes to breed horses for specific traits - intelligence, speed and endurance. White settlers call these horses 'Palouse horses.' Over time they came to be referred to as 'a Palousey' and the 'Appalousey.' During the Nez Perce War of 1877,  Appaloosa  horses helped the non-treaty Nez Perce, under the guidance of Chief Joseph, elude the U.S. Calvary for several months. The coloring of the Appaloosa coat is distinct in every individual horse and ranges from white blanketed hips to a full leopard. Adopted by the 1975 legislature.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Faye Sutherland, Boise       State Insect     The  Monarch Butterfly  ( Danaus plexippus ) was adopted as the state insect by the state legislature in 1992. Early settlers to North America from Europe, particularily those from Holland and England, named the butterfly 'Monarch,' after King William, Prince of Orange, stateholder of Holland and later named King of England. The monarchs' color suggested the name. The Monarch Butterfly is a great migrator, traveling many miles during its lifetime, which can be from a few weeks up to a year. Monarchs range in mass from .25 to .75 grams (a dime has a mass of 2.3 grams). Males are usually larger than females. Female Monarchs lay eggs on the underside of milkweed plants. The larvae then feed on the plants. Monarchs go through a complete metamorphosis in 3 to 6 weeks.                                            Photo courtesy of: The Peregrine Fund        Peregrine description excerpted            from The Peregrine Fund web site with permission.          State Raptor         The  Peregrine Falcon  ( Falco peregrinus ) was        adopted as the state raptor for Idaho by the legislature in 2004. The        scientific name comes from the Latin words falco, meaning hook-shaped        (falcate) and may refer to the beak or claws, and peregrinus, meaning        to wander. Peregrines have also been called Duck Hawk, Great-footed Hawk,        and Wandering Falcon. The Peregrine Falcon has a body length of 15 - 20        inches, a 3 1/2 foot wingspan, and weighs 1 1/4 - 2 3/4 pounds. The Peregrine        Falcon has one of the most global distributions of any bird of prey. This        falcon is found on every continent except Antarctica, and lives in a wide        variety of habitats from tropics, deserts, and maritime to the tundra,        and from sea level to 12,000 feet. Peregrines are highly migratory in        the northern part of their range.         Boise is home to the World Center for          Birds of Prey, The Peregrine Fund's world headquarters. Visit them on         the web at  www.peregrinefund.org  or         visit in person at the  Velma       Morrison Interpretive Center .                               State Seal     The Great Seal of the State, replica of which is embroidered in colors in the center of the flag, came into existence in 1891 by act of the first state legislature. The seal was designed by Emma Edwards Green, the only woman to design a state seal. The translation of the Latin motto on the seal, 'Esto Perpetua' is 'Let it be perpetual' or 'It is forever.' In 1957 the seal was updated and streamlined by Paul B. Evans. The official Great Seal can be seen in the office of the Secretary of State.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Idaho Forest Products Commission       State Tree     The  Western White Pine  ( Pinus Monticola pinaceae ), our state tree, is probably most notable since the largest remaining volume of this timber in the United States grows in the northern part of Idaho. White Pine has many fine qualities such as straight grain and soft even texture. Idaho’s state tree grows to 175 feet with a trunk diameter from 5 to 8 feet. The largest western white pine in the world stands 219 ft. high near Elk River, Idaho. Adopted by the 1935 legislature. According to the legislative bill, it was promoted by 'members of Ellen Wright Camp, Franklin County Chapter, Daughters of Pioneers.'                               Photo / description courtesy of:    Idaho Potato Commission       State Vegetable    Idaho's unique environment provides nearly perfect growing conditions for  potato es. The soil, water, clean air and climate in Idaho contribute to those consistently high-quality potatoes that have made Idaho famous for so many years. Idaho's rich volcanic soil is ideally suited for potatoes. Warm, sunny days, cool nights and water from melting snow in nearby mountains make the perfect combination for growing the world's best potatoes.

They are found only in the New World. People across North America attract them to their homes through hummingbird feeders and flowering gardens, and can be rewarded with bright migratory species, such as a male  Rufous Hummingbird  (left). Yet the true center of trochilid diversity is in the Neotropics, home to a dazzling array of species that range from tiny to surprisingly large, and with an assortment of head plumes, tail streamers, and bill shapes. Their ability to hover and fly backwards makes them unique. Further, their interdependence on and co-evolution with flowers provide a fascinating correlation and field for study. Because the sources of nectar are constantly changing as flowers bloom and fade, most hummingbirds live solitary lives, aggressively defending nectar sources from rivals. Despite the strong pressure to gather nectar rapidly, studies have shown that 70% of a hummer's time is spent doing little else than singing, self-preening, and sunbathing (Schuchmann 1999). In the two shots below, a male  White-necked Jacobin  sits near its favored feeder in Trinidad (below left) but immediately reacts when a White-chested Emerald tries to approach. Such interactions can lead to dramatic interspecific aerial chases.                                                                                                                    A male  Magnificent Hummingbird  sitting in the shade (below left) can look dark and dingy. But when the hummer sits in the sun, and turns its head (below right), the observer is suddenly dazzled by a flash of spectacular glittering color. This species ranges from the southwest United States to Panama, and is a big hit at feeders from Ramsey Canyon, Arizona, to Savegre, Costa Rica.                                                                                                                                                    Iridescent color among birds is one of nature's wonders, and hummingbirds display a full spectrum. For many species, iridescence is limited to a throat gorget, or a gorget and crown. North American examples include  Anna's Hummingbird , the resident species throughout much of California (below, top row left) and  Costa's Hummingbird  of the southwestern deserts (below, top row right). On others the entire body is jeweled with waves of color, like on  Violet Sabrewing  (bottom row, below).                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Neotropics are inhabited by a host of hummingbirds. Colorful species buzz about rainforest trees and visit flowers at timberline on Andean volcanoes. The Caribbean islands have their own fine assortment, including  Purple-throated Carib  (right), this one on Dominica. In my meanderings around the Neotropics, there have been many wonderful species, such as the Horned Sungem  Heliactin cornuta  recently seen in southern Brazil. Three species have particularly impressed me with their unbelievable beauty, and all have been in the western Andes of Colombia or northwestern Ecuador. I have photos of none of these, but nothing can beat a Velvet-purple Coronet  Boissonneaua jardini , or a Purple-backed Thornbill  Ramphomicron microrhynchum , or a Rainbow-bearded Thornbill  Chalcostigma herrani . Try to see one if you have the chance. The names of hummingbirds alone set one's head spinning: sunangels, comets, pufflegs, fairies, starfrontlets, brilliants, mountain-gems, coquettes ....                            Unusual beaks and strange tails are part of the world of tropical hummingbirds. The bill of  White-tipped Sicklebill  (below left) is adapted best for  Heliconia  flowers. By far the longest bill, proportionate to size, belongs to the ridiculously unbalanced  Sword-billed Hummingbird  (below right) of the high Andes. It is adapted for feeding on exceptionally long tubular flowers; this photo was taken at about 9000' in Peru by my friend Bob Tintle while we were birding together. The yellow on its throat is pollen.                                                                                                                                                                                           Hummingbirds range in size from the smallest birds on earth to several quite large species in the Andes. Between them, these hummers range in size from 2 to 8.5 inches, and in weight from 1.6 to 19 grams. Among the largest is  Great Sapphirewing  (left), shown here from the Peruvian Andes, and nearby lives the largest of them all,  Giant Hummingbird  Patagona gigas , the size of a swift.                 Among the smallest species are the woodstars and the coquettes. The two photos below show two Neotropical coquettes: a female  Tufted Coquette  (below left), taken in Trinidad, and a male  Black-crested Coquette  (below right), from Costa Rica.                                                                                                                                                                          Despite the many species of hummingbirds, they are divided into just two subfamilies (Schuchmann 1999). The Trochilinae include all the colorful species (nearly 300 in all) while the Phaethornithinae is composed of the six genera and 34 species of hermits. Brown, long-tailed hermits forage in the understory; some short-tailed species weigh only 1.6 gram (the same weight as the tiny Bee Hummingbird  Mellisuga helenae  of Cuba, often termed the ""world's smallest bird"").              All hermits that have been studied display in noisy leks, their clicking dominating a patch of jungle. Hermits often have a species affinity for  Heliconia  plants and it can be rewarding to ""stake-out"" a patch inside the forest. This  Rufous-breasted  (or Hairy)  Hermit  (right) was sitting right next to 'his'  Heliconia . Unlike many other hummingbirds, hermits are generally not territorial and few species have iridescence. When present, it is limited to the throat or crown. Nonetheless, it is obvious that hermits are hummingbirds, and even the most jaded ""I can't tell one bird from another"" non-naturalist can identify a hummingbird as such.                                                                                                                                                   Of course, not all hummingbirds are tropical, or appear to defy the laws of proportions, nor are all bright and colorful. Females and youngsters are often plainly-colored, particularly among the migratory species of North America This cryptic coloring can be important because only females sit on the nest, and if they were bright then they or the nestlings might more easily become prey. Hummingbird nests are often beautifully spun, like those of my local  Anna's Hummingbird  (above left) or the lichen-covered nest with almost-ready-to-fledge juvenal  Costa's Hummingbirds  (above right; it actual represents the first documented nesting in Monterey County, California).             Schuchmann (1999) summarizes hummingbird breeding biology this way: ""Male hummingbirds are polygamous, mating with several females during a reproductive period. In most species studied the male associates with the female only during a short period to fertilize her eggs. All remaining reproductive responsibilities like nest building, incubation, and rearing the young are carried out solely by the female."" He goes on to cite a few reports of males participating in incubation or rearing the young, particularly in some tropical species, but generally concludes that there is insufficient evidence to confirm any parental care by males. What then am I to make of this photo I took in Costa Rica? It appears to show a male  Blue-throated Goldentail  incubating a nest. The hummer is certainly this species and seems to be in male plumage with a glittering deep-blue throat. This is a lekking species, so why would a male be incubating? May females occasionally attain a male-like plumage? There are many mysteries here.                                                      Many North American hummingbirds are migratory, including Rufous Hummingbird shown at the top of this family account. Migratory hummers are susceptible to vagrancy, accounting for the variety of species that have reached California, including several  Violet-crowned Hummingbirds , one of which is shown at right (in Sonoma County; a first record for northern California). Surely the most unexpected was Xantus's Hummingbird  Hylocharis xantusii  from southern Baja California; a male visited interior San Diego Co. but a female built a nest and laid eggs in Ventura Co. (Hainebach 1992). The only Blue-throated Hummingbird  Lampornis clemenciae  to reach California – in Tulare Co. from Dec 1977-May 1978 – not only built a nest and laid eggs, but fledged three young! These appeared to be Blue-throated X Anna's hybrids (Baldridge et al. 1983).             The field identification of female North American hummingbirds is one of our most difficult problems. Stiles (1971, 1972), Baltosser (1987), Jones (1992), Heidcamp (1997), Howell (2002), and Williamson (2002) are all useful sources.                                       Many hummingbirds are endemics, limited to single  Caribbean islands, or isolated mountain chains, or, in the case of  Mangrove Hummingbird  (left, in full song and display), the mangrove swamps on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.              Some of these are threatened with extinction: 29 species are listed as endangered or vulnerable by Birdlife International, including Mangrove Hummingbird.              Surely the most sought-after of them all – rare, endangered, spectacular, and limited to a very small range in northern Peru – is  Marvelous Spatuletail , shown below in a wonderful shot by James Hecht. A separate page focused on this prized species, with more photos, is  elsewhere on this web site .                                                                                                                From  Green Violetear  (left), widespread from Mexico to Bolivia, to  Bearded Mountaineer  (right), endemic to the high Andes of central Peru, hummingbirds are fascinating. I could go on and on about them. They are reason enough alone to be a birdwatcher.

Bibliographic note : Although hummingbirds have inspired hundreds of books, there is no single family book. Such a work would be a difficult undertaking, since hummingbirds are the second largest family in the New World (after flycatchers) with over 330 species. Between 1849 and 1861, John Gould published a five volume  Hummingbirds  series totaling 418 lithographed plates capturing the beauty and aerial artistry of many South American hummers (now reprinted as Gould 1990). For many years, this was the major work on the family until Crawford Greenewalt (1960) published a spectacular set of color ""stop-action"" photographs of South American hummingbirds (Greenewalt's pioneering volume is now rare and expensive). Numerous other such books followed using strobe-flash technology to capture hummers in mid-flight, including Scheithauer (1966) and Dunning (1970) who included incredible Andean species, or Keppelman (1988) on southeast Arizona. I have found that by far the most useful for detailed identification purposes for North American species is Tyrell & Tyrell (1985), not because of the text (which is very general) but because the excellent photo quality is often sufficient to determine points like wing formula and remige or rectrix shape.                While not considered a ""family book"" per se, the Schuchmann (1999) chapter on the Trochilidae in the Handbook of the Birds of the World series now serves as the next best thing. At 213 pages, which include a field guide style painting of every species in the world plus perhaps the most spectacular set of photos of wild birds ever brought together, it is a major achievement. The text includes not only a solid introduction to the natural history of the family but 328 species accounts featuring 18 authors.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Closeup of  Southern Rockhopper Penguin  ( Eudyptes chrysocome ).       The number of extant penguin  species  is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands that  prey  on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot           Main article:  Penguins in popular culture       Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.
