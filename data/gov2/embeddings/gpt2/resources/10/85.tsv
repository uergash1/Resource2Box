Adobe Dreamweaver             Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 under Windows XP       Developed by   Adobe Systems  (formerly by  Macromedia )       Latest release   CS4 (10.0) /  23 September 2008 ; 144 days ago       Written in   C++       OS   Microsoft Windows ,  Mac OS X       Type   IDE       License   Proprietary       Website   Adobe Dreamweaver Homepage              Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 retail box       Adobe Dreamweaver  is a  web development   application  originally created by Allaire Systems, which was acquired around 1998 by  Macromedia  and is now owned by  Adobe Systems , which acquired Macromedia in 2005.   Dreamweaver is available for both  Mac  and  Windows   operating systems . Recent versions have incorporated support for  web  technologies such as  CSS ,  JavaScript , and various  server-side scripting   languages  and  frameworks  including  ASP.NET ,  ColdFusion ,  JavaServer Pages  (JSP), and  PHP .           Contents       1   Features     1.1   Syntax highlighting       2   Version history   3   Internationalisation and localisation     3.1   Language Availability   3.2   Specific Features for Arabic and Hebrew languages       4   See also   5   Notes   6   External links               [ edit ]   Features   As a  WYSIWYG   Presto -based editor, Dreamweaver can hide the HTML code details of pages from the user, making it possible for non-coders to create web pages and sites. One criticism of this approach is that it can produce  HTML  pages whose file size and amount of HTML code is larger than an optimally hand-coded page would be, which can cause  web browsers  to perform poorly. This can be particularly true because the application makes it very easy to create  table-based layouts . In addition, some web site developers have criticized Dreamweaver in the past for producing code that often does not comply with  W3C  standards, though recent versions have been more compliant. Dreamweaver 8.0 performed poorly on the  Acid2 Test , developed by the  Web Standards Project . However, Adobe has increased the support for CSS and other ways to lay out a page without tables in later versions of the application, with the ability to convert tables to layers and vice versa.   Dreamweaver allows users to preview websites in many browsers, provided that they are installed on their computer. It also has some site management tools, such as the ability to find and replace lines of text or code by whatever parameters specified across the entire site, and a templatisation feature for creating multiple pages with similar structures. The behaviours panel also enables use of basic JavaScript without any coding knowledge.   Dreamweaver can use ""Extensions""  small programs, which any web developer can write (usually in  HTML  and  JavaScript ). Extensions provide added functionality to the software for whoever wants to download and install them. Dreamweaver is supported by a large community of extension developers who make extensions available (both commercial and free) for most web development tasks from simple rollover effects to full-featured shopping carts.   Like  other HTML editors , Dreamweaver edits files locally, then uploads all edited files to the remote web server using  FTP ,  SFTP , or  WebDAV . Dreamweaver CS4 now supports the  Subversion (SVN)  version control system.     [ edit ]   Syntax highlighting   As of version 6, Dreamweaver supports  syntax highlighting  for the following languages out of the box:     ActionScript   Active Server Pages  (ASP). Previous versions supported ASP 1.1. ASP support has been dropped entirely in version CS4.   ASP.NET   C#   Cascading Style Sheets  (CSS)   ColdFusion   EDML   Extensible HyperText Markup Language  (XHTML)   Extensible Markup Language  (XML)   Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations  (XSLT)   HyperText Markup Language  (HTML)   Java   JavaScript   JavaServer Pages  (JSP)   PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor  (PHP)   Visual Basic  (VB)   Visual Basic Script Edition  (VBScript)   Wireless Markup Language  (WML)     It is also possible to add your own language syntax highlighting to its repertoire.   In addition,  code completion  is available for many of these languages.

[ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Specific Features for Arabic and Hebrew languages   The older Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 also features a Middle Eastern version that allows typing Arabic, Persian or Hebrew text (written from right to left) within the code view. Whether the text is fully Middle Eastern (written from right to left) or includes both English and Middle Eastern text (written left to right and right to left), it will be displayed properly in the browser.   The Middle Eastern versions are also available for  Adobe Acrobat ,  Adobe Photoshop ,  Adobe Illustrator ,  Adobe InDesign ,  Adobe InCopy  and for  Adobe Creative Suite  (Design Standard, Design Premium, Web Premium).

Althuogh i have to say that it has some problems in  portoble devices i mean hey nothing is perfect. It occasionaly has some problems in the regular stage. Though it is kind of slow.I still  think it is still pretty good. If I would rate this program I would give  it a 4......
