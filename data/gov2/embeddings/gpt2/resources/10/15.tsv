Every 10 years, this is the impossible          task that the Commerce Department's Census Bureau takes on. Census 2000          was billed by the bureau as ""the largest peacetime effort in the history          of the United States."" You may recall some of the hoopla surrounding this          effort in late 1999 and early 2000 as the nation prepared for National          Census Day-April 1.                     Counting seems to be the central theme of the United States in 2000, whether          it be dimpled and pregnant chads or each citizen living from the tip of          Maine to the Aleutian Islands off the most western part of Alaska. If          you live in the United States, there's a good chance that you received          one of the 98 million census forms that were mailed out by the Census          Bureau, and on April 1 an adult in each American household was supposed          to fill out this form and send it in. More than eight months later, the          official tally is in. Census 2000 shows that the resident population of          the United States as of April 1, 2000 is 281,421,906. That is a 13.2 percent          increase over 1990, when 248,709,873 were counted. See the Census Bureau          for details.                     The census is required by the U.S. Constitution under Article 1 Section          2, and performed once a decade to do more than just satisfy our curiosity          about the number of people that live in the country. In this edition of          How Stuff Works, you'll learn how the census is actually taken, how its          results are used to distribute federal funds and what impact the census          has on the U.S. House of Representatives.                     What Exactly Is the Census and How Long          Has It Been Around?                     The concept of a census, or counting of residents, is an ancient one dating          to Biblical times. The first census ever taken in North America, historians          say, was in 1576, 200 years before America gained its independence from          the British. Spanish King Philip II, who then ruled the large region,          sent American Indians through what is now Mexico with a list of 100 questions.          The Indians spoke no Spanish, so they recorded the answers in hieroglyphs          (pictures) and made maps the same way. (They even showed one-way streets          with footprints!)                    Since 1790, national census information has been taken every 10 years          (in years ending in zero) because it is mandated by the U.S. Constitution          and necessary to determining each area's representation in the U.S. House          of Representatives. In 1790, George Washington signed the act into law.          (Interestingly, several states had been taking their own census earlier          and continued to do so in non-zero-ending years.) While the Constitution          describes the census simply as an ""enumeration of inhabitants,"" the census          has evolved over time into a more comprehensive-and more useful-process.          Now, we can learn much more about our population than just the number          of people living in the United States.                     According to Judy Hanna Green's book Finding Treasures in the U.S. Federal          Census in 1790, the population of the United States was just under 4 million-not          counting slaves or the untaxed Indians. (A primary goal of the first census          was to provide information on men eligible for the military. On the heels          of the Revolutionary War, the new American citizens were especially conscious          of the importance of a strong military. Later, during the War of 1812,          much of the 1790 census was destroyed by fire.)                     In the first national census, 17 U.S. marshals appointed 200 assistants.          They rode on horseback all over the nation to count people, writing with          quill pens (Read more about pen history as How a Ballpoint Pen Works!)          on any scraps of paper they could find. The cost of that census project          was $45,000!                     Technology began to become part of census taking in 1890. The Census Bureau          developed a new electrical machine that could add up responses to questions          after census workers punched holes in the right places for each answer.          Cards were then fed into a machine that totaled the result. It was bulky          but a great advance at that time-anything that sped up the process was          a help since some of the results must be ready nine months after Census          Day (more about that later).                     The first modern computer, called ENIAC, was invented in 1946 at the University          of Pennsylvania. This computer, which was really many machines working          together, took up a whole room. The system was ready in time for use in          parts of the 1950 census, and the Census Bureau ordered its own computer,          called UNIVAC. That technology has improved over the years and now high-speed,          supercomputers are available to assist the census.                    Today, this technology plays a major role in the processing and census          data. The major automation features for Census 2000 include data capture          systems designed to handle the use of ""respondent-friendly"" questionnaires.          The Census Bureau uses the National Processing Center and works with contractors          who operate three processing centers responsible for a variety of data          capture functions:                      A full data capture and processing system records an image of every          questionnaire.            Questionnaires returned by mail will be sorted automatically to ensure          timely capture of   critical information needed before the non-response          follow-up.            Optical mark recognition will be used for all check-box data items.                     Intelligent character recognition (ICR) will be used to capture write-in          character-based data   items.            A clerical keying operation will capture and resolve difficult ICR cases.                     A quality assurance review will be conducted on data keying and scanning          activities.                     Census Bureau officials say the use of electronic imaging and captures          data in 2000 reduced the logistical and staffing requirements that accompany          handling large volumes of paper questionnaires.                     Most of the U.S. Census was taken door-to-door until 1960, when census          officials recognized the inefficiency of this method in dealing with such          a fast-growing, increasingly diverse and mobile population. That's when          they decided to use the mail to distribute forms. In the 1970 census,          about 60 percent was taken by mail and in 1980, about 90 percent. However,          in 1990, when the Census Bureau tried to take about 94 percent of the          census by mail, one in three households failed to return the forms. That's          why the most recent decennial census was the focus of a major, nationwide          awareness campaign, officials say.                    But neither technology nor mail has replaced the all-important census          team members. Among the thousands of workers today are:                      Administrators-They determine how each division of the Census Bureau          will do its part in the   census.            Enumerators-They go door-to-door to gather information from residents          who have not   returned their census forms.            Statisticians-They make sure the Census Bureau's math is right.            Demographers-These people understand the statistics and have studied          what statistics tell   about American life.                     They analyze the census numbers, comparing them with numbers from earlier          censuses, and tell us important things about the future. Why Is the Census          Important? Participating in the census is in everyone's best interest,          because the information on the forms is used by decision-makers to determine          which communities, schools, hospitals and roads need federal funding.          Filling out your census form is also the best way to make sure people          like you are represented in the census.                     Here are just a few examples of important uses for census numbers:                      The federal government uses census numbers to allocate over $100 billion          in federal funds annually for community programs and services, such as          education programs, housing and community development, health-care services          for the elderly, job training and many more.                      State, local and tribal governments use census information for planning          and allocating funds for new school construction, libraries and other          public buildings, highway safety and public transportation systems, new          roads and bridges, location of police and fire departments and many other          projects.                      Community organizations use census information to develop social service          programs, community action projects, senior lunch programs and child-care          centers.                      Businesses use the numbers to decide where to locate factories, shopping          centers, movie theaters, banks and offices-activities that often lead          to new jobs.                      The U.S. Congress uses the census totals to determine how many seats          your state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition,          states use the numbers to allocate seats in their law-making bodies. President          Clinton will deliver the apportionment counts to the 107th Congress during          the first week of its regular session in January 2000. The reapportioned          Congress, which will be the 108th, will convene in January 2003. This          reapportionment of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives could          have important political implications.                     All that we learn about ourselves through the census will help the United          States succeed over the next millennium. It's also a great way to tell          our leaders who we are and what we need. If you need a closer-to-home          reason for completing your census form, the Census Bureau suggests that          you consider the following:                      You can help your community thrive. Does your neighborhood have a lot          of traffic congestion, elderly people living alone or over-crowded schools?          Census numbers can help your community work out public improvement strategies.          Non-profit organizations use census numbers to estimate the number of          potential volunteers in communities across the nation.                     You can make your government work for you. The hundreds of billions          of dollars in federal and state funds allocated each year mean important          things to you-things such as school lunch programs, hospitals and highways!          (Using census numbers to support their request for a new community center,          senior citizens in one New England community successfully argued their          case before county commissioners.)                      You can get help when you need it. Many 911 emergency systems are based          on maps developed for the last census. Census information helps health          providers predict the spread of diseases through communities with children          or elderly people. And when floods, tornadoes or earthquakes hit, the          census tells rescuers how many people will need their help.                      You can help American businesses. Census numbers help industry reduce          financial risk and locate potential markets. This means that businesses          are able to determine the marketability of potential products and come          up products you want.                      You can get information you and your family need. Although individual          records are held confidential for 72 years (more about that coming up!),          you can request a certificate from past censuses that can be used to establish          your age, residence or relationship-information that could help you qualify          for a pension, establish citizenship or obtain an inheritance. (In 2072,          your great-grandchildren may want to use census information to research          family history. Right now, your children may be using census information          to do their homework.)                     Will I Sacrifice My Privacy If I Complete          the Form?                     By law, the Census Bureau cannot share your answers with others, including          welfare agencies, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Internal          Revenue Service, courts, police and the military. Under the provisions          of Title 13 of the U.S. Code, census bureau workers who break this law          face up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines. The law works-millions          of questionnaires were processed during the 1990s without any breach of          trust.                     This should also be reassuring: Did you know that the law required each          batch of census forms to remain private for 72 years? This is to encourage          honesty and accurate information. The rationale behind this law is that          little negative impact could happen after 72 years, since most of the          people listed would be gone. So, this means that the latest census available          to the public is the one taken in 1920.                     The process of microfilming and printing the census also takes a long          time to accomplish because of the 72-year wait and also by the sheer volume          of documents. (This process usually takes another two years or so to complete          and make ready for the public, according to bureau officials.)                     First results of Census 2000 will be the state population totals used          to reapportion the U.S. House of Representatives, which must be delivered          to the President in exactly nine months-by Dec. 31, 2000. More detailed          data used to redraw U.S. and state majority and minority leaders by April          1, 2001.                      How Does the Census Process Actually          Work?                     In early March 2000, 98 million census forms-both long and short forms-went          out in the mail to about 83 percent of the nation's residences. In addition,          census enumerators personally delivered about 22 million additional forms          to homes that lack street-name and house-number addresses, mostly in rural          and remote areas. These represent about 17 percent of the nation's housing          units. Hundreds of thousands of census takers and support personnel have          been hired to account for the anticipated 118 million housing units and          275 million people across the United States.                     The questionnaires were preceded by an advance letter sent a week or so          earlier. This letter gave residents the option of asking for questionnaires          in five languages besides English: Spanish, Tagalog, Korean, Chinese and          Vietnamese. Later this month (March), the Census Bureau then sent a reminder          card asking residents to mail back the form as soon as possible.                     During March of a census year, the Census Bureau conducts special operations          to count people with no fixed address or who live in dormitories, nursing          homes, prisons, shelters, trailer parks, transient housing and other groups          or non-standard housing.                     After April 1, census workers spend a couple of months trying to locate          and get information from households or families that failed to respond          by mail. If your questionnaire is incomplete, a census employee must contact          you to obtain the missing information. Then these answers are combined          with those on your questionnaire. It is these combined numbers-not your          individual answers-that are published.                     As census methodology has become more sophisticated, researchers have          begun to learn more about who responds and who doesn't. For example, the          overall non-response rate in 1990 was 25.3 percent. Researchers say response-or          lack of response-to the mailed 1990 Census questionnaires was highly correlated          with race and length of time at a residence. Researchers also said that          mail response to the 1990 Census was strongly related to family composition          (the number of parents in the home, the age of the single parent, etc.).                               How Can Homeless and Transient People          Be Counted?                     According to the Census Bureau, it enlists the help of local experts in          finding places where people without housing receive services, such as          emergency and transitional shelters, soup kitchens, regularly-scheduled          mobile food vans and targeted outdoor locations. Census workers go to          these locations to conduct the census.                     Partnerships with community-based organizations are essential to including          migrant and seasonal farm workers in the census. The Census Bureau seeks          the advice of local experts to find areas where migrant and seasonal workers          live and work, including unregistered labor camps, vehicles parked near          work sites and living areas along unnamed roads.                     Census takers interview people staying at campgrounds, fairs and carnivals          and marinas. Every person interviewed has the opportunity to report his          or her permanent address.                      Other Special Groups                     There are a number of other special groups that require special planning.          There are special procedures for ensuring that census information for          people living in remote areas is accurate. For example, in remote Alaska,          the census must be completed before the spring thaw. After the thaw, many          residents are away from their homes hunting or conducting other spring          activities. By then it is too late for counters to contact them.                     And the Census Bureau works with the Department of Defense and the U.S.          Coast Guard to identify living quarters on military installations and          ships. All ocean going, coastal and Great Lake ships take part in what          is known as the Census Maritime Enumeration. In addition, the Census Bureau's          plan accounts for military personnel and federal civilian government employees,          as well as their dependents, who are stationed overseas.                     When necessary, census takers assist residents who need help in completing          the forms. In some facilities, such as jails, the staff distributes census          questionnaires. These staff workers, like all census workers, are sworn          to protect the confidentiality of the individual.                     A complete set of residence rules telling where students, nursing home          residents, military personnel and others are counted can be found on the          Census Bureau's Web site.                      What About Children? Are They Counted?                              While considerable attention has been devoted to the undercount for the          U.S. population overall and to specific sub-groups such as young black          men in inner cities, less attention has been given to the undercount of          children.                     In an attempt to help remedy that problem, the Census Bureau has provided          more than 300,000 Census in Schools kits throughout the country. The purpose          of the kits is to increase participation in the census among children          and parents. ""In 1990, many parents did not record children on their census          questionnaire,"" Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said. ""This program is          one way we hope to ensure that every child is counted. We hope parents          will urge their schools and that teachers will urge their principals to          take part in the Census in Schools program.""                     The program provides students with a take-home letter explaining to parents          the importance of an accurate census. The letter is available in English,          Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Korean. Additional take-home          materials provide recreational census activities for students to complete          with their parents. Sent to the schools in February, each program teaching          guide contains lesson plans that address map literacy, community involvement          and information management. Kits are available for grades K-4, 5-8, 9-12.          Custom designed teaching kits were sent to schools in Puerto Rico, the          U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the          Northern Mariana Islands. (Scholastic Inc. helped to develop the program's          teaching materials most of which can be downloaded from the bureau's website.)                               What Is the Form Like?                     In 2000, the Census Bureau sent out about 83 million short forms (with          seven questions) and 15 million long forms (with 52 questions). Prewitt          says the short form asks for less information than is found on your driver's          license and takes about 10 minutes to complete. The long form takes about          38 minutes, he estimates. Although the rate varies according to population          density, in most areas about 5 out of 6 homes will receive the short form,          while the remaining 1 out of 6 will receive the long form. (In some rural          areas, as many as every other home may receive this long form, because          a larger sample is needed to ensure that these towns and counties get          the same detailed information as more densely populated areas.)                     The questionnaires have room for information on six household members.          If you have more than six living in your home, you should fill in the          additional names, and a Census Bureau representative will contact you          for more information.                     The short form-the shortest in 180 years-contains six population questions          and one housing question. The long form has 31 population questions (including          the six short-form population questions) and 21 housing questions (including          the short-form housing questions). Questions are included on the census          questionnaire only if they serve a legal or programmatic need, according          to census officials. (For information on these reasons, see the Census          Bureau's Web site.)                     For the first time, the 2000 census allowed you to identify yourself as          being more than one race. Participants in the census had the choice of          checking off as many race categories as they wished. Hispanics may be          of any race; therefore, there is one question on Hispanic origin and another          race.                     The only additional documents you need to help you complete the form are          income tax forms and property tax and homeowners' payment records. (Only          a few figures are needed.)                      What If I Have Questions About My Form?                              The Census Bureau will help you. Start by looking at these Help and Information          sites. In addition to the Census Bureau's very comprehensive Web site,          there are also questionnaire assistance centers in your community, and          a toll-free telephone number to call for assistance is written on the          form you received in the mail. If you've lost your form or didn't receive          one, you can call your local or regional center to find out where to get          one.                     When you think about it, participating in Census 2000 is being a part          of history in the making.

Since the early 1800s, however, policy makers have recognized that   an accurate census can provide other valuable information to improve the policy   process. Today, policy makers at all levels of government, as well as private   businesses, households, researchers, and nonprofit organizations, rely on an   accurate census in myriad ways that range far beyond the single fact of how   many people live in each state. This report provides a brief overview of these   uses.                   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES    Monitoring compliance with     Federal law.  Questions on ancestry, gender, race, Hispanic origin, language     spoken at home, place of birth, citizenship and year of entry provide critical     information for monitoring compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil     Rights Act, and other anti-discrimination and affirmative action plan     requirements.    Assessing economic well being.  Accurate census     data are critical for developing accurate assessments of economic well-being     for the Nation as a whole as well as for different racial, ethnic, and regional     populations.    Assisting families and low-income populations.      Accurate census data are critical for programs that aim to identify areas     eligible for housing assistance and rehabilitation loans; housing subsidies;     job training and employment services; energy cost assistance; and community     economic development. Accurate census data also are critical to allocating     funds for supplemental food programs and other social services for women and     children.    Assisting the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.      Accurate census data are required to determine and forecast the number of     persons eligible for benefits based on age, such as Social Security and     Medicare and to forecast the number of persons eligible for Social Security     disability benefits. They are necessary to develop baselines for reducing     employment barriers faced by persons with disabilities and to allocate funds     for vocational education and rehabilitation programs for disabled workers.     Accurate census data are required to determine where to build veterans     hospitals, to establish baselines for veteran population projections, and to     report to Congress on the needs of selected groups of veterans, such as     Vietnam-era and female veterans.    Education.  The accuracy of     census data affects the allocation of funding for numerous Federal education     programs such as vocational and adult education.    Other.  Census     data on farm residence help USDA assess housing conditions and needs on farms.     Information on place of work and journey to work helps the Federal government     formulate national transportation and energy-use policies.               STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT USES    Drawing legislative     boundaries.  Decisions on redistricting and the determination of state and     local voting district boundaries require accurate census data.        Education.  Accurate census data are critical to local government     agencies and school boards trying to determine the need for new schools,     including what type (elementary, middle, or high school).        Infrastructure, public health and environmental protection, and program     planning.  Numerous state and local government planning responsibilities     depend on accurate census data, including determining the need for schools,     highways, public transportation, hospitals, libraries, and police and fire     protection. Water and sewage disposal information helps identify needs for     water purification, treatment, or sewage facilities. Farm data are used to     allocate funds to land grant colleges, for cooperative extension activities,     and for grants to agricultural experiment stations. Accurate census data make     for better planning and implementation of a variety of programs, including     education and training, health, education, and social services. Accurate census     data help public health officials perform tasks such as locating areas in     danger of ground water contamination and waterborne diseases. They help     environmental agencies analyze energy consumption, identify conservation     opportunities, and forecast energy needs.    Disaster relief.      Accurate census information helps local governments predict transportation     needs in disaster recovery and contingency planning initiatives. The data help     governments and relief agencies in assessing the amount of displacement and the     shelter and recovery needs of populations affected by natural disasters such as     floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.    Assisting families,     low-income populations, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.  Accurate     census data are necessary for appropriate state implementation of Federal     programs for these groups in areas such as housing assistance, energy cost     assistance, community development, and employment and social services. Accurate     census data also help city and community officials pinpoint areas that need     special programs such as meals-on-wheels and social service agencies identify     special needs such as telephone access in case of medical emergency.               BUSINESS USES    Product development and marketing.      Accurate census data on where people of different ages live helps businesses of     all kinds to develop and market their products. For example:                      Manufacturers of baby products such as baby food, clothes,       diapers, and toys, and manufacturers of maternity clothes and greeting cards       need accurate information on children as they develop and market their product       lines, as do television producers of children’s programs and planners of       large family amusement parks.               Architects, contractors, and real estate firms need accurate       information on the size and composition of households and their housing as they       design, build, and sell houses and apartments.               Producers of consumer durables such as television sets, washing       machines, and home furnishings benefit from accurate information on households       and their characteristics.               Accurate census information on language spoken at home helps       television and radio stations define foreign language service areas and       marketing companies develop products and services tailored to those who speak       languages other than English.               Forecasting demand.  Businesses forecasting demand for their     products require accurate census data to develop these forecasts. Utilities     depend on accurate census data to develop long-range plans for new facilities     and networks.        Location decisions.  A variety of business location decisions     are improved by accurate census data. Examples include: businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas to gauge potential markets for locating new stores, plants, or     warehouses; businesses interested in finding sites having a labor force with     certain education characteristics; building developers and contractors     selecting sites for new housing developments; and businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas of a city for locating new restaurants specializing in     particular types of ethnic food.        Providing equal opportunities and achieving compliance with     Federal law.          Accurate census data help businesses set up and monitor affirmative     action and anti-discrimination plans. And they help companies to comply with     anti-discrimination legislation such as the Equal Employment Opportunities     Act.        Examples of Business Use of Census Data.  Newspaper accounts     and census questionnaires provide examples of businesses that use census data.       Numerous small businesses responded to a request for examples of     business uses of census data, but so too did some large companies. For example,     one large fast-food chain reported that for the past 20 years they had relied     on decennial censuses to perform market analysis and determine site locations     for new restaurants. The company also has used the Census Bureau’s TIGER     Line files (a digital map database) to merge their own proprietary information     with the detailed social and economic data from the decennial census for small     geographic areas for use in its corporate planning.        Around the time of the last census, a prominent newspaper ran a lead     article in its Business section entitled, ""For Business, Census is a Marketing     Data Motherlode."" The article noted how retailers, such as one large general     merchandise company, use the census to fine-tune neighborhood promotions; how a     large grocery chain used it to study potential sites for new stores; and how     one consumer products firm used it to estimate sales of diapers a decade out.     The article also described how banks use census data to provide a basic     demographic sketch of the neighborhoods around each of their branches.        Examples of uses of census data culled from a sample of monthly     activity reports from the Census Bureau’s Regional Office Information     Services Program include the following:                      An independent television station in Philadelphia that is using       ZIP code level data for a viewer profile to design program and advertising       strategies.               A foreign language newspaper distributor seeking increased       circulation in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut used census data to list       languages spoken at home in each county of the three states.               A major advertising firm used census data on languages spoken at       home in the Chicago area to develop a new advertising campaign for a       client.               A district sales office for an automobile manufacturer is using       ZIP Code and city profiles for a market analysis that will be used to help       local dealerships develop sales campaigns.               A real estate company in Colorado is using census data to       determine which languages to use on a series of instructional tapes on buying       and selling real estate.                      COMMUNITY GROUP USES         Delivering health, social, and educational services.  In many     cases, private social service agencies and community groups have the same needs     for accurate census data as state and local government agencies that provide     social services. Private groups benefit from accurate census data to set up and     administer assistance programs for children, teens, and older persons; to     provide services that reflect cultural differences; to teach English, and     conduct voter registration drives; to provide housing and job training for     displaced homemakers; to provide veteran support services and promote the need     for veteran services and facilities.        Disaster relief.  As with social services, non-governmental     organizations benefit from accurate census information in much the same way as     governments when planning for and responding to disasters like hurricanes,     tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes.               INDIVIDUAL USES        Location decisions.  Individuals can make better choices about     home-buying, job relocation, or starting a small business if they can take     advantage of accurate census information.               ACADEMIC RESEARCH USES         Accurate census data are vital to researchers in a wide variety of     endeavors. Some of the most important needs include the following:                      Any research requiring comprehensive information at the       neighborhood level must rely on the census, with its tract level       information.              Research on ethnicity or other research requiring reasonable       numbers of observations of relatively small population groups must rely on the       census.              The decennial census is the only consistent source of data for       researchers examining trends over periods of decades.              The census is the best source of information for research on       immigration and mobility.                      USES BY OTHER SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION        Serving as an important base for other surveys.  Data from the     decennial Census form a crucial input into the sample designs of other national     surveys such as the Current Population Survey (the source of the nation’s     unemployment statistics), the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the     National Crime Victimization Survey, the Survey of Recent College Graduates,     the Consumer Expenditure Survey (the source for expenditure weights used in     calculating the Consumer Price Index), and statistics complied by the National     Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Center for Health     Statistics (NCHS).        Calculating rates.  Data from other sources are combined with     data from the Census to compute rates of various indicators. For example, NCHS     uses its own survey data combined with Census data to calculate numerous vital     statistics and rates for health service utilization. Similarly, the Bureau of     Justice Statistics uses Census data to calculate imprisonment and victimization     rates, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses Census data to calculate     crime rates.        Creating national estimates.  Census data are used to adjust     surveys to be nationally representative. For example, the NCES uses Census data     to make its survey results on education indicators reflect the total United     States population.        Case Study: The Current Population Survey.  Information on the     labor force, employment, and unemployment is derived from the monthly Current     Population Survey (CPS). The March supplement to the CPS provides information     for calculating the poverty rate and measures of household and family income.     The accuracy of the CPS depends critically on the accuracy of census     information, because all of the population “controls” for a decade     are derived from the previous decennial census. These population controls are     then updated monthly using estimates of births, deaths, and migration. The BLS     has incorporated information about the undercount in the 1990 census into the     CPS.        BLS Commissioner Abraham has advised Census Director Prewitt that if     the BLS had not incorporated the undercount, and, instead, used the official     1990 census population estimates used for apportionment, its estimate of the     working age population would have been too low by 2.1 million. Labor force     information for persons of Hispanic origin and blacks would have been affected     disproportionately because these groups make up three-fourths of persons not     counted in the official statistics. Without information on the undercount, BLS     says its estimates of the overall level of employment and unemployment would     have been too low, and the geographic and demographic distribution of     unemployment (and other measures) shown in their data would have been     inaccurate. Moreover these errors would have persisted for (at least) the next     10 years.         Unemployment statistics from the CPS are included in the allocation     formulas used to distribute funds in many Federal programs. Use of inaccurate     population estimates could cause a shift of several percent in a state’s     allocation. Many Federal programs are tied to the poverty rate, which could     also be affected by inaccurate population counts. This and other information     derived from the CPS affects evaluations of such initiatives as welfare reform,     health insurance legislation, and minimum wage legislation.

GX026-36-9166617	"The Uses of Census Data: An Analytical Review         April 1, 2000      A Report by the Council of Economic Advisers        PDF Version of Report     PDF Information     (34 kb)           OVERVIEW:        Constitutionally, the purpose of the decennial census is to ensure an   accurate apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives based on state   populations. Since the early 1800s, however, policy makers have recognized that   an accurate census can provide other valuable information to improve the policy   process. Today, policy makers at all levels of government, as well as private   businesses, households, researchers, and nonprofit organizations, rely on an   accurate census in myriad ways that range far beyond the single fact of how   many people live in each state. This report provides a brief overview of these   uses.                   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES    Monitoring compliance with     Federal law.  Questions on ancestry, gender, race, Hispanic origin, language     spoken at home, place of birth, citizenship and year of entry provide critical     information for monitoring compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil     Rights Act, and other anti-discrimination and affirmative action plan     requirements.    Assessing economic well being.  Accurate census     data are critical for developing accurate assessments of economic well-being     for the Nation as a whole as well as for different racial, ethnic, and regional     populations.    Assisting families and low-income populations.      Accurate census data are critical for programs that aim to identify areas     eligible for housing assistance and rehabilitation loans; housing subsidies;     job training and employment services; energy cost assistance; and community     economic development. Accurate census data also are critical to allocating     funds for supplemental food programs and other social services for women and     children.    Assisting the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.      Accurate census data are required to determine and forecast the number of     persons eligible for benefits based on age, such as Social Security and     Medicare and to forecast the number of persons eligible for Social Security     disability benefits. They are necessary to develop baselines for reducing     employment barriers faced by persons with disabilities and to allocate funds     for vocational education and rehabilitation programs for disabled workers.     Accurate census data are required to determine where to build veterans     hospitals, to establish baselines for veteran population projections, and to     report to Congress on the needs of selected groups of veterans, such as     Vietnam-era and female veterans.    Education.  The accuracy of     census data affects the allocation of funding for numerous Federal education     programs such as vocational and adult education.    Other.  Census     data on farm residence help USDA assess housing conditions and needs on farms.     Information on place of work and journey to work helps the Federal government     formulate national transportation and energy-use policies.               STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT USES    Drawing legislative     boundaries.  Decisions on redistricting and the determination of state and     local voting district boundaries require accurate census data.        Education.  Accurate census data are critical to local government     agencies and school boards trying to determine the need for new schools,     including what type (elementary, middle, or high school).        Infrastructure, public health and environmental protection, and program     planning.  Numerous state and local government planning responsibilities     depend on accurate census data, including determining the need for schools,     highways, public transportation, hospitals, libraries, and police and fire     protection. Water and sewage disposal information helps identify needs for     water purification, treatment, or sewage facilities. Farm data are used to     allocate funds to land grant colleges, for cooperative extension activities,     and for grants to agricultural experiment stations. Accurate census data make     for better planning and implementation of a variety of programs, including     education and training, health, education, and social services. Accurate census     data help public health officials perform tasks such as locating areas in     danger of ground water contamination and waterborne diseases. They help     environmental agencies analyze energy consumption, identify conservation     opportunities, and forecast energy needs.    Disaster relief.      Accurate census information helps local governments predict transportation     needs in disaster recovery and contingency planning initiatives. The data help     governments and relief agencies in assessing the amount of displacement and the     shelter and recovery needs of populations affected by natural disasters such as     floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.    Assisting families,     low-income populations, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.  Accurate     census data are necessary for appropriate state implementation of Federal     programs for these groups in areas such as housing assistance, energy cost     assistance, community development, and employment and social services. Accurate     census data also help city and community officials pinpoint areas that need     special programs such as meals-on-wheels and social service agencies identify     special needs such as telephone access in case of medical emergency.               BUSINESS USES    Product development and marketing.      Accurate census data on where people of different ages live helps businesses of     all kinds to develop and market their products. For example:                      Manufacturers of baby products such as baby food, clothes,       diapers, and toys, and manufacturers of maternity clothes and greeting cards       need accurate information on children as they develop and market their product       lines, as do television producers of children’s programs and planners of       large family amusement parks.               Architects, contractors, and real estate firms need accurate       information on the size and composition of households and their housing as they       design, build, and sell houses and apartments.               Producers of consumer durables such as television sets, washing       machines, and home furnishings benefit from accurate information on households       and their characteristics.               Accurate census information on language spoken at home helps       television and radio stations define foreign language service areas and       marketing companies develop products and services tailored to those who speak       languages other than English.               Forecasting demand.  Businesses forecasting demand for their     products require accurate census data to develop these forecasts. Utilities     depend on accurate census data to develop long-range plans for new facilities     and networks.        Location decisions.  A variety of business location decisions     are improved by accurate census data. Examples include: businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas to gauge potential markets for locating new stores, plants, or     warehouses; businesses interested in finding sites having a labor force with     certain education characteristics; building developers and contractors     selecting sites for new housing developments; and businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas of a city for locating new restaurants specializing in     particular types of ethnic food.        Providing equal opportunities and achieving compliance with     Federal law.          Accurate census data help businesses set up and monitor affirmative     action and anti-discrimination plans. And they help companies to comply with     anti-discrimination legislation such as the Equal Employment Opportunities     Act.        Examples of Business Use of Census Data.  Newspaper accounts     and census questionnaires provide examples of businesses that use census data.       Numerous small businesses responded to a request for examples of     business uses of census data, but so too did some large companies. For example,     one large fast-food chain reported that for the past 20 years they had relied     on decennial censuses to perform market analysis and determine site locations     for new restaurants. The company also has used the Census Bureau’s TIGER     Line files (a digital map database) to merge their own proprietary information     with the detailed social and economic data from the decennial census for small     geographic areas for use in its corporate planning.        Around the time of the last census, a prominent newspaper ran a lead     article in its Business section entitled, ""For Business, Census is a Marketing     Data Motherlode."" The article noted how retailers, such as one large general     merchandise company, use the census to fine-tune neighborhood promotions; how a     large grocery chain used it to study potential sites for new stores; and how     one consumer products firm used it to estimate sales of diapers a decade out.     The article also described how banks use census data to provide a basic     demographic sketch of the neighborhoods around each of their branches.        Examples of uses of census data culled from a sample of monthly     activity reports from the Census Bureau’s Regional Office Information     Services Program include the following:                      An independent television station in Philadelphia that is using       ZIP code level data for a viewer profile to design program and advertising       strategies.               A foreign language newspaper distributor seeking increased       circulation in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut used census data to list       languages spoken at home in each county of the three states.               A major advertising firm used census data on languages spoken at       home in the Chicago area to develop a new advertising campaign for a       client.               A district sales office for an automobile manufacturer is using       ZIP Code and city profiles for a market analysis that will be used to help       local dealerships develop sales campaigns.               A real estate company in Colorado is using census data to       determine which languages to use on a series of instructional tapes on buying       and selling real estate.                      COMMUNITY GROUP USES         Delivering health, social, and educational services.  In many     cases, private social service agencies and community groups have the same needs     for accurate census data as state and local government agencies that provide     social services. Private groups benefit from accurate census data to set up and     administer assistance programs for children, teens, and older persons; to     provide services that reflect cultural differences; to teach English, and     conduct voter registration drives; to provide housing and job training for     displaced homemakers; to provide veteran support services and promote the need     for veteran services and facilities.        Disaster relief.  As with social services, non-governmental     organizations benefit from accurate census information in much the same way as     governments when planning for and responding to disasters like hurricanes,     tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes.               INDIVIDUAL USES        Location decisions.  Individuals can make better choices about     home-buying, job relocation, or starting a small business if they can take     advantage of accurate census information.               ACADEMIC RESEARCH USES         Accurate census data are vital to researchers in a wide variety of     endeavors. Some of the most important needs include the following:                      Any research requiring comprehensive information at the       neighborhood level must rely on the census, with its tract level       information.              Research on ethnicity or other research requiring reasonable       numbers of observations of relatively small population groups must rely on the       census.              The decennial census is the only consistent source of data for       researchers examining trends over periods of decades.              The census is the best source of information for research on       immigration and mobility.                      USES BY OTHER SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION        Serving as an important base for other surveys.  Data from the     decennial Census form a crucial input into the sample designs of other national     surveys such as the Current Population Survey (the source of the nation’s     unemployment statistics), the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the     National Crime Victimization Survey, the Survey of Recent College Graduates,     the Consumer Expenditure Survey (the source for expenditure weights used in     calculating the Consumer Price Index), and statistics complied by the National     Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Center for Health     Statistics (NCHS).        Calculating rates.  Data from other sources are combined with     data from the Census to compute rates of various indicators. For example, NCHS     uses its own survey data combined with Census data to calculate numerous vital     statistics and rates for health service utilization. Similarly, the Bureau of     Justice Statistics uses Census data to calculate imprisonment and victimization     rates, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses Census data to calculate     crime rates.        Creating national estimates.  Census data are used to adjust     surveys to be nationally representative. For example, the NCES uses Census data     to make its survey results on education indicators reflect the total United     States population.        Case Study: The Current Population Survey.  Information on the     labor force, employment, and unemployment is derived from the monthly Current     Population Survey (CPS). The March supplement to the CPS provides information     for calculating the poverty rate and measures of household and family income.     The accuracy of the CPS depends critically on the accuracy of census     information, because all of the population “controls” for a decade     are derived from the previous decennial census. These population controls are     then updated monthly using estimates of births, deaths, and migration. The BLS     has incorporated information about the undercount in the 1990 census into the     CPS.        BLS Commissioner Abraham has advised Census Director Prewitt that if     the BLS had not incorporated the undercount, and, instead, used the official     1990 census population estimates used for apportionment, its estimate of the     working age population would have been too low by 2.1 million. Labor force     information for persons of Hispanic origin and blacks would have been affected     disproportionately because these groups make up three-fourths of persons not     counted in the official statistics. Without information on the undercount, BLS     says its estimates of the overall level of employment and unemployment would     have been too low, and the geographic and demographic distribution of     unemployment (and other measures) shown in their data would have been     inaccurate. Moreover these errors would have persisted for (at least) the next     10 years.         Unemployment statistics from the CPS are included in the allocation     formulas used to distribute funds in many Federal programs. Use of inaccurate     population estimates could cause a shift of several percent in a state’s     allocation. Many Federal programs are tied to the poverty rate, which could     also be affected by inaccurate population counts. This and other information     derived from the CPS affects evaluations of such initiatives as welfare reform,     health insurance legislation, and minimum wage legislation.

GX015-46-5419761	"Legal Authority for American Community Survey, B-289852, April 4, 2002              B-289852            April 4, 2002     The Honorable Bob Barr  Vice Chairman  Committee on Government Reform  House of Representatives      Subject:   Legal Authority for American Community Survey      Dear Mr. Vice Chairman:     This responds to your letter regarding the legal authority of the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) to conduct the American Community Survey (ACS), a monthly survey of a sample of households that, beginning in 2003, is intended to replace the long form questionnaire for the decennial census in 2010.  You asked us to provide (1) the legal authority under which the Bureau is conducting the ACS, including any legislative history concerning the development and implementation of ACS, (2) the Bureau's legal authority to require recipients to respond to the ACS, and (3) information on any other federal government questionnaires or surveys that require similar specific, detailed personal information be provided to the government.     In order to respond to your questions, we examined various legislative materials such as public laws, committee reports and hearings, and the Congressional Record for references to the ACS, requested and received comments from the Department of Commerce (Commerce), and met informally with Commerce and Bureau officials to discuss these issues.  We also searched an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) database for surveys that require specific detailed personal information.  As discussed in detail below, we find that the Bureau has the authority under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193 to conduct the ACS.  Although there is little legislative action tracking this Bureau initiative, the Bureau clearly has authority to require responses from the public to this survey.  See 13 U.S.C. § 221.  The Bureau must still receive clearance for the ACS through the Paperwork Reduction Act process.  Finally, we found no other government surveys that respondents are required to respond to that ask specific, detailed personal information similar to that required by the ACS.       BACKGROUND     According to Commerce, the ACS, which is designed to replace the long form portion for future decennial censuses, tracks the questions asked in the long form questionnaire from the 2000 Census.  The long form questionnaire asked a sample of persons and households for information on population topics, such as ancestry, veteran status, disability, labor force status, and income, and housing topics, such as value of home or rent paid, size and age of structure, plumbing and kitchen facilities, and expenses for utilities, mortgage, and taxes.      The Bureau began conducting supplementary surveys of selected counties under its authority at 13 U.S.C. § 182 in 1996 using the ACS methodology to test the operational feasibility of collecting long form type data in a different methodology from that of the decennial census.  Beginning in 2003, the Bureau plans to expand the ACS nationwide in a yearly sample of three million households (250,000 each month) as part of its decennial census in order to move from a once-every-ten years activity to continuous data collection and data dissemination.  By starting in 2003, data will be available for areas and population groups of 65,000 or more beginning in 2004 and for small areas and population groups of less than 20,000 people beginning in 2008. [1]   According to Bureau officials, this will provide information on a timelier basis than is now currently available.  For example, the most current long form information available from the Bureau is from the 1990 Census, since the 2000 Census data will not be available until this summer.     According to Commerce, the ACS information will provide more current data to a number of federal agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture.      DISCUSSION     Article I of the United States Constitution requires an enumeration of the population every ten years ""in such Manner as they [Congress] shall by Law direct.""  U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 3.  To implement this Constitutional requirement, Congress enacted 13 U.S.C. § 141, which requires ""a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year . . . in such form and content as he [the Secretary of Commerce] may determine . . . .  In connection with any such census, the Secretary is authorized to obtain such other census information as necessary.""  Section 141 also authorizes the decennial census to include the use of sampling procedures and special surveys. [2]   The uses of census data have grown significantly beyond congressional apportionment of representatives in Congress into many other areas such as managing federal agencies, allocating federal aid and assistance, assisting local governments, and helping businesses. [3]   The courts have generally viewed the authority of Commerce and the Bureau to gather census information broadly. [4]    In a recent court decision,  Morales v. Evans , [5]  the court held that the questions and the long form from the 2000 census are constitutional.     In  Morales , the court first reviewed both the short form and the long form questions from the 2000 Census and traced the origin of each question from prior censuses.  The court noted the authority of the Bureau to collect more than headcount information, and then specifically addressed whether such collection violated the plaintiffs rights under the Fifth Amendment (due process), First Amendment (protection against compelled speech), and Fourth Amendment (unreasonable and illegal search).  In each instance the court found the collection of information related to governmental purposes and there was no basis for holding such collection unconstitutional.     While Census clearly has authority to conduct the ACS, we found no public laws, committee reports, or other congressional actions in which Congress has required the Bureau to develop and implement the ACS.  Two oversight hearings were held in 2000 and 2001 concerning the ACS, [6]  and Congress has provided funding over the past several years for this program under the caption of ""continuous measurement."" [7]   Commerce states that testing of the ACS has been part of the President's budget since 1996 and a pilot program has been funded since that time.  Commerce also points out that it has regularly kept Congress informed of the development and intended implementation of the ACS in the annual budget justification that accompanies the President's budget.  It is clear that Census was not reacting to congressional direction in developing the ACS but acting on its own initiative to address the costs associated with the collection of data in the decennial census and the timeliness of that data.      On the basis of the statutory authority cited above and the discretion recognized by the courts, we conclude that Commerce and the Bureau have the legal authority to conduct the ACS under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193.  This finding does not address the question of whether the data should be collected, but only whether there is sufficient legal authority to conduct this annual survey. [8]       With regard to the question of whether the Bureau may require recipients to respond to the ACS, Bureau officials stated that the ACS is conducted under sections 141 and 193, cited above, and that because responses to Census Bureau censuses and surveys are required under 13 U.S.C. § 221, responses to the ACS are mandatory.  Section 221 subjects recipients of a survey to monetary penalties for failure to answer questions on any survey conducted by the Bureau under certain authorities found in Chapter 5 of Title 13 of the United States Code.  These authorities include censuses of manufacturers and other businesses under section 131, the decennial census of population under section 141, and interim current data for collection of population data between each census under section 181.  Section 225 permits application of penal provisions in certain cases.  For example, the provision for imprisonment does not apply to the interim current data surveys under section 181, although it does apply to the decennial census.  13 U.S.C. § 225(b).  We note that the courts have held that there is a sufficient governmental interest to require the collection of census data and to assess penalties for the failure to comply. [9]   We conclude therefore that the Bureau may require responses to the ACS survey.  With regard to providing statutory references for each question on the survey which is ""required by federal law to manage or evaluate government programs,"" Commerce noted that each federal agency submits to the Interagency Committee for the ACS, led by OMB, its legal justifications for agency-specific topics and questions, and the questionnaire content is reviewed by the Interagency Committee.  Commerce has provided an extensive table of statutory authorities to justify each question, but the response from Commerce notes that additional information may be added or corrected by the agencies as Commerce prepares its submission of the ACS questionnaire under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) clearance process. [10]   Since this process for development of the ACS questionnaire is still underway, we cannot state as a matter of law whether the requisite statutory authority supports each question.  However, Commerce and the Bureau will be required under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. §§ 3506 and 3507 to demonstrate that this collection of information is necessary, is not duplicative, and is understandable to those who are to respond.     Finally, to determine what other federal government surveys require specific, detailed personal information, we used information provided by federal agencies on Form 83-I, the Paperwork Reduction Act submission to OMB. [11]   Agencies requesting clearance to collect information are required to report on this form the various characteristics of the collection including the following:  who the collection affects-e.g., individuals or households, businesses, or the federal government; whether responses to the collection are voluntary, required to obtain or retain benefits, or mandatory; and the purpose of the collection--e.g., program evaluation, general purpose statistics, regulatory, or compliance.     Using information provided by OMB, we found no other government surveys that respondents are required to fill out that request specific, detailed personal information similar to that required by the ACS.  The only information collections that met the conditions of being required or mandatory and affecting individuals or households for statistical or research purposes were those related to the 2000 decennial censuses, including the ACS.      CONCLUSION     For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau has authority under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193 to conduct the American Community Survey.  The Bureau also has authority to require responses from the public to this survey.       We trust that this responds to your request.  Should you have any questions, please contact Ms. Susan A. Poling at (202) 512-2667.  We are sending an identical letter to The Honorable Dan Burton Chairman, Committee on Government Reform.     Sincerely yours,  Anthony H.

GX024-95-2350898	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF        WILLIAM G. BARRON, Jr.        ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS        Before the Subcommittee on the Census        Committee on Government Reform        U.S. House of Representatives        June 13, 2001          Mr. Chairman, Mr. Clay, and Members of the Subcommittee:      It is a pleasure to appear before you again and to testify at this second hearing on the American Community Survey.  The Subcommittee's leadership, Mr. Chairman, in providing a public forum for discussing the ACS is greatly appreciated.         The American Community Survey is Part of the Strategy for a Re-engineered 2010 Census      The ACS is one of three key components of our strategy for re-engineering the 2010 Census.  As Secretary Evans testified in a Senate hearing on March 28: ""While Census 2000 was an operational success and produced data of high quality, the process was costly, many people felt burdened by having to answer the long form questions, and the census was constantly at risk due to insufficient early planning and development, and disagreement on the design.""  If the Census Bureau has adequate resources early to build upon the successes of Census 2000 and to take advantage of lessons learned from Census 2000, then we can reduce operational risks for the 2010 Census, explore ways to further reduce the undercount and improve accuracy, provide more relevant and timely data throughout the decade, and contain costs.      While our strategic plan for the 2010 Census is still under development, we have identified what we believe are the three main components:  1) improving the accuracy of our geographic database and Master Address File, 2) eliminating the long form from the 2010 Census by collecting those data in the American Community Survey, and 3) re-engineering the census process through early planning.      We are planning improved geographic systems to ensure that there is a complete and unduplicated address list, that will facilitate automation and electronic data collection, and that will also provide the potential for significant efficiencies.  We plan to investigate the use of Global Positioning System technology and satellite mapping imagery to link addresses to physical locations, which will allow accurate updating and improvement of Census 2000 maps and address information.      The ACS will simplify the 2010 Census requirements and allow the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on the basic count of the population.  It will provide more current and more frequent detailed data for businesses and local, state, and federal policymakers for small geographic areas and allow the federal statistical system to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.  Data users now must still use 1990 long form data, data that will be 12 years old next year, when we begin the release of Census 2000 long form data.  The ACS will allow federal policymakers, businesses, and state, local and tribal governments to make decisions using more current data and will improve the distribution of federal funds.       Early 2010 planning and development are necessary for a re-engineered process for the 2010 Census that takes advantage of the potential opportunities provided by having improved geographic systems and the ACS.      Mr. Chairman, in your opening remarks at last July's hearing on the ACS you said: ""Today we are here to begin the process of eliminating the problematic census long form."" The process of eliminating the census long form is well underway.  That is why the ACS is one of the three key components of the plan for re-engineering the 2010 Census.  It will allow us to eliminate the long form from the 2010 Census and collect data on congressionally mandated topics in an annual sample survey.        Census 2000 required the processing of more than 1.5 billion pieces of paper.  About 60 percent of  this paper was associated with the long form.  It took a lot of talent, time, money, and effort to process that much paper.  Implementing the vision, Mr. Chairman, of simplifying the decennial census by eliminating the long form will introduce opportunities for cost savings and improved coverage, and greatly enhance the Census Bureau's ability to streamline and modernize the census-taking process.      Replacing the long form with the American Community Survey will permit the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on conducting the basic count in 2010.  It will allow us to streamline data capture, accommodate more multiple language response, increase mail response, and lower field costs.  It will lead to better coverage of addresses in the census because it will require a continuously updated address list.  Ongoing interaction with local officials will allow us to avoid the just-in-time address updating operations for the 2000 Census.  The ACS will also provide current data to permit the Census Bureau to more effectively target areas where special procedures will be required in 2010.  We are also looking at ways to use the highly trained ACS field staff as a cadre of key supervisory staff for the 2010 Census.  Because they will have been collecting ACS data successfully in hard-to-enumerate areas, they will have developed relationships with local leaders that will prove invaluable in more completely enumerating the population in the 2010 Census.      Mr. Chairman, you asked that I address the issue of costs.  The Census Bureau recognizes that there are substantial up-front costs in the early years of the decade for this strategy.  For example, our preliminary estimate of the cost of the ACS for FY 2003, the first year of collecting data in every part of the country, is $131 million, subject, of course, to the regular budget process.  As I stated in my letter to you, Mr. Chairman, of April 19, 2001, there will be only 9 months of nonresponse followup field work in the first year, which lowers the cost somewhat compared with all future years. Our initial estimates of life-cycle costs will demonstrate cost neutrality when we compare the estimated cost of repeating Census 2000 to the estimated cost of a re-engineered 2010 Census, which includes the ACS, geographic system modernization, and early planning.  To achieve cost neutrality, and even have some potential for cost savings, while also providing so much more data throughout the decade, is a notable achievement.      A Balanced Design for the American Community Survey      Now, Mr. Chairman, I will turn to the ACS, and first describe how we worked with the statistical system and data users to balance issues related to cost, feasibility, data quality, and respondent burden in designing the program.  The ACS is not designed to provide a headcount.  That is what the decennial census is for.  The Census Bureau has a population estimates program to provide updated population totals for years following the most recent census.  The ACS will serve a similar role in providing updated population and housing characteristics.       Our goal in designing the ACS was to produce data comparable in quality to the decennial census long form for the smallest areas such as census tracts.  One decision was how many years should go into the moving averages that will replace the long form estimates.  We decided on a 5-year average for the ACS that will give more timely data throughout the entire decade, and will give much better information about change over time than a once-a-decade measurement.       Another decision was to determine how much sample was needed each year so that the 5-year averages would have a sample size to provide data of sufficient quality.  We chose a sample size of 3 million because that will meet our goal of producing data based on 5-year averages that are comparable to census long form data for the smallest areas such as census tracts.  These data will be available in 2008, 4 years earlier than from a 2010 long form, and they will be updated annually thereafter.  Moreover, the first data for communities of 65,000 people or more will be available in 2004, about 6 months after the 2003 data collection year ends, and every year thereafter.  The first data for communities with between 20,000 and 65,000 people will be available in 2006, and also updated annually after they are first available.        The Census Bureau will mail questionnaires to each address in the sample and will use purchased lists of telephone numbers to interview households that do not mail back their form.  We will select a one-in-three sample of the addresses not interviewed by mail or telephone and conduct personal visit interviews.  Since personal visit interviews are very expensive, this sub-sampling will reduce costs while providing the desired level of accuracy.  The quality of data is improved by using well-trained, permanent interviewers with computers to complete interviews.    Computer-assisted interviewing by telephone or in person allows the Census Bureau to incorporate consistency checks of the data into the collection process.  Data quality is further improved by the use of a permanent staff to code write-in entries for processing.      The American Community Survey will be based on making the most efficient use of existing systems and infrastructure. It will not require additional offices, but will be run out of our current regional offices.  Field interviewers, who work on other surveys in addition to the ACS, will use existing laptop computers, and laptops from Census 2000 can be used as replacements, to the extent possible.  As I noted in my letter of April 19, for FY 2003 the ACS will require about 1,230 full-time staff and 3,800 part-time staff.   We will not require special data capture centers, as that will be accomplished in our processing center in Jeffersonville, Indiana.   The Census Bureau is working to provide electronic versions of maps that will reside on the interviewers' laptops; this will reduce the massive requirements for paper copies of maps we encountered in the decennial census.  We do not anticipate, at this time, any advertising expenditures for the ACS because its small monthly sample size would make it inefficient to use mass marketing methods such as we needed for the decennial census.  We do expect to use community partnerships, which we have found to be very effective in the early test sites.        Mr. Chairman, you also asked whether the ACS would replace or incorporate any additional Census Bureau surveys.  While there are no current plans to replace any existing surveys, the ACS can help make the entire federal statistical system more efficient in a number of ways by improving existing programs.  They include the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics will use ACS data as part of its Local Area Unemployment Statistics program to make improved monthly estimates of unemployment. And the Census Bureau will use the ACS data, along with the Current Population Survey data and administrative records, to improve poverty estimates for school districts.         Data for Small Areas      The fact that the ACS sample size and design will not provide data for the smallest areas until 2008 has led some to raise the concern that the ACS may be treating rural areas and urban census tracts unfairly.  The Census Bureau takes this concern very seriously.  Indeed, we wish it were possible to begin providing small areas with high quality, current data right away.  But that would basically require replicating the decennial long form every year, and that is not acceptable in terms of costs or burden on respondents.  Once again, we are faced with balancing competing demands.      But the Census Bureau takes even the perception that small areas are being treated unfairly very seriously and has worked with data experts to allay those concerns.  For example, the Census Bureau contracted with WESTAT to bring together rural experts and get their suggestions for improving the ACS from the perspective of rural areas.  The group of a dozen experts, who met in May 1998, expressed strong support for the ACS and we are pursuing their suggestions for further research and changes that might make the ACS even more valuable to rural areas.      At last year's hearing, you heard from Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson; Ms. Barbara Welty, representing the National Association of Towns and Townships; and Mr. Chuck Fluharty, Director of the Rural Policy Research Institute, on this issue and about the importance of having current data to support rural policy initiatives.  If I may quote from Mr. Fluharty's statement last year:       ""While some statistical limitations for rural areas within the American Community Survey may exist, the more timely, cost-effective multi-year estimates produced by ACS are far superior to existing data produced by the decennial Census.""      And this is the key point--even the smallest areas will have data 4 years earlier than they would if we had no ACS and included a long form in the 2010 Census.        So while concerns have been raised about data for small areas, the Census Bureau is confident that the current ACS design yields a major improvement over the existing situation.  We need to understand that the glass is more than half full and to fill it all the way would require unacceptable trade-offs in terms of costs and respondent burden.        Data for Small Population Groups      We have designed the American Community Survey to provide the same quality data as Census 2000 for all groups, regardless of size, and we plan to monitor the survey to ensure that this is the case.  As noted earlier, the ACS does not count the population; it estimates their characteristics.  To get accurate measurements, we need high response rates from all groups.      We have devoted considerable time to discussing the question of data for small population groups with our Race and Ethnic Advisory Committees.  We are evaluating their suggestions, together with our experiences collecting data from these groups in Census 2000.      Working closely with them, we will focus on techniques and strategies to ensure that small population groups participate in the survey.  We are exploring using language assistance guides similar to those used in Census 2000; revising the mailing package to elicit a better mail response rate; and placing public service announcements in newspapers and electronic media serving minority populations.        The permanent staff of field representatives will establish ongoing relationships with the communities they are working in, thereby enhancing trust and willingness to participate.      Timely and Relevant Data to Manage Federal and Local Programs      We believe that the American Community Survey is the cornerstone of the government's effort to keep pace with the country's ever-increasing demands for timely and relevant household data.  If we are to continue leadership in providing information to the knowledge society, we must invest in full development of the ACS.  In our web-based society of the 21 st  century, it is no longer acceptable that planners and policy-makers must use data that are up to 12 years out of date.      Eliminating the long form from the once-a-decade census will give us an incredible head-start toward having a successful 2010 Census at a reasonable cost.  Over the years, the long form included in the decennial census has met the Nation's need for detailed data essential for governing, by providing reliable, consistent data for small geographic areas once a decade.  To eliminate the long form without an alternative method of collecting detailed population and housing characteristics would leave the Nation with a knowledge void at a time when timely and accurate information is required to design and manage federal programs and distribute federal funds fairly.      Without an appropriate alternative to the decennial census long form--the ACS--Congress would not have the data to run the programs it has written into law.  It would not have a rudder to guide the ship of state.      The ACS will provide timely data to help the Congress, federal program managers, and the ""end users"" in every community in America.  It recognizes the continuing roles of the Congress and federal agencies, while also elevating the importance of partnerships with other levels of government and those directly affected by the decisions based on data.  Data collected by the ACS will help Congress evaluate and modify federal programs and will provide up-to-date information for congressional districts and states, as well as smaller areas, enabling services to be targeted to maximize the impact of available resources  at all levels of government.  The ACS will provide a critical new source of data that will allow the Congress to evaluate programs below the state level and determine accountability.  When fully implemented, it will collect data in every county, American Indian reservation, Alaskan Native area, and Hawaiian homeland, as well as Puerto Rico. Because data from the ACS will be available every year, Congress can determine change over time and measure the results of federal programs.  It means greatly improved annual estimates of population and housing characteristics and how they change over time.  The up-to-date estimates from the ACS will benefit, for example, welfare reform, funding for educationally disadvantaged children, and programs for the elderly.      The welfare reform legislation provides performance bonuses to states.  In some cases, no data are currently available to measure the results of state programs.  The ACS will collect the information about income and family structure that is needed to measure poverty and eligibility for benefits, as well as age, marital status, the presence of children, and educational attainment and school enrollment.  In addition, it will shed light on the results of state and local welfare-to-work initiatives.      The American Community Survey dramatically improves poverty estimates for groups such as children and the elderly, and provides current information on changes in family structure.   The Department of Education currently uses the estimates of poverty for children from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program in allocating annually over           $8 billion in Title I funds to school districts. The ACS will dramatically improve these estimates for school districts.  The ""Leave No Child Behind Act of 2001,"" currently under consideration in the Congress, specifically mentions the ACS as the source of data on the number of children with limited English proficiency--data to be used in administering grants to the States.      The ACS provides information about all age groups, including the current elderly population and the characteristics of people nearing retirement age.  This information is essential for projections about the needs and resources of people who are eligible to enter the retirement system and can help target screening programs for particular health conditions.      While I have focused on federal uses of the data today, the American Community Survey is providing current data from 21 of its 31 test sites to address real-life issues in rural and urban communities, and I think it's important to mention just a few illustrations of local uses.         A sparsely populated, rural county--Fulton County, Pennsylvania--is using the ACS data to develop an employment and training services system, a rural transportation system, and a ""Help Line"" for families to address health care and child care needs.          Bronx County, New York, will use ACS data to identify and develop intervention strategies for juvenile diabetes in special populations.        In Springfield, Massachusetts, community leaders and public safety officials are using ACS data to develop a youth violence prevention program for teens.        These are just a few examples of how having up-to-date information, instead of information that is 12 years old, will allow communities to provide services more efficiently.  ACS data are also being used to help localities meet federal program requirements.        Multnomah County, Oregon, will use ACS data as a source for enrollment forecasts that are used to justify support under various school programs.  In addition, Multnomah County used 1996 ACS data for a study of students who were in poverty, a critical input to several federal programs. And ACS data on the number and demographic characteristics of children and families receiving services are being used by the county to develop Head Start Community Assessment reports.       Next month, the we plan to issue additional data from the 21 test sites and national and state-level data from the nationwide operational test that collected data from a national sample of about 700,000 households.  We conducted this test--the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey--to ensure that the ACS can be conducted separately from, but during the same period as, a once-a-decade census.      Developing American Community Survey Content      In conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, we have established a jointly chaired Interagency Committee charged with balancing respondent burden with the legitimate information needs of the Congress and the federal government.  The Interagency Committee is working on reviewing the content of the ACS in a process similar to what we've done for the decennial census long form.  OMB has asked relevant federal departments and agencies to document legal requirements for data, the level of geography needed, and for what population groups.  This information is expected to be complete by the end of August.        For 2003, we anticipate the questionnaire will be similar to the current ACS questionnaire.  Since the survey is designed to produce 5-year estimates, we believe the content should remain reasonably consistent over time.  We would plan to submit to the Congress in 2006 the revised content of the 2008 questionnaires, following the decennial model.  In the interim, and through the Interagency Committee, all questions will be reviewed, those no longer required will be dropped, others can be re-worded and tested, and congressionally mandated topics can be added.      There was considerable discussion of the long form last year as an ""invasion of privacy.""  This was partly because the long form was administered to about 20 million housing units all at one time.  The American Community Survey provides a different atmosphere and will reduce public concern about intrusiveness.        Instead of about 20 million housing units receiving the census long form all at one time, in each monthly survey, only 250,000 housing units will receive the ACS questionnaire at any one time.  This is 1 in every 480 households in any given month.  In any given year, only 1 in 40 households, or about 2.5 percent of the total, will receive the ACS questionnaire.        Instead of having a large army of temporary enumerators, the ACS field interviewers will be highly trained permanent staff who will be better prepared to deal with the public's questions about the form.  Our experience thus far with the ACS has been that our trained interviewers have achieved good cooperation with few complaints from the public.  They can explain that the confidentiality of the data is strongly protected, they are used only for statistical purposes--not for regulation or law enforcement--and each questionnaire item is linked to a federal program.       Having said that, the Census Bureau takes questions and concerns about intrusiveness and privacy seriously.  We are aware of the time pressures confronting people and of the concerns we all have about privacy and confidentiality.  We also recognize and respect those who have philosophical objections to government activities, government programs, and government data collection.  In fact, the Census Bureau has a 60-year history--going back to the 1940 census--of working to reduce the number of questions and the number of households that would have to answer the longer set of questions.  Before 1940, everyone was asked the ""long form"" questions; that year, some of the questions were asked of only one-in-four people.  For the 1960 Census,  the percentage of households that received the long form was still one-in-four, but this was reduced to one-in-six by the 1980 Census.  And in Census 2000, the short form was reduced to seven items--the shortest in 180 years.  Weighed against the ever increasing demands for new questions, including requests from the Congress, this is evidence of the Census Bureau's sensitivity to this issue.      Conclusion      In summary, Mr. Chairman, as part of the strategy to re-engineer the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey will improve the way we take the census by eliminating the long form, simplifying the 2010 Census requirements, and allowing the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on the basic count.  It will provide more frequent detailed data for all geographic areas regardless of size, so that the Congress and federal agencies will have up-to-date information to administer and evaluate programs.  And it will contribute to a more efficient statistical system and allow us to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.      That concludes my testimony and I will now be happy to answer any questions."

HOT TIP  Can I find out from the Census Bureau how much of a particular product is sold by a particular kind of business establishment? For example, how much of the total sales of tobacco products is done by gas stations? Can I get this info for my state?  Yes, yes! The Census Bureau releases this information in our Merchandise Line Sales, one of the data series from the 1997 Economic Census. In January, we released the national report for retail trade (see RECENTLY RELEASED) and next month we'll release national, state, and metro data on CD-ROM along with a host of other substate data (see UPCOMING RELEASES). Incidentally, gas stations (including those with convenience stores) accounted for 37 percent of tobacco sales; supermarkets and grocery stores accounted for 24 percent; vending machines, less than 1 percent. Total tobacco sales? you ask. Approximately $37 billion in 1997.   BOOKMARK THIS!  Key Economic Indicators.

GX026-93-3565540	"Scientific Data Documentation       Master Area Reference File 2 (1980)       *SEE AREA REFERENCE FILE 2 DATASET NAMES FOR DSNs.   ABSTRACT    Summary   The Master Area Reference File (MARF) is the 1980 census counterpart of the  Master Enumeration District List (MEDList) prepared for the 1970 census.  It  links State or State equivalent, county or county equivalent, minor civil  division (MCD)/census county division (CCD), and place names with their  respective geographic codes.  It is also an abbreviated summary file  containing selected population and housing unit counts.   The second version of MARF (MARF 2) has the same geographic coverage as the  first MARF and includes the following additional information:  FIPS place  codes, latitude, and longitude coordinates for geographic areas down to the  BG/ED level, land area in square miles for geographic areas down to the  level of places or minor civil divisions (11 selected States) with a  population of 2,500 or more, total population and housing count estimates  based on sample returns, and per capita income for all geographic areas  included in the file.   Like the first version of MARF, MARF 2 will be available on a State-by-State  basis.   MARF 2 contains numeric codes and names for census geographic areas plus  100-percent and sample data for selected population and housing items.  The  file provides 100-percent counts for the total population, 5 race groups  (White, Black, American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, Asian and Pacific Islander, Other  races), persons of Spanish origin, families, persons in group quarters, one-  person households, and total, occupied, and owner-occupied housing units.  In addition, total population and housing unit estimates and per capita  income based on 1980 census sample returns are included.  Latitude and  longitude coordinates are given for the approximate population centroid of  each geographic area down to the level of block group (BG) and enumeration  district (ED).  Land area in square miles is provided for geographic areas  down to the level of places and minor civil divisions (MCDs) (in 11 selected  States) with a population of 2,500 or more.

These maps are referred to as the Metropolitan Map     Series (MMS) when the maps cover standard metropolitan statistical areas     (SMSA's) and as the Vicinity Map Series (VMS) when the maps cover areas     not in an SMSA.  For a more detailed discussion of the MMS/VMS, see the     section in the technical documentation entitled ""1980 Census Maps.""      County Maps.  The maps cover all counties and county equivalents except     where the Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map Series (MMS/VMS) sheets     cover an entire county.  Most county maps are based on maps supplied by     State transportation or highway departments on which the Bureau has     superimposed boundaries and identifiers for most areas for which data     are tabulated.  Insets to county maps are provided for some counties     that contain American Indian reservations.  For a more detailed     discussion on county maps, see the section in the technical     documentatio entitled ""1980 Census Maps.""      Place Maps.  Place maps are used for places not shown on MMS/VMS, and     show map features within the corporate limits of a municipality or     within boundaries established for a census designated place (CDP).  If     census boundaries and identifiers for an area adjacent to a place are     shown, the map is referred to as a place-and-vicinity map.

This file set includes data     shown in the sample tables of the PHC80-3 reports.  Files A and C     provide data for the same areas as files A and C of STF 1, excluding     blocks.  STF files 3A and 3C have been released.  These files are also     available on microfiche.  File 3B, a special tabulation contracted for     by a private organization, provides summaries for each 5-digit ZIP code     area within States, standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's),     and counties.  STF files 3D, 3F, and 3G provide data for the same     geographic areas as the corresponding STF 1 files.  Most State STF 3D     files are available.  STF 3F and STF 3G files are being released on a     State-by-State basis.      STF 4 (Files A, B, and C) is the geographic counterpart of STF 2 and     contains approximately 8,500 cells of population and housing data, of     which approximately 3,500 are repeated for up to 39 race, Spanish     origin, and ancestry groups present in the tabulation area.  Data are     summarized for areas similar to those shown for STF 2, except that data     for places are limited to those with 2,500 or more inhabitants.  This     file set includes data shown in the PHC80-2, PHC80-1C, and HC80-1-B     reports.  STF 4A and B files are being released on a State-by-State     basis.      STF 5 (Files A and C) contains over 100,000 cells of population and     housing data estimated from the sample and provides highly detailed     tabulations for States, standard metropolitan statistical areas     (SMSA's), and counties and places of 50,000 or more inhabitants.  Most     subjects are cross-classified by five race and Spanish origin groups.     This file set includes data shown in the PC80-1-D and HC80-2 reports.     STF 5 is scheduled to be available in late 1983.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Geographic Identification Code     Scheme.  The file lists names and numeric codes for States, counties,     county subdivisions (MCD's/CCD's), and places for which 1980 census data     were tabulated.  It includes much of the information from the PHC80-R5     Geographic Identification Code Scheme report.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Equal Employment Opportunity     (EEO) Special File.  The file contains two tables.  Table 1 provides     detailed occupation (514 categories) by sex.  Table 2 contains years of     school completed by age and sex.  The data in both tables are     cross-classification by sex and Hispanic origin or race for     non-Hispanics.  These data are provided for States, the District of     Columbia, standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's), counties,     and places with a population of 50,000 or more.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Public-Use Microdata Samples.     Public-use microdata samples are computerized files containing records     for a sample of housing units, with information on the characteristics     of each unit and the persons in it.  These files do not contain names or     addresses, and geographic identification is sufficiently broad to     protect confidentiality.  There are three mutually exclusive samples     (each released by State, groups of States, or for the U.S.):  the A     sample including 5 percent, and the B and C samples each including 1     percent of all persons and housing units.  Three 1-in-1,000 samples were     also prepared, one each extracted from the A, B, and C samples.  Each     sample features a different geographic scheme.  The A sample focuses on     States, the B on SMSA's, and the C samples gives urban/rural components     for regions and divisions and identifies UA's.  Separate sets of county     groups are featured on the A and B samples.  Microdata files allow the     user to prepare customized tabulations.  All state files have been     released.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  P.L. 94-171 Population Counts.     The file, organized by State, provides count for total population, and     provisional counts for five racial categories and Spanish/Hispanic     origin.  Summaries are provided for the State, counties, minor civil     divisions (MCD's) or census county divisions (CCD's), incorporated     places or place segments within MCD's/CCD's, remainder of MCD's/CCD's,     election precincts in certain States or portions of certain States,     census tracts or block numbering areas, block groups and blocks or, for     areas that are not block numbered, enumeration districts (ED's).  The     figures presented in P.L. 94-171 may differ from those shown in STF 1.     The changes reflect corrections of errors found after P.L. 94-171 was     prepared.  Microfiche (and paper photo copy of microfiche) of the P.L.     94-171 Population Counts file is also available.      Census Software Package (CENSPAC).  CENSPAC is a generalized data     retrieval system developed by the Census Bureau for use with Census     Bureau statistical data files.  CENSPAC provides file processing     capabilities primarily for summary data files, but also provides some     features which apply to microdata files.  A manual describing the     software accompanies each file order ($140 from Customer Services     (Tapes) or may be purchased separately from Customer Services for $5.00.

File Structure and Geographic Coverage   For each geographic area presented on MARF, there is a 390-character census  logical record.  Each record begins with 252 characters of geographic  information and suppression indicators.  For a concise description of the  geographic coverage of MARF 2 see Appendix A.   Figure 1 presents an overview of the sequencing of records in MARF.  Although variations such as places split by minor civil divisions (MCD's),  MCD's which both have block numbering areas (BNA's) and unblocked areas, and  census tracts with both block groups (BC's) and enumeration distrits (ED's)  are not shown, these variations are explained in the following discussion of  each summary level record type appearing in MARF.   The State record (Summary Level 04) contains a summary for the State or  State equivalent.   The county record (Summary Level 11) contains a summary for each county or  county equivalent, including independent cities, within the State in FIPS  code sequence.   The minor civil division (MCD) / census county division (CCD) record  (Summary Level 12) contains a summary for each MCD/CCD within the county in  census code sequence.   The place or remainder-of-MCD/CCD record (Summary Level 13) provides a  summary for each place within the MCD/CCD in census place code sequence.   These may be places or, when places cross MCD/CCD boundaries, portions of  places.  A remainder-of-MCD/CCD record will be generated only if there is a  place in the MCD/CCD.  This record will cover all areas outside of places  and will have a pseudo place code of 9999.

When an area is tracted and block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each tract or tract portion within the MCD/CCD/place or      remainder of MCD/CCD.  Each tract summary is followed by a summary for      each BG within the tract or tract portion.  Tract summaries are in tract      code sequence, and BG summaries are sequenced by the BG number.   B.  Tract/BG/ED.  When a MCD/CCD is tracted and partially block-numbered,      there will be both BG and ED summaries for the tract or tract portion      within the MCD/CCD/place or remainder of MCD/CCD.  BG summaries will      precede those for ED's.  BG summaries are sequenced by BG numbers, and      ED summaries are sequenced by ED number and suffix.   C.  Tract/ED.  When an area is tracted but not block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each tract or tract portion within the MCD/CCD/place or      remainder.  Each tract summary is followed by the summary for each ED      within the tract or BNA portion.   D.  BNA/BG.  When an area is not tracted but is block-numbered, there will      be a summary for each BNA portion within the MCD/CCD/place or remainder,      followed by a summary for each BG within the BNA or BNA portion.   E.  Pseudo BNA/ED.  When the remainder of an untracted MCD/CCD is partially      blocked, the blocked portion will be shown as in D above and the      unblocked portion will be shown by a pseudo BNA (999999) followed by the      summary for each ED in the area.   F.  ED.  When an area is neither tracted nor block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each ED within the place, place segment, or MCD/CCD.  ED records      for the portion of MCD's/CCD's not covered by places will follow the      remainder of MCD/CCD summary record, if applicable.     DESCRIPTION OF POPULATION   Universe description =  All persons and housing units in the United States.    SUPPRESSION    Introduction  To maintain the confidentiality promised respondents and required by law,  the Census Bureau takes precautions to make sure that its public data, in  print or on tape, do not disclose information about particular individuals  or housing units; therefore the Bureau suppresses tabulations of  characteristics for very small groups of people or housing units.  On  summary tapes, zeroes are entered in suppressed cells.  However, a zero in a  cell does not automatically mean suppression.  Only by checking the  suppression flag field can it be determined if the zero in a specific item  is suppressed data or an actual count of zero.   The following discussion outlines the rules for suppression of  complete-count and sample data as it applies to the subject items on MARF2.    No Suppression   No Suppression   The following counts are never suppressed:                      Total population                     Total housing units                     Occupied housing units                     Count of persons and households in each race and                       Spanish origin group    Primary Suppression   Primary Suppression   Suppression of Population Characteristics.  Characteristics of persons other  than race or Spanish origin are shown only if the number of persons in a  geographic area meets minimum requirements.  For tabulations based on  complete-count data (e.g., number of persons in group quarters), there must  be 15 or more persons in the geographic area.  For tabulations based on  sample estimates (e.g., per capita income), there must be 30 or more persons  in the geographic area.   Suppression of Family, Household, or Occupied Housing Characteristics.  Characteristics of families, households, or occupied housing units are shown  if there are five or more occupied housing units within the geographic area  tabulated.   Suppression of Owner or Renter Characteristics.  Distributions of data for  owners or renters are shown when the number of owners is five or more and  the number of renters is also five or more.  Programming with Suppression   Suppressed data cells contain zeroes.  To distinguish between zeroes as  suppression and zeroes as valid data, occurrences of suppression are  identified by a series of flag fields in the geographic identification  portion of each logical record.  Programmers developing software should  include procedures to check these fields for the presence of suppression  and, if necessary, to flag the output of any cumulation which includes one  or more suppressed fields.   In reviewing the data dictionary, the programmer can determine which  suppression flags indicate suppression for particular items by checking  either the item description or the flag description.     DATA DICTIONARY (RECORD LAYOUT)    How to Use the Data Dictionary (Record Layout)   This computer-generated report documents the data contents and the record  layout of the file.  Below is a brief description of the information  provided for each data item.   The first line of each data item description gives the name, size/scale,  begin position, and the variable label.  Following those items, on  subsequent lines, are any applicable notes and value codes.  Each of these  items is defined below.       1.  Name.  This is an arbitrarily assigned 8 character identifier.  It          may be a mnemonic such as ""STATE"" or ""EDNUMBER"", or sequential          identifiers such as ""SUPFLO1"", ""SUPFLO2"", etc.       2.  Size/Scale.  The size of a data item is given in characters.  The          scale of a data item is given in integer powers of 10.  Implied          decimals or multipliers (in integer powers of ten only) are          indicated by a ""-"" or a ""+"" followed by a number.  For example,          123.45 would appear on the data tape as 12345, and the size/scale          value would be 5/-2.  A number recorded in thousands (12,345,000 for          example) would appear on the data tape as 12345 and the size/scale          value would be 5/+3.  Scale factors which are not an integer power          of ten are identified in the notes following the label, and in the          footnotes.       3.  Begin.  This is the location in the data record of the first          character of the data item.       4.  Data Type.  The type ""A"" indicates that the data item is represented          by an alphabetic or numeric code; ""N"" indicates that an actual          figure is provided.       5.  Description.  Following the Data Type is a description of the data          item.  This heading is not labeled on the data dictionary.  This          section also provides any relevant notes or footnote references.  In          addition, any value codes necessary for the data item are listed and          labeled here.   Note:  Since the standard geographic identification format for 1980 census  summary tapes is used on the MARF 2 file, all geographic identifiers are  included in the MARF 2 data dictionary.  However, the description indicates  if the identifier is not applicable to MARF 2.

BUREAU OF CENSUS PRODUCT REVIEW Summary Tape Files   Computer-readable data from the 1980 census include both summary data and  microdata.  Summary data include Summary Tape Files (STF's) 1 to 5, which  are generally comparable to the First Count through Sixth Count files from  the 1970 census.  In addition to the files in the STF series, other summary  data released by the Bureau include a P.L. 94-171 Population Counts file  used in reapportionment/redistricting, the Master Area Reference file which  provides geographic items from STF 1 and selected population and housing  items, and the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Special File containing  two tables, one on detailed occupation by sex and another on years of school  completed by age and sex.  All of these files contain data summarized to  various levels of geography.  Microdata files, on the other hand, contain  disclosure-free household and person records from the census.  These are  similar to the 1970 census public use sample files.   Summary Tape Files vary by level of geography, detail of information, and  whether they include 100-percent or sample data.  STF's 1 and 2 provide data  based on the set of census questions asked of all persons and housing  units.  STF's 3, 4, and 5 contain sample data or estimates based on the  responses of a sample of population and housing units.  In 1980, the  sampling rate was 1 in 2 in governmental units estimated to have less than  2,500 inhabitants and 1 in 6 elsewhere.  Overall, the sampling rate was  approximately 1 in 5.  The bureau's 1977 population estimates were used to  determine the sampling rate for a given area.   STF 1 provides the maximum possible geographic detail available from the  census:  data for individual blocks in block-numbered areas and for  enumeration districts outside block-numbered areas.  The lowest level of  geography provided by STF 2 is the census tract, or minor civil  division/census county division (MCD/CCD) and places of 1,000 or more  inhabitants in nontracted areas.  The lowest level for STF 3 is the block  group or enumeration district, while the smallest geographic unit for STF 4  is the census tract, or MCD/CCD and places of 2,500 or more inhabitants in  nontracted areas.  STF 5 contains summaries for States, standard  metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's), SMSA central cities, other places  of 50,000 or more inhabitants, and counties of 50,000 or more inhabitants.   STF's 1 to 5 each consist of multiple files, each file featuring specific  levels of geography.  Figure 3 details the geographic levels on each STF.   For comparison purposes, STF 1 is similar in subject matter and geographic  detail to the First and Third Count files for 1970.  STF's 2 and 4 are  roughly comparable to the 1970 Second and Fourth Counts, respectively.  STF  3 is comparable to the 1970 Fifth Count, while STF 5 corresponds to the 1970  Sixth Count.

To determine which maps best define the  different geographic areas, compare the geographic coverage of each file  (see Appendix A) with the description of each type of 1980 census map (see  below).   There are five basic map types used in conjunction with the summary tape  files:  county maps, place maps, place-and-vicinity maps, American Indian  reservation maps, and Metropolitan Map Series (MMS) or Vicinity Map Series  (VMS).  Ordering information for these maps may be obtained from Data User  Services Division, Customer Services (Maps), Bureau of the Census,  Washington, D.C.   20233.   All five map types have several characteristics in common:       --To improve legibility, most 1980 maps are at a larger scale than          were the comparable 1970 maps.       --Symbols used for the various boundaries are consistent for all          five types of maps.       --Names, identifying numbers, and boundaries are shown where          appropriate on all maps for counties and equivalent entities, minor          civil divisions (MCD's) or census county divisions (CCD's), places,          American Indian reservations and Alaska Native villages, census          tracts or block numbering areas (BNA's) where present, enumeration          districts (ED's) (in those areas which are not block numbered), and          blocks.       --All maps show metric, feet, and mile scales.       --All maps containing block-numbered areas are available from the          U.S. Government Printing Office.   The following paragraphs present a brief description of each type of census  map.    County Maps  County maps are the backbone of the Bureau's map coverage.  Theoretically, with a complete set of these maps the overall picture of the  census geographic framework for the entire United States and its possessions  is shown.  Most maps in the county series are at a scale of 1 inch:1 mile.  Most county maps are created by superimposing boundaries for most areas for  which data are tabulated on base maps supplied by State transportation or  highway departments.  There are approximately 5,500 county map sheets for  1980.  The following geographic area boundaries are defined on county maps  where appropriate:  State, county, minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census  county divisions (CCD's), places, American Indian reservations, census  tracts or block numbering areas (BNA's), and enumeration districts (ED's) or  numbered blocks.  In addition, the locations of Alaska Native villages are  indicated.  Counties which are totally covered by Metropolitan Map Sheets  (MMS) do not have separate county maps.    Place Maps   For places not covered on MMS or VMS sheets where most of the  development is contained within the corporate limits of a municipality or  within the boundaries established for a census designated place (CDP), the  Bureau uses place maps.  The scale of the place maps varies from place to  place.  As with the county maps, most are created by superimposing  boundaries for most areas for which data are tabulated on base maps supplied  by local or State governments.  On the county map, shading is added to  indicate the area covered by the place map; i.e., the place map is regarded  as an inset to the county map.  There are about 11,800 place map sheets for  1980.  The geographic area boundaries defined on place maps are the same as  for county maps.    Place-and-Vicinity Maps   For places not covered on MMS or VMS sheets which  have areas of development outside the corporate limits of a municipality or  outside the boundaries established for a CDP, the Bureau uses  place-and-vicinity maps.  Also included in this category are maps of places  which have parcels of land that are not part of the city but are completely  surrounded by the city and where two or more places appear on the same map  sheet.  In all other respects, place-and-vicinity maps have the same  characteristics as place maps.  As with the place maps, all area covered by  the place-and-vicinity map is shaded on the county map and the  place-and-vicinity map is considered to be an inset to the county map.  There are about 4,500 place-and-vicinity map sheets for 1980.  The  geographic area boundaries defined on these maps are the same as those  specified for the county maps.    Indian Reservation Maps   The Census Bureau developed separate maps for 20  American Indian reservations which could not be depicted adequately on  county Maps; these maps are similar in format to county maps.  There are  approximately 100 American Indian reservation maps and these maps are  special insets to the county maps.  The geographic area boundaries defined  on these maps are the same as those specified for the county maps.    Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map Series (MMS/VMS)   For the Nation's major built-up areas, the Bureau has developed its own maps  to provide uniform coverage of the densely settled portions of the counties  involved. these maps are referred to as the Metropolitan Map Series (MMS)  when the maps cover SMSA counties and as the Vicinity Map Series (VMS) when  the maps cover areas which are not in an SMSA.  The predominant scale for the  MMS and VMS is 1 inch:1,600 feet.  In selected areas with very dense  development, some sheets are at 1 inch:800 feet; conversely, some sparsely  settled areas are mapped at 1 inch:3,200 feet.  The MMS and VMS are  considered to be insets to the county maps and the areas covered by MMS and  VMS are shaded on county maps.  There are about 10,400 MMS and VMS sheets for  1980.  (In a few instances, these map sheets entirely cover a county, in  which case no separate county map exists.)  The geographic area boundaries  defined on the MMS are the same as those specified for county maps, but also  include urbanized areas.   In addition to the five types of ""outline"" maps described above, there are a  number of maps that are prepared and published as part of the various report  series.  As was the case with the maps previously described, the maps  included in the printed reports share common characteristics.  Both metric  and mile scales are shown.  Map scale and content are similar to 1970 except  where noted below; however, presentation has been improved to make the maps  more readable and consistent from series to series.   The County Subdivision Map Series consists of at least one map page for each  State showing the names and boundaries for the State, each component county  or equivalent entity, minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census county  divisions (CCD's), and all places, both incorporated and census designated.  For most States, the scale of the maps requires that they be presented in  sections.  For 1980, the boundaries (not just the locations) of places with  fewer than 2,500 inhabitants are shown for the first time.  In addition, the  name(s) of adjoining State(s) are shown along with a mark to indicate where  the State boundaries intersect.  These maps, which are based on the State  base maps of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Mapping Program  appear in PC80-1-A.  Single-sheet versions of the county subdivision map  series are published at the USGS scale of 1:500,000 (1 inch equals about 8  miles) for most States except Alaska and the outlying areas, and may be  fitted together to form multi-State maps.  For those States in which  American Indian reservations or Alaska Native villages are located, a  special version of the county subdivision map showing these entities appears  in PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A.   The Urbanized Area Outline Map Series consists of one or more map sheets for  each urbanized area (UA) defined on the basis of 1980 census results.  The  names and boundaries of all States, counties, MCD's/CCD's, and places on  each map are shown, plus the extent of territory defined as ""urbanized.""  These maps appear in PC80-1-A and HC80-1-A.  In 1980, the report for each  State containing part of a multi-State UA includes the map for the entire UA.   The State SCSA/SMSA Map Series shows county names and boundaries, names and  locations of all places with a population of 25,000 or more or designated as  the central city of an SMSA, and names and boundaries of standard  consolidated statistical areas (SCSA's) and standard metropolitan  statistical areas (SMSA's) in the State.  For 1980, the name of the capital  of the State is underlined.  These maps appear in PC80-1-A, B, C, D;  HC80-1-A, B; and HC80-2.   The Census Tract Outline Map Series covers each of the areas for which  tracts have been defined in 1980.  These maps show the boundaries and code  identification number for each tract; the names of streets or other features  used as census tract boundaries; and the names and boundaries for counties,  MCD/CCD's, and all places (not just those over 25,000 as in 1970).  Street  detail within the tracts is not shown.  Separate insets of larger scale than  the base maps are included for densely developed areas; however, fewer  insets are used than in 1970.  Scale varies from map to map.  For 1980,  tract outline maps were prepared for tracted counties outside SMSA's.  These  maps are published in PHC80-2 Census Tracts (Maps) and should appear  slightly ahead of the printed reports, PHC80-2 Census Tracts.   Map sets were printed for all block-numbered areas, grouped by SMSA and the  nonSMSA remainder of each State.  In addition to printed copies of the  county, place, place-and-vicinity, and Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map  Series (MMS/VMS) sheets having block-numbered areas, there is an index map  depicting the extent of the block-numbered area for the SMSA and State.  The  SMSA Index to Block-Numbered Areas Maps show the extent of the SMSA; county,  MCD/CCD, and place names and boundaries; and the extent of block-numbered  area within the SMSA shown by means of shading.  The State Index to  Block-Numbered Areas Maps were prepared by superimposing the extent of all  block-numbered areas in the State over the county subdivision map.  This  index map also shows the boundaries of the SMSA(s) in the State so that the  reader can determine whether the data for any block-numbered area in the  State are available with the SMSA tabulations or the remainder-of-State  tabulations.     SAMPLING AN NONSAMPLING ERRORS   Certain numbers in this file (per capita income, estimates of total persons  and housing units) are based on a sample of questionnaire responses.  These  data are estimates of the actual figures that would have resulted from a  complete count and can be expected to vary from the complete-count result.  These estimates contain some amount of chance error and are subject to  sampling variability as well as nonsampling error.  A detailed discussion of  the 1980 census sample design and of the sample variability of these  estimates may be found in Appendix D of any PC80-1-C report, General Social  and Economic Characteristics of the Population.  In general, sample  estimates of total population and housing units will differ from the  corresponding complete census counts for geographic areas not composed of  entire counties.  When summed to the county level, however, these counts  should agree.   The remaining 1980 census population and housing counts shown in this file  were tabulated from the entries for persons on all questionnaires, these  counts are not subject to sampling error.  However, in any large-scale  statistical operation such as a decennial census, human and mechanical  errors do occur.  These errors are commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors.  Such errors include failure to include every household or person in  the universe, not obtaining all required information from respondents,  obtaining incorrect or inconsistent information, and recording information  incorrectly.  Errors can also occur during the field review of the  enumerators' work, the clerical handling of the census questionnaires, or  the electronic processing of the questionnaires.   In an attempt to reduce various types of nonsampling errors in the 1980  census, a number of techniques were introduced on the basis of experience in  previous censuses and in tests conducted prior to the census.  These quality  control and review measures were utilized throughout the data collection and  processing phases of the census to reduce undercoverage of the population  and housing units and to keep the errors at a minimum.  As was done after  the 1950, 1960, and 1970 censuses, there were programs at the conclusion of  the 1980 census to measure various aspects of the quality achieved in the  census.  Reports on many aspects of the 1980 census evaluation program will  be published as soon as the appropriate data are accumulated and analyzed.   A major component of the evaluation work is to ascertain, insofar as  possible, the degree of completeness of the count of persons and housing  units.  The Census Bureau has estimated that the 1970 census did not count  2.5 percent of the population.  For 1980, the Census Bureau's extensive  evaluation program encompassed a number of different approaches to the task  of estimating the coverage of the census.  Although these studies have not  been completed, at the time of this file's release, preliminary estimates  indicate that the rate of undercoverage in the 1980 census was reduced from  1970 census levels.     EDITING AND ALLOCATION OF DATA ITEMS   The objective of the census processing operation is to produce a set of  statistics that describes the population as accurately and clearly as  possible.  To meet this objective, certain unacceptable entries and blank  items were edited.   Editing.  In the field, questionnaires were reviewed for omissions and  certain inconsistencies by a census clerk or an enumerator and, if  necessary, a followup was made for missing information.  In addition, a  similar review of questionnaires was done in the central processing  offices.  As a rule, however, editing was performed by hand only when it  could not be done effectively by machine.   As one of the first steps in computerized editing, the configuration of  marks on the questionnaire column was scanned electronically to determine  whether it contained information for a person or merely spurious marks.  If  the column contained entries for at least two of the basic characteristics  (relationship, sex, race, age, marital status, Spanish origin), the  inference was made that the marks represented a person.  In cases in which  two or more basic characteristics were available for only a portion of the  people in the unit, other information on the questionnaire provided by an  enumerator was used to determine the total number of persons.  Names were  not used as a criterion of the presence of a person because the electronic  scanning was unable to distinguish an entry in the name space.   Allocation.  Allocations, or assignments of acceptable codes in place of  unacceptable entries, are needed most often when an entry for a given item  is lacking or when the information reported for a person or housing unit on  that item is inconsistent with other information for the person or housing  unit.  The usefulness of the data is considered to be enhanced through the  assignment of acceptable codes in place of blanks or unacceptable entries.   For housing data, the assignment is based on related information reported  for the housing unit or on information reported for a similar unit in the  immediate neighborhood.  For example, if tenure for an occupied unit is  omitted but a rental amount is reported for that unit, the computer edits  tenure to ""rented for cash rent.""  On the other hand, if the unit is  reported as rented but the amount of rent is missing, the computer assigns  the rent from the preceding renter-occupied unit that had a rental amount  reported.   The general procedure for changing unacceptable population entries is to  assign an entry for a person that is consistent with entries for other  persons with similar characteristics.  Thus, a person who is reported as a  20-year old son of the householder but for whom marital status is not  reported, is assigned the same marital status as that of the last son  processed in the same age group.  The allocation technique may be  illustrated by the procedure used in the assignment for an unknown age.  The  process is carried out in the following steps:       1.  The computer stores reported ages of persons by selected          characteristics, including sex, relationship, marital status, and          characteristics of other household members.       2.  Each stored age is retained in the computer only until a person          having the same set of characteristics and with age reported is          processed through the computer in the edit operation.  Then the age          of this succeeding person is substituted for the age previously          stored.       3.  When a person processed has no report of age, or the entry is          unacceptable, the age assigned to him or her is that which was          stored for the last person who otherwise has the same set of          characteristics.   Substitution.  The editing process also includes another type of correction,  namely the assignment of a full set of characteristics for a person or a  housing unit.  The assignment of the full set of housing characteristics  occurs when there is no housing information available.  If the housing unit  is determined to be occupied, the housing characteristics are assigned from  the previously processed occupied units.  If the housing unit is vacant, the  housing characteristics are assigned from the previously processed vacant  unit.   The assignment of a full set of characteristics for a person in a household  containing no information for all or most of the people, although persons  were known to be present, is done in the following manner.  A previously  processed household is selected as a substitute and the full set of  population characteristics for each substituted person is duplicated.  These  duplications fall into two classes:  (1) ""persons substituted due to  noninterview,"" e.g., a housing unit indicated as occupied but the occupants  are not listed on the questionnaire, and (2) ""persons substituted due to  mechanical failure,"" e.g., where the questionnaire page on which persons are  listed was not properly microfilmed.   The editing process ensures that the distribution of characteristics for  persons and housing units assigned by the computer corresponds closely to  the distribution of characteristics for persons and housing units actually  reported in the census.  Before the advent of the computer, this type of  process was not feasible and the distribution of characteristics to be used  for assignment purposes was drawn from the preceding census or another  source.   Specific tolerances are established for the number of computer allocations  and substitutions that are permitted.  If the number of corrections is  beyond tolerance, the questionnaires in which the errors occurred are  clerically reviewed.  If it is found that the errors resulted from damaged  questionnaires, from improper microfilming, from faulty reading by FOSDIC  (Film Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computers) of undamaged  questionnaires, or from other types of machine failure, the questionnaires  are reprocessed.     GLOSSARY    Introduction                               Concept Definitions   The following definitions were taken from the 1980 Census of Population and  Housing Users' Guide.  Since the items described here are only those which  appear in MARF 2, there may be references to other terms which are not  defined in this glossary.  A complete glossary is available in the Users'  Guide.    A-B   ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES.  Alaska Native villages constitute tribes, bands,  clans, groups, villages, communities, or associations in Alaska which were  listed in sections 11 and 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,  Public Law 92-203, or which met the requirements of the Act and which the  Secretary of Interior determined were, on the 1970 census enumeration date  (April 1), composed of 25 or more Alaska Natives.  This list was reviewed  and updated for the Census Bureau by the State of Alaska prior to the 1980  census, to specifically identify only those entities that were legally  recognized as Alaska Native villages.   Data summaries for Alaska Native villages are included in STF's 2B, 2C, 4B,  and 4C, and reports PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  Population and  housing counts for Alaska Native villages are scheduled to be included in a  supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  In addition, a population subject  report (PC80-2 series), featuring additional data on Alaska Native villages  is also planned.  Data for each Alaska Native village can be derived from  MARF, MARF 2, STF 1A, and STF 3A by identifying the component ED(s), and  summarizing the data should multiple ED's be involved.  (NOTE-  Eklutna  Native Village is in a blocked area; therefore, data can be derived from  block group (BG) summaries for the village.)  Each Alaska Native village has  been assigned a unique 3-digit code by the Bureau which appears in the  reservation code field.   Alaska Native villages will be identified on the Alaska subdivision maps in  the PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  Alaska Native villages are also shown on  Metropolitan Map Series, place, and county maps.  It should be noted that  Alaska Native villages do not have boundaries that are defined by legal  descriptions, and therefore the boundaries shown on the census maps are only  indicative of the approximate extent of a village; for those that correspond  to a city or census designated place, the limits of such places are  construed to coincide with the extent of the Alaska Native village.   Historical comparability:  Data are not available from previous censuses for  Alaska Native villages.  Some cities and ""unincorporated places"" (referred  to as ""census designated places"" in 1980) which were identified in the 1970  census may correspond to 1980 Alaska Native villages, but may not have  identical boundaries.

American Indian reservations are areas with  boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order.  The reservations and their boundaries were identified for the Census Bureau  by the bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and State governments.  Federal and  State reservations are located in 33 States and may cross State, county,  minor civil division/census county division, and place boundaries.  In  tabulations for reservations, tribal trust lands outside the boundaries of  reservations (off-reservation) are not included as part of the reservations  (see below).   Preliminary evaluation of the 1980 census data suggest that counts for a few  reservations may be subject to certain limitations or nonsampling errors.  Although the various field and computer operations undergo a number of  quality control checks to ensure accuracy of the data, available evidence  indicates that nonsampling errors are substantial for a small number of  reservations.  For example, a few reservations have a relatively high  substitution rate.  A listing of reservations where characteristics for 20  percent or more of the persons or housing units in the 1980 Census were  substituted are shown in PC80-1-B reports, Appendix D, ""Accuracy of the  Data.""  (For a fuller discussion of nonsampling errors, see the Users' Guide  chapter 6, ""Data Limitations,"" report appendixes on ""Accuracy of the Data,""  or the ""Technical Information"" section in tape technical documentation.)  Additional evaluation of the 100-percent counts for reservations is being  completed and a fuller explanation will be published in a 1980 census  supplementary report, series PC80-S1, ""Population and Housing Unit Counts  for American Indian Areas and Alaska Native Villages:  1980.""   Each American Indian reservation was assigned a unique 3-digit code by the  Bureau.  Enumeration districts (ED's) and block groups (BG's) which are  inside boundaries of reservations are designated with an ""N"" in the ED  prefix field in tape files.   Data summaries for American Indian reservations are included in STF's 2B,  2C, 4B, and 4C, and reports PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  Population  and housing counts for reservations are scheduled to be included in a  supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  Also, a population subject report  (PC80-2 series) presenting additional data on American Indian reservations  is also planned.  Summaries on tape and in PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A show data  not only for the reservation totals, but also for parts of reservations that  cross State or county boundaries.  Reservation data can also be derived from  MARF, MARF 2, STF 1A, and STF 3A by the addition of component ED or BG  summaries.  Maps outlining reservation boundaries are included in the  PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  Reservation boundaries are also shown on  Metropolitan Map Series, place, and county maps.   Historical comparability:  Data on 115 American Indian reservations were  published in the 1970 census subject report, American Indians, PC(2)-1F.  However, 1980 data may not be comparable to 1970 information because of  boundary changes, improvements in geographic identification, new enumeration  techniques, and other procedural changes made for the 1980 census.   AMERICAN INDIAN SUBRESERVATION AREAS.  Entities known as ""areas,""  ""chapters,"" ""districts,"" ""segments,"" or ""communities"" are associated with  some American Indian reservations and were identified for the Census Bureau  by tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  In a few  cases, such subreservation areas extend beyond reservation boundaries or are  located entirely outside the reservation (off-reservation.  American Indian  subreservations recognized for the 1980 census are identified by a unique  3-digit code.   Data for subreservations are not summarized in regular census tabulations;  however, subreservation data can be obtained from the Census Bureau on a  cost-reimbursable basis from a special tabulation.  (For further information  regarding subreservation areas, please write Population Division, Racial  Statistics Branch, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.  20233.)   Historical comparability:  American Indian subreservation areas were not  identified separately in previous censuses.   AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL TRUST LANDS.  Some American Indian reservations have  tribal trust lands in the vicinity of the reservation.  The Bureau of Indian  Affairs identified these areas for the 1980 census.  Tribal trust lands are  located outside the reservation boundary (off-reservation) and are  associated with a specific reservation.   Population and housing counts for tribal trust lands are scheduled to be  included in a supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  Additional information  for these areas may be included in special reports or unpublished  tabulations.  Also, such data can be obtained from the Census Bureau on a  cost-reimbursable basis from a special tabulation.  (For further information  regarding the geography for tribal trust lands, please write to Population  Division, Racial Statistics Branch, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.  20233.)   Historical comparability:  Tribal trust lands were not identified in  previous censuses.   AREA, LAND.  See LAND AREA.   ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION.  See RACE.   BARRIO.  See PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.   BLACK POPULATION.  See RACE.   BLOCK.  Normally a rectangular piece of land, bounded by four streets.  However, a block may also be irregular in shape or bounded by railroad  tracks, streams, or other features.  Blocks do not cross the boundaries of  counties, census tracts, or block numbering areas (BNA's).  They may cross  place boundaries and the boundaries of minor civil divisions (MCD's).  When  blocks cross place boundaries and, in 20 States (see figure 4, column 3)  when they cross MCD boundaries, separate statistical summaries are presented  for each part of the block.   Census blocks are normally compact units, but there are important  exceptions.  For example, in some suburbs, houses cluster around  cul-de-sacs.  In these areas a census block may be fairly large since only  those features that serve as the perimeter of an enclosed area are treated  as block boundaries.  Also, in those rural areas where they are numbered,  blocks may include many square miles, depending on the frequency of  intersections of roads, rivers, mountain ridges, or other physical features.   Census data are tabulated by block in all urbanized areas (UA's) and  generally for some territory extending beyond the UA boundaries.  Data also  are tabulated by block in incorporated places with 10,000 or more  inhabitants outside UA's, and in other areas which contracted with the  Census Bureau for the preparation of block statistics.  Places outside of  UA's are included in the block statistics program if they met the 10,000  population criterion in the 1970 census, in official Bureau estimates  through 1976, or in a special census taken on or before December 31, 1977.  Block coverage for qualifying places is within boundaries as of January 1,  1980.  Five States contracted for the preparation of block statistics for  all of their territory, both urban and rural, not already in the block  statistics program. These States are Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Rhode  Island, and Virginia.   A block is identified by a 3-digit code which is unique within census tract  or, where tracts do not exist, BNA.  Since separate summaries are provided  for the parts of a block split by a place boundary or, in 20 States, an MCD  boundary, tape users often will need to specify the place or MCD code, along  with other codes, to retrieve data for a block.  Blocks are defined on  detailed census maps:  Metropolitan Map Series (MMS), Vicinity Map Series  (VMS), place maps, and county maps.  The extent of block statistics coverage  is reflected on maps by the presence of the 3-digit block number and the  absence of ED boundaries and numbers.   On census maps, when a block boundary ignores a minor physical feature, such  as a railroad track, a ""fishhook"" (   ) across the feature indicates that  the block includes area on both sides of the feature.  Alternatively, the  separate parts of such a block may have identical block numbers, each  followed by an asterisk.   The maps used for enumeration activities were, of necessity, obtained  several years prior to the census and therefore do not reflect recently  constructed streets.  Only those features shown on the maps can serve as  block boundaries.   Statistics were collected for approximately 2.6 million blocks in the 1980  census.  Block statistics are included in PHC80-1 Block Statistics  microfiche series and in file B of Summary Tape File 1 (STF 1B).   Historical comparability:  In 1970 block statistics were prepared for UA's  (and some territory beyond) located in SMSA's existing at the time of the  census, as well for contract areas.  Unlike 1980, they were not prepared for  places of 10,000 population or more outside UA's unless done under contract,  nor for UA's in not-yet-defined SMSA's.   Some blocks defined for 1970 will have new boundaries in 1980, primarily  those on the edges of UA's and other areas of new development where the  street patterns have changed.  To help the user notice a change wherever a  block has been redefined by splitting or other adjustment, the 1970 block  number will generally not be reused.  Where blocks were recognized for the  1970 census, their boundaries and numbers generally will be the same in  1980, except for a few areas where blocks were renumbered by local  GBF/DIME-File coordinating agencies in order to define more desirable block  groups.   BLOCK GROUP (BG).  A combination of numbered census blocks that is a  subdivision of a census tract or block numbering area (BNA) and is defined  in all areas for which block statistics are prepared.  (In areas where  blocks are not numbered, ED's are used instead of BG's.)   BG's are not outlined on census maps, but are defined as that set of  numbered blocks sharing the same first digit within a census tract or BNA.  For example, Block Group ""3"" within a particular census tract would include  any blocks numbered between 301 and 399.  In most cases, the numbering would  generally involve substantially fewer than 50 blocks, since gaps are  occasionally left in the numbering; e.g., Block 312 might be followed by  Block 316.   BG's are defined within census tract or BNA.  They may cross, and be split  by, the boundaries of minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census county  divisions (CCD's), places, congressional districts, urbanized areas, and  Indian reservations.  When this occurs, statistical summaries (data records)  are provided for each component or part.  To avoid mistaking a component  summary for a complete BG summary, users should carefully study census maps  to note any BG's split by place, MCD or CCD, urbanized area, and Indian  reservation boundaries.  Congressional district (CD) boundaries are not  shown on census maps, so the maps will not be of use in detecting BG's split  by CD boundaries.   BG summaries observe boundaries of some areas (specifically, CCD's and, in  10 States, MCD's) which are ignored in summarizing data for the block  statistics presentations in reports and on tape.  As a result, it will  occasionally be necessary to add BG components together to match the sum of  blocks in the same hundreds series.   Statistics will be prepared for almost 200,000 BG's.  BG data, together with  data for ED's, appear on STF's 1A and 3A, and in any corresponding  microfiche.  There are no printed data for BG's.   Historical comparability:  In areas where BG's were tabulated in 1970, many  1980 BG's will be the same as their 1970 counterparts, with exceptions  occurring primarily in areas where tract boundaries have changed or where  substantial development has taken place.  Also, BG parts, created when BG's  are split by the boundaries of higher level areas, will change if such  boundaries have changed.   Many areas with BG's in 1980 had data reported by ED's in 1970, a change  occasioned in part by the expansion of the block statistics program, and in  part because ED's were used for tabulation purposes in 1970 instead of BG's  in some block numbered areas.  Where BG's have replaced ED's, there will be  little comparability between 1970 ED's and 1980 BG's.   BLOCK NUMBERING AREA (BNA).  An area defined for the purpose of grouping and  numbering blocks in block-numbered areas where census tracts have not been  defined--typically, in non-SMSA places of 10,000 or more population and in  contract block areas.  BNA's do not cross county boundaries.  They are  identified by census tract-type numbers ranging from 9901.00 to 9989.99  which are unique within a county.  While BNA numbers are similar to census  tract numbers, BNA's are not census tracts and are not included in STF's 2  or 4.   BNA's may be split by the boundaries of places, MCD's, and CCD's.  Statistical summaries appear in STF 1B and PHC80-1 Block Statistics  microfiche series for the component parts of BNA's created when BNA's are  split by the boundaries of places and, in 20 States, MCD's.  (See figure 4,  column 3.)  Such component summaries appear in STF 1A and 3A when BNA's are  split by the boundaries of CCD's in 20 States (see figure 4, column 1) and  MCD's in 10 other States and Puerto Rico.   Historical comparability:  While BNA's were also used in previous censuses,  any historical comparability is generally coincidental.   BOROUGH (IN ALASKA).  See COUNTY.    C-G   CENSUS AREA (IN ALASKA).  See COUNTY.   CENSUS COUNTY DIVISION (CCD).  A statistical subdivision of a county,  roughly comparable to a minor civil division (MCD).  CCD's are defined in 20  States (see figure 4, column 1) which do not have MCD's suitable for  reporting census statistics (i.e., the MCD's have either lost their original  significance, are very small in population, have frequent boundary changes,  and/or have indefinite boundaries).  CCD's are established cooperatively by  the Census Bureau and both State and local government authorities.  They are  generally defined by boundary features that seldom change and can be easily  located, such as roads, rivers, and powerlines.   The Census Bureau has assigned each CCD, alphabetically sequenced within  county, an incremental unique 3-digit numeric code.  The National Bureau of  Standards has assigned each CCD, alphabetically sequenced within State, an  incremental unique 5-digit numeric FIPS ""place"" code.   CCD boundaries are represented on detailed census maps, such as place maps  and county maps.  In addition, CCD outlines appear at a small scale on maps  published in several 1980 reports.  Statistics for about 5,500 CCD's appear  in STF's 1A, 2B, 3A, and 4B, and in PC80-1-A and -B and HC80-1-A reports.   Historical comparability:  In 1980, CCD's are defined in one fewer State  than in 1970--North Dakota returned to the use of its MCD's (townships).  However, 1980 data for North Dakota's 1970 CCD's are available in STF 1E.  In the past, cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants generally were defined  as separate CCD's.  When these cities annexed territory, CCD boundaries also  had to be adjusted.  For 1980, many of these CCD boundaries were revised to  conform with census tract boundaries where tracts exist, and permanent  physical features elsewhere, in an attempt to minimize future CCD boundary  adjustments.  Many CCD's which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are  noted in footnotes to table 4 of the PC80-1-A reports for States with CCD's.   CENSUS SUBAREA.  A statistical subdivision of a ""census area"" or borough  (county equivalent) in Alaska.  Census subareas take the place of minor  civil divisions (MCD's or census county divisions (CCD's).   Historical comparability:  In 1970, Alaska county equivalents were called  ""divisions,"" and some were subdivided further.  Some of the census subareas  used in the 1980 census approximate the 1970 divisions or their subdivisions.   CENSUS TRACT.  A small statistical subdivision of a county.  Tracts  generally have stable boundaries.  When tracts are established, they are  designed to be relatively homogeneous areas with respect to population  characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  Tracts generally  have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents.  All standard metropolitan  statistical areas (SMSA's) recognized for the 1980 census have census  tracts.  Most of these SMSA's are completely tracted, but seven SMSA's newly  created as a result of the 1980 census include outlying counties which are  not tracted.  In addition, an estimated 3,000 census tracts have been  established in 221 counties outside SMSA's.  Five States and the District of  Columbia are entirely tracted:  Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey,  and Rhode Island.  In all, there are over 43,300 census tracts for the 1980  census (excluding 465 in Puerto Rico).   Census tract boundaries are established cooperatively by local Census  Statistical Areas Committees and the Census Bureau in accordance with  guidelines that impose limitations on population size and specify the need  for visible boundaries.  Geographic shape and area size of tracts are of  relatively minor importance.  Tract boundaries are established with the  intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical  comparisons can be made from census to census.  Census tracts observe county  lines and cover all of the territory within each tracted county.  Within a  county, tract boundaries may be split by other geographic boundaries.   Census tracts are identified by a 4-digit basic code and may have a 2-digit  suffix, e.g., 6059.02.  On tape, the decimal is implied.  Many census tracts  do not have a suffix.  In such cases, tapes give the 4-digit code followed  by two blanks.  Leading zeros in a tract number (e.g., 0025.02) do not  appear on the maps (e.g., 25.02.).   Tract numbers are always unique within a county, and, except for the New  York SMSA, are also unique within an SMSA.  All valid census tract numbers  are in the range 0001 to 9899.99; a number between 9901 and 9989.99 denotes  a block numbering area (BNA).   Census tract boundaries are shown on all detailed census maps, such as place  maps and county maps.  In addition, census tract outline maps are being  created for each SMSA and each tracted county outside SMSA's.  Tract outline  maps show only those streets and physical features which serve as census  tract boundaries.  In addition, the boundaries of places, MCD's, CCD's,  counties, and States appear on tract outline maps.   Census tract data are presented in STF's 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A, and in  PHC80-2 Census Tracts reports.  In STF's 1A and 3A, tract data are presented  in hierarchial sequence within place within MCD or CCD.  In a case where a  tract is split by place, MCD, or CCD boundaries, the tape files will have  summaries for each of its parts.  To get data for the whole tract, it will  be necessary to add up the components.  In STF 1B the situation is similar  except that MCD boundaries are observed in only 20 States and Puerto Rico.  (See figure 4, column 3.)  MCD boundaries in the other 10 States with MCD's  and CCD boundaries in the remaining 20 States are ignored.  In the major  summaries for census tracts--those in STF's 2A and 4A and in PHC80-2 Census  Tracts reports--tract summaries observe the boundaries of places of 10,000  or more population.  Separate summaries provide totals for split tracts.   Historical comparability:  Census tracts are defined with an overall goal of  census-to-census comparability.  Some 1970 tracts have been subdivided due  to increased population, but the new tracts can be recombined by the user  for comparison with 1970 tracts.  This affects about 8 percent of all 1970  tracts.  Other changes have included combinations of two or more small 1970  tracts (less than 1 percent of all 1970 tracts) and adjustments to tract  boundaries where old boundary features have disappeared or better boundaries  (e.g., freeways) have come into being.  In a few areas, local Census  Statistical Areas Committees undertook extensive redefinition of census  tracts.   Census Tracts reports, PHC80-2, include 1970-1980 tract comparability tables  showing 1980 tracts which were split, combined, or had boundary realignments  affecting areas with 100 or more people along with the 1970 tracts or parts  of tracts to which they correspond.  The list is presented both ways:  1970  tracts in terms of 1970 counterparts, and 1980 in terms of 1970  counterparts.  Since the affected parts of individual tracts (e.g.,  individual blocks) are not specified, the comparability list essentially  serves to draw attention to areas which should be studied further on 1980  and 1970 maps, preferably those which show detail by block.   Both the number of tracted counties and the number of census tracts  increased by over 20 percent between 1970 and 1980.  The reporting of data  for split tracts has also increased.  Whereas 1970 Census Tracts reports  gave data for tract parts created when tracts were split by the boundaries  of only those places with 25,000 or more population, 1980 reports observe  boundaries of places as small as 10,000.  1980 STF's 2 and 4 present data  for the components of split tracts, as well as for whole tracts, whereas  their 1970 counterparts did not provide separate summaries for the  components of split tracts.   CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD).  An area of very high land valuation  characterized by a high concentration of retail businesses, service  businesses, offices, theaters, and hotels, and by a high traffic flow.  A  CBD follows census tract boundaries, i.e., it consists of one or more whole  census tracts.  CBD's are identified only in central cities of SMSA's and  other cities with a population of 50,000 or more, and are designated by  local Census Statistical Areas Committees in consultation with the Census  Bureau.  However, some eligible cities have chosen not to participate in the  CBD delineation program.  CBD's do not extend beyond the boundaries of the  city.   The CBD's now recognized were delineated for the 1977 Economic Censuses.  The Bureau does not plan to prepare 1980 statistics for CBD's, but users may  derive data by aggregating data for component census tracts or smaller  areas.  Records for such areas are indicated on most machine-readable files.   Historical comparability:  At the time of the 1970 census, CBD's were  defined only in cities of 100,000 or more persons.   CENTROID, POPULATION.  See POPULATION CENTROID.   CENTRAL CITY.  See STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA; URBANIZED AREA.   CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.  One of the 435 State or sub-State areas from which  persons are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  Two sets of  congressional districts are recognized in 1980 census products.  Districts  of the 96th Congress (1979-1980) which were also in effect for the 97th  Congress (1981-1982) are summarized on STF 1A and STF 3A.  Districts of the  98th Congress (1983-1984) reflecting redistricting based on the 1980 census,  are summarized on STF 1D and STF 3D and in series PHC80-4, Congressional  Districts of the 98th Congress.   The PHC80-4 reports, issued by State, include a map of the State showing  congressional district boundaries in relation to county outlines.  More  detailed maps follow showing selected congressional district boundaries in  cases where the State map cannot delineate the congressional districts with  sufficient clarity.  These maps have been republished in the Congressional  District Atlas for the 98th Congress.  Congressional district boundaries are  not shown on detailed 1980 census maps.   Historical comparability:  Districts of the 96th Congress were the same as  districts for the 93rd Congress for all but 4 States:  New York, California,  and Texas, which were redistricted for the 94th Congress; and Tennessee, in  which one boundary change took effect for the 95th Congress.  1970 data for  these congressional districts were published in Congressional District Data  (CDD) report series for the 93rd and 94th Congresses, but not including the  later change for Tennessee.  The Congressional District Data Book  republished CDD reports for the 93rd Congress.   COUNTY.  The primary political and administrative subdivision of a State.  In Louisiana, such divisions are called parishes.  In Alaska, 23 boroughs  and ""census areas"" are treated as county equivalents for census purposes.  Several cities (Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, Missouri; Carson City,  Nevada; and 41 Virginia cities) are independent of any county organization,  and thereby constitute primary divisions of their States and are treated the  same as counties in census tabulations.   County boundaries are shown on most census maps.  A 3-digit Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) county code identifies each county  uniquely within State.  Counties are numbered in alphabetic sequence, with  independent cities numbered separately at the end of the list.   There are 3,215 counties and county equivalents (including 78 in Puerto  Rico) recognized for the 1980 census.  Tabulations for all counties appear  in STF's 1 through 4, and in PC80-1-A, -B, and -C, HC80-1-A and -B and  PHC80-3 reports.  Tabulations for counties of 50,000 or more inhabitants  appear in STF 5.   Historical comparability:  A number of changes have occurred to county  boundaries since 1970.  A new set of county equivalents (boroughs and census  areas) has been defined for Alaska, and in some cases these county  equivalents differ considerably from the census divisions recognized for  1970.  In addition, there are minor changes in counties for South Dakota and  Hawaii.  In Virginia, county boundaries have changed as a result of the  creation of new independent cities or annexations by independent cities.  Most other changes represent minor adjustments of the boundaries between  counties.  Those counties which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are  noted in footnotes at the end of table 4 of the PC80-1-A report for each  State.   COUNTY EQUIVALENT.  See COUNTY.   DIVISION (CENSUS GEOGRAPHIC).  A census geographic division is one of the  nine groups of States which are subdivisions of the four census geographic  regions of the United States.  Census geographic divisions are identified by  a 1-digit code which is also the first digit of the 2-digit census  geographic code for each State in the division.   Historical comparability:  Census divisions have remained unchanged since  the 1910 census, except for the expansion of the Pacific Division to include  Alaska and Hawaii.   ECONOMIC SUBREGION (ESR).  A grouping of State Economic Areas (SEA's) which  brings together those SEA's which are most closely related in terms of their  economic and social characteristics.  The areas were first defined following  the 1950 census and updated after the 1960 census.  To achieve such  homogeneity, State boundaries are frequently crossed.  The 510 SEA's are  grouped into 121 ESR's.  A 3-digit numeric code is assigned to each ESR.  No  data summaries will be prepared for ESR's, although the ESR code appears on  the geographic records of the summary tape files.   Historical comparability:  ESR boundaries have remained the same since 1960.   See also:  STATE ECONOMIC AREA (SEA).   ENUMERATION DISTRICT (ED).  An area used in the 1980 census for data  collection activities and as a tabulation area where blocks are not  present.  ED's do not cross the boundaries of legal or statistical areas;  for example, census tracts, MCD's/CCD's, places, counties, congressional  districts, and States.  Because of these constraints, they vary widely in  population size, although they do not generally exceed a population of 1,600  in areas where the census was taken by mail, or a population of 1,000 in  areas where the census was taken by conventional enumerator canvassing.  The  population limits are designed so that an ED generally represents a  reasonable workload for one enumerator.  About 1,000 jurisdictions in 47  States participated in a program for local definition of ED's.  In areas  without blocks, ED's are the smallest unit of census geography for which  statistics are prepared.   ED boundaries are shown on MMS/VMS, place, and county maps in areas where  there are no block numbers.  ED's are identified by a 4-digit number (except  that leading zeros, when they occur in ED numbers, do not appear on the  maps).  An ED number may be followed by a one-letter alphabetic suffix.  The  suffix is used to identify subdivisions of ED's made during data collection  and processing activities where the original ED proved to be too populous  for an efficient work unit, or to accommodate a revision to a place or other  boundary made after January 1, 1978 in mailout/mailback areas or January 1,  1979 in conventional census areas.  An ED number may also have a one-letter  prefix indicating that the ED is of a special type (e.g., an American Indian  reservation), but the prefix is not necessary for unique identification of  the ED.  ED numbers do not repeat within a county.  Any ED may be uniquely  identified by accompanying its ED code with the 2-digit State code and  3-digit county code.   Statistics will be prepared for about 100,000 ED's.  ED data, together with  data for BG's, appear on STF's 1A and 3A and corresponding microfiche.  In  addition, ED data appear on STF 1B to complement the summaries for blocks.  There are no printed data for ED's.   Historical comparability:  Many areas which were covered by ED's in 1970 are  summarized in terms of blocks and BG's for 1980.  In some cases, it may be  possible to add up blocks to approximate the 1970 ED's, based on detailed  comparison of 1980 and 1970 maps.   In areas covered by ED's for 1980, enumeration considerations dictated ED  size and design, and historical comparability does not normally enter into  consideration.   ESKIMO POPULATION.  See RACE.   FAMILY.  Two or more persons, including the householder, who are related by  birth, marriage, or adoption and who live together as one household; all  such persons are considered as members of one family.  (Persons not in  families and not inmates of institutions are classified as unrelated  individuals.)  Families are defined using responses to the complete-count  household relationship question.   If the son/daughter of the person or couple who maintain the household and  the son's or daughter's spouse and/or children are members of the household,  they are treated as part of the householder's family.  A roomer/boarder and  his/her spouse who are not related to the person or persons who maintain the  household, or a resident employee and his/her spouse living in, are not  counted as a family, but as individuals unrelated to the householder.  Thus,  a household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations.   A person maintaining a household alone, or two or more unrelated persons are  regarded as a household but not as a family.  Thus, some households do not  contain a family.   (In certain Census Bureau surveys (e.g., CPS) before 1980, families as  defined here are referred to as ""primary families.""  The term ""secondary  family"" refers to a resident family unrelated to the householder, such as a  roomer and his/her spouse.  Tabulations of families from such surveys  include secondary families.)   Historical comparability:  A similar definition for family was used in  1970.  In 1960, secondary families were also identified.  In 1960, secondary  families were also identified.   GROUP QUARTERS, PERSONS IN.  Persons in living arrangements, such as nursing  homes or rooming houses, which are not households.  Group quarters status  was determined on a complete-count basis.   Two general categories of persons in group quarters are recognized.       Inmate of institution.  A person under care or custody at the time of      enumeration.  Inmates are persons in such facilities as homes, schools,      hospitals, or wards for the physically or mentally handicapped; persons      in hospitals or wards for mental, tubercular, or chronic diseases;      persons in homes for unmarried mothers; persons in nursing,      convalescent, and rest homes for the aged and dependent; persons in      orphanages; and persons in correctional institutions.  These persons are      enumerated as residents of an institution--regardless of their length of      stay in the particular place and regardless of the number of people in      the places.  Some tabulations include data by major types of      institutions (home for the aged, mental hospital, correctional      institution, and other institutions).       Other persons in group quarters.  Persons living in group quarters who      are not inmates of institutions.  Rooming and boarding houses, communes,      farm and nonfarm workers' dormitories, convents or monasteries, and      other living quarters are classified as ""other"" group quarters if there      are 9 or more persons unrelated to the person listed in column 1 of the      census questionnaire; or if 10 or more unrelated persons share the      unit.  Persons residing in certain other types of living arrangements      are classified as living in ""other"" group quarters regardless of the      number or relationship of people in the unit.  These include persons      residing in military attacks, on ships, in college dormitories, or in      sorority and fraternity houses; patients in general or maternity wards      of hospitals who have no usual residence elsewhere; staff members in      institutional quarters; and persons enumerated in missions, flophouses,      Salvation Army shelters, railroad stations, etc.    H-O   Historical comparability:  In 1970, 6 or more unrelated persons living  together were classified as group quarters; for 1980 that requirement was  raised to 10 or more unrelated persons.   See also:  HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.   HISTORIC AREAS OF OKLAHOMA (EXCLUDING URBANIZED AREAS).  The historic areas  of Oklahoma consist of the former reservations that had legally established  boundaries during the period 1900-1907.  These reservations were dissolved  during the 2- to 3-year period preceding the statehood of Oklahoma in 1907.  The former reservation boundaries are used for planning purposes by tribes  and the Federal government.  In the census, the entire area encompassing the  former reservations was identified (except for parts inside urbanized areas  as approximated in preparation for the 1980 census); individual former  reservations were not identified separately.   The historic areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas) were assigned a  unique 3-digit code by the Bureau which appears in the reservation code  field.  Enumeration districts (ED's), block groups (BG's), and/or portions  of BG's that comprise the historic areas (excluding urbanized areas) are  designated with an ""A"" in the ED prefix ield in tape files for Oklahoma.   Historical comparability:  Historic areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized  areas) were not identified in previous censuses.   HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.  The number of persons living in the housing unit.  All occupants are counted--not just those related to the householder, but  also any lodgers, roomers, boarders, partners, wards, foster children, and  resident employees who share the living quarters.   Figures for ""persons in households"" match those for ""persons in units"" in  tabulations based on complete-count data.  In sample tabulations, they may  differ because of the weighting process.  The phrase ""persons in household""  is used for population tabulations, ""persons in unit"" for housing items.  ""One-person households"" and ""persons living alone"" are synonymous.   See also:  FAMILY.   HOUSING UNIT.  A house, apartment, mobile home or trailer, group of rooms,  or single room occupied as a separate living quarter or, if vacant, intended  for occupancy as a separate living quarter.  Separate living quarters are  those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons  in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the  building or through a common hall.   The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more  families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons  who share living arrangements (except as described in the definition of  Group Quarters, Persons In).  For vacant units, the criteria of separateness  and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.  If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the  previous occupants.  Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in  the housing inventory, except that recreational vehicles, caves, boats,  tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as  someone's usual place of residence.  Vacant mobile homes are included  provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand.  Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage  yards are excluded from the housing inventory.  Housing unit status was  determined on a complete-count basis.   Historical comparability:  The first Census of Housing in 1940 established  the ""dwelling unit"" concept.  Although the term became ""housing unit"" and  the definition has been modified slightly in each succeeding census, the  1980 definition is essentially comparable to previous censuses.  In 1970,  the definition of a housing unit stipulated that the occupants live and eat  separately and have either direct access or complete kitchen facilities.  For 1980, direct access is required; the alternative of complete kitchen  facilities has been dropped.  In 1970, vacant mobile homes were not  counted.  In 1980, vacant mobile homes as included in the housing inventory  if they intended for occupancy where they stand.  Also in 1970, units with  six or more unrelated persons living together were classified as group  quarters; for 1980 that requirement was raised to ten or more unrelated  persons.   See also:  GROUP QUARTERS, PERSONS IN; OCCUPANCY STATUS; TENURE.   LAND AREA.  Land area measurements are calculated to the nearest hundredth  of a square mile for States, counties, county subdivisions with a 1980  census population of 2,500 or more (for the States of Connecticut, Maine,  Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,  Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin only), county subdivisions with a 1980  census population of less than 2,500 that are within an SMSA (for the States  of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and  Vermont only), and places with a 1980 census population of 2,500 or more.   In contrast to population centroids on MARF 2, only whole-place land area  totals are repeated on all ""part"" records for a place split by higher-level  geography.  The land area field is blank for:  (1) the ""balances"" of county  subdivisions and; (2) on the county subdivision record immediately preceding  the place record for a place of 2,500 or more population that also is  treated as a county subdivision.  The decimal point is shown in the data for  this field.  Figures are right-justified without leading zeros.  The value  for land area in square kilometers can be obtained by multiplying the square  miles figure by 2.59.   MINOR CIVIL DIVISION (MCD).  A primary political and administrative  subdivision of a county.  MCD's are most frequently known as townships, but  in some States they include towns, magisterial districts, and similar  areas.  A few counties have some territory not organized into MCD's; such  ""unorganized territory"" is treated as one or more MCD's for census purposes.   MCD's are used for census purposes in 29 States (see figure 4, column 2).  In 20 of the remaining States, CCD's are used in lieu of MCD's and in  Alaska, census subareas are used.  In the District of Columbia, quandrants  are used.  In Puerto Rico, ciudades, pueblos, and barrios are used.   The Census Bureau has assigned each MCD, alphabetically sequenced within  county, an incremental unique 3-digit numeric code.  In addition, MCD's in  11 States (those noted in column 4 of figure 4) have a 4-digit ""MCD sequence  number"" which allows MCD's to be sorted into alphabetical sequence within a  State.   MCD boundaries are represented on all detailed census maps.  In addition,  MCD outlines appear on small-scale maps published in PC80-1-A and -B and  HC80-1-A reports and in conjunction with the PHC80-2 series.  There are more  than 26,000 MCD's recognized for the 1980 census.   Statistics for all MCD's appear in STF's 1A, 2B, 3A, and 4B, and in PC80-1-A  and -B and HC80-1-A reports.  In 20 States (specified in column 3 of figure  4), many MCD's serve as functioning general-purpose governments, and these  active MCD's are included in PHC80-3 Summary Characteristics for  Governmental Units and Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.  All MCD's  in block-numbered areas of these States are included in the PHC80-1.  Block   Statistics microfiche series and STF 1B.  Finally, in 11 States (all 9  States in the Northeast region, plus Michigan and Wisconsin), MCD data are  published in a manner parallel to that of places of the same population size  in tables of PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  (See figure 4, column 4.)   Historical comparability:  CCD's were used in North Dakota in 1970, but for  1980 that State returned to the use of its townships.  A number of MCD's in  other States have changed boundaries.  Changes have resulted from municipal  annexations, mergers or dissolutions of MCD's, and other causes.  There are  seven States where MCD boundaries have changed substantially:  Arkansas,  Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Virginia, and West Virginia.  MCD's which have changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are noted in  footnotes to table 4 of PC80-1-A reports for States with MCD's.   MUNICIPIO.  See PUERTO RICO and OUTLYING AREAS.   OCCUPANCY STATUS.  The classification of all housing units as either  occupied or vacant.  The item was determined on a complete-count basis.       Occupied.  A housing unit occupied as the usual place of residence of a      person or group of persons living in it at the time of enumeration, or      by occupants only temporarily absent such as on vacation.  A household      consists of all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual      place of residence.  If all the persons staying in the unit at the time      of enumeration have their usual place of residence elsewhere, the unit      is classified as vacant.  Complete count figures on households and      occupied housing units should match--although sample estimates of      households and occupied units may differ because of weighting.       Vacant.  A housing unit with no one living in it at the time of      enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent.  If, at      the time of enumeration, the unit is temporarily occupied solely by      persons who have a usual residence elsewhere, it is classified as vacant.   Historical comparability:  Similar data have been collected since 1940.   OTHER RACES.  See RACE.   OWNER-OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS.  See TENURE.    P-R   PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION.  See RACE.   PARISH (IN LOUISIANA).  See COUNTY.   PER CAPITA INCOME.  Per capita income is the mean or average income computed  by aggregating the total income for every man, woman, and child in a  particular population group or geographic area.  It is derived by dividing  the total income by the total population.   Care should be exercised in using and interpreting per capita (mean or  average) values for small geographic areas or population groups.  Since per  capita income amounts are strongly influenced by extreme values in the  distribution, they are especially susceptible to the effects of sampling  variability, misreporting, and processing errors.   PERSONS IN HOUSEHOLD.  See HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.   PLACE.  A concentration of population which may or may not have legally  prescribed limits, powers, or functions.  Most of the places identified in  the 1980 census are incorporated as cities, towns, villages, or boroughs.  In addition, census designated places (called ""unincorporated places"" in  earlier censuses) are delineated for 1980 census tabulations.  There are  about 23,000 places recorded in the 1980 census.  Places do not cross State  boundaries.       Incorporated place.  A political unit incorporated as a city, borough      (excluding Alaska and New York), village, or town (excluding the New      England States, New York, and Wisconsin).  In most States, incorporated      places are subdivisions of the MCD or CCD in which they are located; for      example, a village located within and legally part of a township.  In      some States, incorporated places are independent of surrounding      townships or towns and therefore are also treated as MCD's.  In a few      States, the pattern is mixed.  Almost 4,000 incorporated places cross      MCD/CCD and/or county boundaries.       There are about 20,000 incorporated places recognized in the 1980 census.       Census designated place (CDP).  A densely settled population center      without legally defined corporate limits or corporate powers or      functions.  Each CDP has a definite residential nucleus with a dense,      city-type street pattern, and ideally should have an overall population      density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile.  In addition, a CDP      is a community that can be identified locally by place name.  Boundaries      of CDP's are drawn by the Census Bureau, in cooperation with State and      local agencies, to include, insofar as possible, all the closely settled      area.  In the 1980 census, statistics are tabulated for each CDP with      5,000 inhabitants or more if located in an urbanized area (UA) with a      central city of 50,000 or more and for each CDP of 1,000 inhabitants or      more if in a UA with no central city of 50,000 or more.  Some      CDP's--notably in the Northeast--coincide with MCD's.  In STF's, these      are treated as both places and MCD's, but in printed reports they are      shown only in MCD tables to avoid duplication.  Outside of UA's,      statistics are tabulated in the 48 States and Puerto Rico for CDP's of      1,000 or more, in Hawaii for CDP's of 300 or more, and in Alaska for      CDP's of 25 or more.       There are approximately 3,400 CDP's recognized in the 1980 census.   Incorporated place and CDP boundaries are shown on all detailed census  maps.  For tracted areas, boundaries of all places are shown on census tract  outline maps.  County subdivision maps, at still smaller scale, also show  boundaries for places.   A 4-digit numeric code is assigned by the Census Bureau to each place in  alphabetic sequence within State.  ""Place description"" codes will also  generally accompany place records.  These codes indicate whether or not a  place is incorporated, as well as represent certain other information about  the place.  A 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code  is also assigned to each county subdivision (MCD/CCD) and place in the 1980  census (as well as to a variety of non-census areas, such as airports and  parks).   Data are summarized for all places in STF's 1A and 3A and PC80-1-A reports.  For places with 1,000 or more inhabitants, data are summarized in STF 2B,  and PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  For places with 2,500 or more, data are  summarized in STF 4B, PC80-1-C, and HC80-1-B reports.  In PHC80-3 reports,  data are given for all incorporated places.  In the PHC80-2 Census Tracts  reports and STF's 2A and 4A, summaries are presented only for places with  10,000 or more inhabitants located in tracted areas.  Very detailed data are  presented for all places which are central cities of SMSA's in PC80-1-D  reports, and places with 50,000 or more inhabitants in HC80-2 reports.  STF  5 also provides detailed data for places of 50,000 or more.   The files and reports which sequence geographic units in hierarchial fashion  must account for the fact that places may cross the boundaries of counties,  MCD's, and CCD's.  Such reports and tapes, therefore, provide summaries for  the various parts of places created when places are split by the boundaries  of higher-level areas recognized in the hierarchy.  Specifically, place  parts within county and MCD or CCD are presented in STF's 1A and 3A, and  PC80-1-A.  Place parts within county and MCD are presented for 20 specified  States and Puerto Rico in STF 1B and PHC80-1 Block Statistics microfiche  reports, but the PHC80-1 reports include only places which have data  collected for blocks.  In the remaining 30 States, STF 1B and PHC80-1  reports subdivide places when split by county boundaries, but do not observe  MCD or CCD boundaries.   Historical comparability:  Sixty-eight percent of all incorporated places of  2,500 or more made changes in their boundaries between 1970 and January 1,  1980, which is the reference date for boundaries in the 1980 census.  In the  1970 census, ED boundaries were drawn so as to allow a user to aggregate  1970 data for each city of 2,000 or more inhabitants according to 1960  boundaries.  There will not be a corresponding capability in the 1980 census.   In the 1970 and earlier censuses, CDP's were referred to as ""unincorporated  places.""  The name was changed to make it more explicit that such places are  defined for census purposes, and to avoid confusion in States where many  ""unincorporated places"" are parts of incorporated towns or townships.  Many   CDP's have been redefined since 1970.  Incorporated places which were newly  incorporated or which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are listed in  footnotes to table 4 of PC80-1-A reports.   POPULATION CENTROID.  MARF 2 provides geographic coordinates, expressed in  decimal degrees of latitude and longitude to four decimal places (decimal is  not shown), for the estimated population centroid of each tabulated  enumeration district (ED) and block group (BG).  The figures are  right-justified without leading zeros; directions (north latitude and west  longitude) are not shown.  Where a BG is split by higher-level geography  that appears on published maps--i.e., county subdivision, place, urbanized  area, American Indian reservation and Alaska Native village--coordinate  values are not provided for the entire BG, but only for each split piece.  Separate coordinates are not provided for the portions of a BG split by  congressional district (96th Congress) or American Indian reservation  subreservation area; that is, such BG records are all assigned the same set  of coordinates.   Population centroid coordinates are calculated either by an arithmetic  computer algorithm applied to block boundaries as recorded in digitized  GBF/DIME-Files or, elsewhere, digitized directly from a population centroid  that has been approximated manually.  A centroid must be located within its  ED/BG except where determined via the computer algorithm.  In cases where  there are irreconcilable discrepancies between census maps and census data  files, the coordinates are those of the area to which the population should  have been allocated or, if unpopulated, those of the next higher level of  geography associated with the nonmapped MARF record.   Coordinate values are provided for higher geographic levels (census tracts,  places, county subdivisions, counties, and States) based on weighted  averages of individual component ED and/or BG values.  In cases where all  the components of a higher-level geographic area had a population of zero,  an implied population of one was used in the averaging formula.  As with  BG's, MARF 2 does not provide coordinate values for entire census tracts or  places that are split by higher-level geography, but only for each split  part.  For a place that also serves as a county subdivision, the centroid  values duplicate on the county subdivision record immediately preceding the  place record.  Centroid coordinates are provided for the remainder of county  subdivisions; in some instances, these values will be located within a place  rather than in the ""remainder"" area.   PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.  In addition to the United States, the  decennial census covers Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust  Territory of the Pacific Islands (including the Northern Mariana Islands  which were legally part of the Trust Territory in 1980), the Virgin Islands  of the United States, and certain other small islands over which the United  States exercises sovereignty or jurisdiction.  Questionnaire design and the  questions asked were developed for Puerto Rico and each outlying area to  accommodate local conditions.  In the case of some small or  military-occupied islands, enumerations were not conducted; only population  counts obtained from U.S. Government records are published.   The geographic subareas for which statistics are reported vary.  Some of  those noted below are defined in this glossary; others will be defined in  1980 census reports for the areas.       American Samoa:  villages, district subdivisions, districts, and islands.       Guam:  census designated places and election districts.       Puerto Rico:  blocks; ED's and BG's; census tracts and block numbering      areas; zonas urbanas and aldeas; subbarrios; barrios, ciudades, and      pueblos; municipios; and SMSA's and SCSA's.       Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (including the Northern Mariana      Islands):  census designated places, municipal districts, municipalities      and islands, and administrative districts.       Virgin Islands:  places, census subdistricts, and islands.       Other islands:  no subdivisions.   Data for Puerto Rico and its subdivisions will appear in reports and tapes  in generally the same pattern as for States and their subdivisions.  Data  for outlying areas will appear in 1980 Census of Population, Volume 1, and  1980 Census of Housing, Volume 1, reports, and on STF's 1 and 3.   Historical comparability:  The Canal Zone was not included in the 1980  census because it was no longer under U.S. jurisdiction.   Race, all persons were asked to identify themselves according to the  following race categories on the 1980 questionnaire:  White, Black or Negro,  American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Asian  Indian, Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, and other.  The ""other""  category includes Malayan, Polynesian, Thai, and other groups not included  in the specific categories listed on the questionnaire.  This item was asked  on a complete-count basis.   The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects  self-identification by respondents; it does not denote any clear-cut  scientific definition of biological stock.  Since the 1980 census obtained  information on race through self-identification, the data represent  self-classification by people according to the race with which they identify  themselves.  For persons with parents of different races who could not  provide a single response to the race question, the race of the person's  mother was used; however, if a single response could not be provided for the  person's mother, the first race reported by the person was used.   Edit and review operations were performed during the complete-count  tabulations; write-in responses were reviewed in an attempt to classify  entries in specific categories, where appropriate.  For instance, if the   ""Other"" circle was marked with a write-in entry ""Caucasian,"" then the  response recoded as White.  (Additional examples are noted below.)  However,  all such cases were not specified in the complete-count processing.  During  the processing of sample questionnaires, a more thorough review and  additional editing was done to resolve inconsistent or incomplete  responses.  Also, during the processing of sample questionnaires, write-in  entries for the ""Other"" category were assigned specific codes, which were  included on the person's basic record in the census detailed tape files.   Asian and Pacific Islander write-in entries, such as Indo-Chinese,  Cambodian, or Polynesian, included in the ""Other"" category during  100-percent processing, are collectively tabulated and shown as ""Other Asian  and Pacific Islander"" in the census sample tabulations; this group, ""Other  Asian and Pacific Islander,"" will be included in the broader Asian and  Pacific Islander category in all sample tabulations by race.  This shift of  ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander"" entries out of the ""Other races"" category  in sample tabulations and the recoding of write-in entries in the ""Other""  category to specific categories where appropriate will affect the  comparability between complete-count and sample data for some groups in  certain geographic areas.       White.  Persons who indicated their race as White, as well as persons      who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race categories      listed on the questionnaire but entered a response such as Canadian,      German, Italian, Lebanese, or Polish.  (Persons who did not classify      themselves in one of the specific race categories but wrote in entries      such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, or Dominican were included in the      ""Other races"" category; in the 1970 census most of these persons were      included in the ""White"" category.)       Black.  Persons who indicated their race as Black or Negro, as well as      persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race      categories, but reported entries such as Black Puerto Rican, Hatian,      Jamaican, Nigerian, or West Indian.       American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut:            American Indian.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Indian           (American)"" or who did not indicate a specific race category but           reported the name of an Indian tribe.            Eskimo.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Eskimo.""            Aleut.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Aleut.""       Asian and Pacific Islander:  In complete-count tabulations, includes all      of the groups listed below except ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander.""      In sample tabulations, it includes all of the groups listed below.            Japanese.  Persons who indicated their race as Japanese, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as Nipponese or Japanese           American.            Chinese.  Persons who indicated their race as Chinese, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but reported entries such as Cantonese, Formosan,           Taiwanese, or Tibetan.            Filipino.  Persons who indicated their race as Filipino, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as Filipino American or           Philippine.            Korean.  Persons who indicated their race as Korean, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but reported a response such as Korean American.            Asian Indian.Persons who indicated their race as Asian Indian, as           well as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the           specific race categories, but reported entries such as Bengali,           Bharati, Dravidian, East Indian, Goanese, Hindu Indic, Kashmiri, or           South Asian.            Vietnamese.  Persons who indicated their race as Vietnamese, as           well as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the           specific race categories, but reported a response such as Vietnam.            Hawaiian.  Persons who indicated their race as Hawaiian.  In the           State of Hawaii, all persons who reported ""Part-Hawaiian"" were           included in this category.            Guamanian.  Persons who indicated their race as Guamanian, as well           as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific           race categories, but reported an entry such as Chamorro or Guam.            Samoan.  Persons who indicated their race as Samoan, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as American Samoan or           Western Samoan.            Other Asian and Pacific Islander.  In sample tabulations only,           persons who reported Cambodian, Hmong, Indo-Chinese, Laotian,           Pakistani, Polynesian, Fiji Islander, Tahitian, Thai, or similar           responses.  Census basic records include codes for over 50 separate           groups within this category.  In complete-count tabulations, this           group is part of the ""Other races"" category described below.            Other (Race n.e.c. ""not elsewhere classified"").  Includes all other           races (except ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander"" groups) which were           not included in the specific categories listed on the           questionnaire.  For example, persons reporting in the ""Other"" race           category and providing write-in entries such as Eurasian,           Cosmopolitan, Inter-racial, or a Spanish origin group (e.g.,           Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican) were included in Race, n.e.c.           (NOTE-  These groups were also included in the ""Other"" race           category in complete count tabulations.  However, other Asian and           Pacific Islander groups are included in the ""Other"" category in           100-percent tabulations only.)  STF 3, STF 4, and public-use           microdata samples separately identify, as a subcategory within           ""Race, n.e.c.,"" persons who wrote in an entry implying Spanish           origin.  Such entries are not necessarily consistent with responses           in the Spanish origin question.            In a few tables in which data for American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut,           and Asian and Pacific Islander are not presented separately, the           ""Other"" category encompasses all race categories not shown           separately.            In some tabulations, the ""other"" or ""Race, n.e.c."" category is           omitted to save space; data for this category are derivable by           subtracting the sum of the specified race categories from the total.   On certain printed tables, where space is limited, data for persons of  Spanish Origin are presented alongside data for up to four major race  groups.  In such situations, users should not be misled by the proximity of  these two types of data.  Spanish origin is not a race category, and persons  of Spanish origin may be of any race.  Tabulations in a number of sources  present data separately for race categories (.e.g, White, Black, and  ""Other"") for persons not of Spanish origin.  In addition, the number of  Spanish-origin persons is given by race.   Limitations:  In previous censuses, undercoverage of the population has been  associated with race.  The 1970 census missed Blacks at a much higher rate  than Whites.  The Bureau has not prepared undercoverage rates for races  other than White or Black, because vital records and other sources of  relevant statistics do not consistently distinguish among other races.   Historical comparability:  Questions on ""race"" or ""color"" have been asked in  each census since 1970.  In 1970, when persons with parents of different  races were in doubt as to their classification, the race of the father was  used.  In 1980, the race of the mother was used for persons who could not  provide a single response.  The 1970 category ""Negro or Black"" has been  retitled ""Black or Negro.""  Individual categories for Vietnamese, Asian  Indian, Guamanian, and Samoan were added.  In 1970, the categories Eskimo  and Aleut appeared only on questionnaires used in Alaska; they were replaced  by Hawaiian and Korean in all other States.  In 1980, all four categories  appeared on the questionnaire.  As a result of the additions, the 1980  questionnaire had 14 specific race categories instead of 8 as in 1970.   In 1970, persons who did not report a specific race but wrote in Hispanic  categories such as ""Mexican,"" ""Puerto Rican,"" or ""Cuban"" in the race  question were assigned to White; for 1980 these persons remain in the ""Other  races"" category.   See also:  SPANISH ORIGIN.   REGION (CENSUS GEOGRAPHIC).  A large group of States which is a first-order  subdivision of the United States for census purposes.  The four  regions--Northeast, North Central, South, and West--are delineated in figure  5.  Regions are identified by a 1-digit code.  Statistics for them appear in  U.S. Summary reports in almost every publication series, and in STF's 1C,  2C, 3C, 4C, and 5C.  The census regions have no relationship to the 10  Standard Federal Administrative Regions.    S-Z   SPANISH ORIGIN.  Determined by a complete-count question which asks  respondents to self-identify whether they are of Spanish origin or descent.  If, when interviewed, the person reported a multiple origin and could not  provide a single origin, the origin of the person's mother was used.  If a  single response was not provided for the person's mother, the first reported  origin of the person was used.   Persons marking any one of the four ""Spanish"" categories, i.e., Mexican,  Puerto Rican, Cuban, or other Spanish, are collectively referred to as  ""Persons of Spanish origin.""   In certain tabulations, persons of Spanish origin are further classified by  type:       Mexican.  Persons who indicated ""Mexican,  Mexican-American, Chicano,""      or wrote in an entry such as ""La Raza.""       Puerto Rican.  Persons who indicated ""Puerto Rican"" or wrote in an entry      such as Boricua.""       Cuban.  Persons who indicated ""Cuban.""       Other Spanish.  Persons who filled the circle for ""other      Spanish/Hispanic;"" or persons who wrote in an origin or descent      associated with Spain, the Dominican Republic, or any Central or South      America country except Brazil or a nonspecific Spanish group such as      ""Spanish surnamed"" or ""Spanish speaking.""   Preliminary evaluations of 1980 census data suggest some limited  misreporting of Spanish origin.  Available evidence indicates that the  misreporting may have occurred only in selected areas with relatively small  Spanish-origin populations, such as in some Southern States, but it is not  apparent in those areas with the largest concentrations of Spanish-origin  persons.  For a fuller discussion of the reporting in the Spanish-origin  item, see the 1980 census Supplementary Report, ""Persons of Spanish Origin  by State:  1980"" (PC80-S1-7).   Historical comparability:  The Spanish-origin question was asked on a  100-percent basis for the first time in 1980.  A similar question was asked  on the 1970 5-percent sample questionnaire.  For 1980, the category ""no, not  Spanish/Hispanic"" appeared first (the corresponding category appeared last  in 1970).  Also, the terms ""Mexican-American"" and ""Chicano"" are added to the  term ""Mexican.""  The category Central or South American,"" included in 1970,  has been dropped.   Although a question on Spanish origin was included in 1970, it was not the  major identifier used to classify the Hispanic population in the 1970 census  as it is in 1980.  Depending on the section of the country, 1970 census data  for ""Persons of Spanish Heritage"" were variously defined as ""Persons of  Puerto Rican Birth or Parentage"" (in New York, New Jersey, and  Pennsylvania); as ""Persons of Spanish Language or Spanish Surname"" (in  Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas); and as ""Persons of  Spanish Language"" (in the remaining 42 States and the District of  Columbia).  ""Spanish Language"" referred to those persons who in 1970  reported Spanish as their mother tongue, as well as persons in families in  which the household head or spouse reported Spanish as his or her mother  tongue.   STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREA (SCSA).  A large concentration of  metropolitan population composed of two or more contiguous standard  metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's) which together meet certain criteria  of population size, urban character, social and economic integration, and/or  contiguity of urbanized areas.  Each SCSA must have a population of one  million or more.  Thirteen SCSA's were in existence at the time of the 1980  census.  They were defined by the Office of Management and Budget According  to criteria published by that office in Standard Metropolitan Statistical  Areas:  1975.  Four additional SCSA's have been defined based on 1980 census  results.  Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas:  1975.  Four additional  SCSA's have been defined based on 1980 census results.   SCSA's are identified by a 2-digit numeric code.  Summaries for SCSA's  appear in many reports and in STF's 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, and 5C.  Summaries are  generally provided for SCSA totals and for within-State parts of SCSA's.   Historical comparability:  The original 13 SCSA's were designated in 1975.  For the 1960 and 1970 censuses, the Census Bureau recognized two ""Standard  Consolidated Areas"" (SCA's), which encompassed metropolitan complexes around  New York and Chicago.   In 1983, the SCSA concept will be replaced by the new Consolidated  Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) concept, with somewhat more flexible  criteria, as spelled out in the Federal Register, January 3, 1980.  These  changes will not affect publication of the 1980 census data for SCSA's.   STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (SMSA).  A large population nucleus  and nearby communities which have a high degree of economic and social  integration with that nucleus.  Each SMSA consists of one or more entire  counties (or county equivalents) that meet specified standards pertaining to  population, commuting ties, and metropolitan character.  In New England,  towns and cities, rather than counties, are the basic units and should be  substituted for ""counties"" where counties are cited below.  SMSA's are  designated by the Office of Management and Budget.   Data products from the 1980 census will report on 323 SMSA's:  (1) 287  defined before January 1, 1980 (including 4 in Puerto Rico); and (2) an  additional 36 (including one in Puerto Rico) established as a result of 1980  census population counts.  The 36 new SMSA's were designated when 1980  counts showed that they met one or both of the following criteria:       1.  Included a city with a population of at least 50,000 within its          corporate limits, or       2.  Included a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area (which must have a          population of at least 50,000) and a total SMSA population of at          least 100,000 (or, in New England, 75,000).   An SMSA includes a city and, generally, its entire UA and the remainder of  the county or counties in which the UA is located.  An SMSA also includes  such additional outlying counties which meet specified criteria relating to  metropolitan character and level of commuting of workers into the central  city or counties.  Specific criteria governing the definition of SMSA's  recognized before 1980 are published in Standard Metropolitan Statistical  Areas:  1975, issued by the Office of Management and Budget.   With two exceptions, each SMSA has one or more central cities, up to a  maximum of three, and the names of these cities comprise the title, and of  the SMSA.  The Nassau-Suffolk, NY SMSA has no central city, and the title of  the Northeast Pennsylvania SMSA does not contain the names of and three  central cities:  Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton.   SMSA's are identified by a FIPS 4-digit numeric code, which follows the  alphabetic sequence of SMSA names.  SMSA's are outlined on small-scale maps  in several 1980 report series.  SMSA data appear in most 1980 census  publications and summary tape files.  Many SMSA's cross State boundaries,  and reports in several series provide summaries for the State parts of  multi-State SMSA's, as well as SMSA totals.  Summary tape files present data  only for State parts of SMSA's, except for the ""national"" files:  STF's 1C,  2C, 3C, and 4C.   Historical comparability:  A comparison of 1970 and 1980 census products  reveals two types of changes in metropolitan territory.  First, 69 new  SMSA's were created from previously nonmetropolitan territory:  36 were  defined in 1981 based on 1980 population counts and 33 were defined between   1973 and 1979 based on current population estimates.  (An additional  SMSA--Rapid City, SD--was provisionally recognized based on population  estimates, but it did not qualify according to 1980 census data.)   The second component of change to metropolitan territory between 1970 and  1980 was the redefinition of many of the SMSA's which were recognized in  1970 census tabulations.  Of the 247 1970 SMSA's, 101 were redefined in 1973  based on 1970 census commuting data, most by the addition of one or more  counties (or towns and cities in New England).  In addition, one SMSA was  redefined by the addition of one area and the deletion of another (Wichita  Falls, Texas), one was subdivided (Nassau-Suffolk SMSA was created from a  part of the New York SMSA), four pairs of SMSA's were combined into single  SMSA's (for example, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas), and four SMSA's lost area  that was added to other SMSA's.  In addition, the names of several SMSA's  were changed in 1973, one in such a way that the SMSA code also changed (San  Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario to Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario,  California).   Since SMSA's are always defined in terms of whole counties (towns or cities  in New England) for which extensive data are available, users can usually  compile figures for comparisons over time.   In 1983, SMSA boundaries will be re-evaluated using 1980 census data on  commuting, labor force, population density, type of residence, and  population growth, according to new criteria spelled out in the Federal  Register, January 3, 1980 (vol. 45, no. 2, pt. VI).  At that ime, new  outlying counties may be added or existing ones deleted, some area titles  will be changed, some new central cities will be designated, some areas may  be consolidated, and a few new SMSA's may be created.  Further, the term  ""standard metropolitan statistical area"" will be shortened to ""metropolitan  statistical area"" (MSA).  These changes will not affect publication of 1980  census data for SMSA's.   STATE.  The major political unit of the United States.  The District of  Columbia is treated as a State-equivalent in all 1980 census data series.  Puerto Rico is also, except that it does not appear in the P.L. 94-171  population counts file.  American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the  remainder of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands are treated as State equivalents for the presentation of data from  1980 census volume 1 reports, but data for these areas will be available on  computer tape only on STF's 1 and 3.  States are identified by a 2-digit  FIPS code which follows the alphabetic sequence of State names (including  the District of Columbia), and by a 2-digit census geographic State code,  the first digit of which identifies the census division of which the State  is a part.  Puerto Rico and the outlying areas have FIPS codes numerally  following the State codes.   Historical comparability:  There have been no significant changes to State  boundaries in the last decade.  Data for the Northern Mariana Islands are  reported separately from the remainder of the Trust Territory for the 1980  census.   See also:  PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.   STATE ECONOMIC AREA (SEA).  A single county or group of counties within a  State, which is relatively homogeneous with respect to economic and social  characteristics.  The grouping of the 3,103 counties or county equivalents  in 1950 into SEA's was the product of a special study prepared by the Bureau  of the Census in cooperation with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and  several State and private agencies.  Boundaries were drawn in such a manner  that each economic area had certain significant characteristics which  distinguished it from adjoining areas.  There are 510 SEA's.   SEA's are identified in census tabulations on computer tape by a 2-digit  numeric code or a 1-digit alphabetic code, assigned sequentially within the  State; however, no 1980 data are tabulated for SEA's.   Historical comparability:  SEA boundaries have remained largely unchanged  since they were defined in 1950.  In 1950, 501 areas were defined; in 1960,  509; and in 1970, 510.   See also:  ECONOMIC SUBREGION (ESR).   TENURE.  The classification of all occupied units as either owner-occupied  or renter-occupied.  This item was asked on a complete-count basis.       Owner-occupied.  A housing unit is ""owner occupied"" if the owner or      co-owner lives in the unit even if the unit is mortgaged or not fully      paid for.       Renter-occupied.  All occupied housing units which are not      owner-occupied, regardless of whether or not cash rent is paid by a      member of the household.  (""No cash rent"" units, a subcategory of      renter-occupied, are separately identified in rent tabulations.  Such      units are generally provided free by friends or relatives, or in      exchange for the services of, for example, a caretaker, minister, tenant      farmer, or sharecropper.)   Historical comparability:  Tenure has been collected since 1890.  In 1970,  the question on tenure also included a category for condominium and  cooperative ownership.  In 1980, condominiums are identified in a separate  question.   TOWN/TOWNSHIP.  See MINOR CIVIL DIVISION.   TRACT.  See CENSUS TRACT.   UNITED STATES.  This designation includes the 50 States and the District of  Columbia.  STF's and most report series (usually in a separate U.S. Summary  report) provide data summarized for the United States.   URBAN AND RURAL (POPULATION).  Urban and rural are type-of-area concepts  rather than specific areas outlined on maps.  As defined by the Census  Bureau, the urban population comprises all persons living in urbanized areas  (UA's) and in places of 2,500 or more inhabitants outside UA's.   The rural population consists of everyone else.  Therefore, a rural  classification need not imply farm residence or a sparsely settled area,  since a small city or town is rural as long as it is outside a UA and has  fewer than 2,500 inhabitants.   The terms urban and rural are independent of metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan designations; both urban and rural areas occur inside and  outside SMSA's.   Historical comparability:  Except for the minor relaxation of UA criteria  discussed below, urban and rural definitions have been consistent since  1950.  Within small counties, measurements of urban and rural populations  over time may be significantly affected by the increase or decrease of a  place's population across the 2,500 population threshold, e.g., the increase  of 1 person to a place of 2,499 results in an increase of 2,500 to the  county's urban population.   URBAN FRINGE.  See URBANIZED AREA.   URBANIZED AREA (UA).  A population concentration of at least 50,000  inhabitants, generally consisting of a central city and the surrounding,  closely settled, contiguous territory (suburbs).   The UA criteria define a boundary based primarily on a population density of  at least 1,000 persons per square mile, but also include some less densely  settled areas within corporate limits, and such areas as industrial parks  and railroad yards, if they are within areas of dense urban development.  The density level of 1,000 persons per square mile corresponds approximately  to the continuously built-up area around a city.  The ""urban fringe"" is that  part of the UA outside of a central city.   Typically, an entire UA is included within an SMSA.  The SMSA is usually  much larger in terms of territory covered and includes territory where the  population density is less than 1,000.  Occasionally, more than one UA is  located within an SMSA.  In some cases a small part of a UA may extend  beyond an SMSA boundary and possibly into an adjacent SMSA.  A few 1980 UA's  will be defined in areas which do not meet the criteria for SMSA  designation.  UA's may cross State boundaries.  In a few cases, a UA does  not include all of an ""extended"" city, that is, a city which is determined  to have a significant amount of rural territory.   UA's are identified by 4-digit codes, which follow the alphabetic sequence  of all UA names.  When a UA has the same name as an SMSA, the UA code is the  same as the SMSA code.  UA boundaries are shown on final MMS/VMS maps, and  at much smaller scale on UA outline maps in PC80-1-A and HC80-1-A reports.   Historical comparability:  Because UA's are defined on the basis of  population distribution at the time of a decennial census, their boundaries  tend to change following each census to include expanding urban development.   The criteria have been fairly constant since 1950, although in each decade  some new refinements have been added.  For the 1970 census, in which 252  UA's were recognized, it was necessary for the central city to have a  population of 50,000 or more, or for there to be ""twin cities"" with a  combined population of 50,000 and with the smaller city having at least  15,000.  In 1974, the criteria were liberalized to allow UA recognition to  certain cities between 25,000 and 50,000, and this resulted in 27 new  urbanized areas.  For 1980, no minimum population size is required for a  central city.   WARD.  Political subdivision of a city used for voting and representation  purposes.  For 1980, in approximately 900 places of 10,000 inhabitants or  more and approximately 300 nonblock-numbered places, ward boundaries were  observed in the definition of enumeration districts (ED's).  For these  areas, users may prepare ward data by summarizing ED data.  In areas with  block statistics, users may prepare ward data by summarizing block data.   Historical comparability:  Population counts for wards in places with a  population of 10,000 or more appeared in Supplementary Reports, PC-S1, in  1960 and 1970.   WHITE POPULATION.  See RACE.

Want a profile of potential customers in your neighborhood?  Answers to these and other questions can be found by using the data compiled by the 2000 Census - if you know how and where to look.                   Two public workshops on ""Using Census 2000 Data for Your Individual Needs"" are being offered on Oahu in March that are designed to help maximize the new Census 2000 data.                     ""These workshops will be especially valuable for those needing information on small areas of the state,"" said DBEDT Director Seiji Naya.  ""We now have a wide range of data available for Hawaii's many ethnic groups down to the census block level.""                   The workshops will highlight the uses of census data for                                      Business site locations and marketing;                  Funding proposals;                  Analyzing neighborhoods for social service delivery and planning;                  Studying communities for needs assessment.                                  Comprehensive ethnic data are also available for small areas of the state.  For instance, through the census you can find such detailed information as the number of:                                      Male and female Native Hawaiians in Nanakuli;                  Single-parent Japanese families in Hilo;                           Korean children in the 96813 zip code area;           Filipino homeowners in the Puhi-Hanamaulu area; and much more.                                  The census workshops will present an in-depth look at data from Summary File 1, which contains such characteristics as household relationship, sex, age, race, Hispanic origin, tenure, and vacancy characteristics for all households in your geographical area of interest.  The workshops will also look at newly released data from Summary File 2 for Hawaii, which provides the same type of characteristics as Summary File 1 but by detailed race groups such as Native Hawaiian, Japanese, Samoans, Filipinos, Koreans and other groups down to block levels.                    Data access through the Internet will also be emphasized in these sessions.  The Internet is the primary method being used by the Census Bureau to distribute its Census 2000 data.  Users are now able to extract the data they need through their office or home computers using a menu-driven system on the Census Bureau Internet site.  Only 10 percent of the Census 2000 data will be published in hard-copy form, so learning to access data on the Internet is critical.                   The agenda will include:                                      Basic census terminology and Hawaii census geography;                  Description and applications of the Summary File 1 & 2 data;                  Obtaining information for your own needs - generating small area profiles, finding state rankings, locating computer maps;                  Demonstration of the Census Bureau's Internet site and other sites containing Census 2000 data;                  Preview of the social and economic data to be released later this year;                  Schedule of Census 2000 products to be released; and                  Local sources of Census 2000 data.                                  Social and economic data for Hawaii from the Census 2000 are not yet available, but will be released later this year.  Workshop participants will learn about the type of data that will be forthcoming  (i.e., income, language spoken at home, educational attainment, occupation), the level of geography for the data, what format the data will be released in, timetable, and other information.                   The workshop presenter will be Mr. Jerry Wong, Information Specialist with the L.A. Regional Office of the Census Bureau.  Mr. Wong has been with the Census Bureau for 23 years and has worked on three decennial censuses.  He has extensive experience working with and educating community groups, businesses, elected officials and the media of the demographic and economic uses of census data.                   The workshops are being co-sponsored by DBEDT's Hawaii State Data Center, the Hawaii Small Business Development Center, and the Los Angeles Regional Office of the U.S. Census Bureau.

GX237-20-6381544	"BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Bureau of the Census Mission Statement To be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.  T  he Bureau of the Census's mission is built around its large-scale surveys and censuses. This involves the full range of activities required to produce data, including survey and questionnaire design and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis will directly support the Census Bureau's capabilities to conduct large-scale surveys and censuses. Through strategic planning, the Census Bureau evaluates how best to accomplish this mission. The strategic plan provides a framework for articulating program goals and builds these goals through consensus. The planning process promotes synergy, innovation, and eff iciency, and represents a better way of doing business. The goal of the Census Bureau is to provide the best mix of timeliness, relevancy, quality, and cost for the data collected and services provided. The data provided by the Census Bureau shape important policy decisions that help improve our nation's social and economic conditions: Census data are used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding. Census data provide the basis for estimating the gross domestic product and leading economic indicators. Census data determine the apportionment of Congressional seats, as mandated in the Constitution. Census data inform about education, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. National, state, and local governments use Census data to formulate policy. Large cor porations and local businesses use Census data to devise their business plans. To accomplish its mission, the Census Bureau depends on actions that: Provide the U.S.'s off icial measures on monthly unemployment, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as economic indicators that include housing starts, retail and wholesale trade sales, international trade, manufacturers' shipments, orders, and inventories, and quarterly estimates of cor porate prof its. Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures against which most data-based decisions and activities take place. Reengineer the 2010 Decennial Census of Population and Housing to be more eff icient and cost-effective, provide richer and more timely data, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  119   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Invest in statistical methodological research and new technologies to improve cur rent operations and prepare for the future. Continue to provide strict security of census information, address privacy issues, and foster program goals while maintaining conf identiality of census information.  Priorities/Management Challenges To deliver high value, the Bureau must target measurement on those trends and segments of our population and economy most critical to continued U.S. success and prosperity. During FY 2002, the Census Bureau focused activities in these areas through a variety of priority program efforts that continue and improve ongoing statistical programs. They included distributing Census 2000 data, planning the 2010 Census, obtaining cyclical economic data through the Economic Censuses and the Census of Governments, and completing data collection for the 2001 American Community Survey (ACS). Greater resistance to authority, continued decline in trust of government, and a greater demand for quality have complicated the Census Bureau's data gathering efforts and ability to maintain or increase response rates. The Bureau will have to continually demonstrate its expertise in educating the public on the quality and security of its data, and its ongoing sensitivity to anonymity and privacy issues. Surveys have shown that more people feel they have less time available to do what they need to do, including work, sleep, look after their families, and enjoy leisure. The Census Bureau will consider new approaches to saving customers' time and reduce respondent burden to ensure that the customers' needs are met. The Census Bureau will continue environments. The Bureau must use and timely information on emerging of criminal and/or malicious access to improve the use of technology in data collection, processing, and dissemination state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of the demand from policy makers for accurate economic and societal trends. As always, the Census Bureau will mitigate the possibility to all of its networks and data.  The Census Bureau's mission is ""to be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States. "" This mission has and will continue to be the Bureau's focus as the environment in which it works changes. FY 2002 Performance In FY 2002, the Census Bureau had three goals and seven measures. Of those seven measures, the Bureau met all of them. The performance measures focused on providing and improving cur rent measures of the U.S. population, economy, and governments; timely release of Decennial Census products; and the implementation of the 2010 Decennial Census. Census Bureau performance in FY 2002 included meeting the target for the percentage completion of its housing unit address list. Having a complete housing unit address list is critical for conducting an accurate 2010 Decennial Census. The Bureau has also successfully released 2001 data from the long form transitional database, which is important for the implementation of the ACS. The Census Bureau successfully met all the measures associated with the goals in the FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan.  120  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Targets and Performance Summary See individual Performance Goal section for further description of each measure.

(This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as:""Develop relevant, accurate and timely, national and community economic and household statistics for decision-making"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.  Rationale for Performance Goal Demographic Statistics: The Census Bureau's demographic statistics program staff is responsible for developing plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory. The Bureau undertakes analytical research on emerging issues and trends, such as the condition of children and the elderly, the employment of disabled individuals, and the characteristics of immigrants. Directing and coordinating technical and developmental work on the collection and analysis of data by race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry are major responsibilities. This work results in reports on the characteristics of special population groups and on American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Village areas. An important aspect is examining reporting issues, such as er ror or bias in these data. Off icial statistics on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as longitudinal data on income and program participation that federal agencies use to develop, modify, and monitor income transfer programs, come from demographic programs. Especially important are data necessary to determine the impact of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, often called welfare reform. Demographic program staffers conduct much of the foundational analysis and research underlying the U.S. Off ice of Management and Budget's (OMB's) decisions on national statistical standards on topics such as occupational classif ications, metropolitan areas, and race and ethnicity. The demographic programs also plan and conduct surveys and special censuses, funded by other federal agencies that focus on topics of national importance, such as unemployment, crime, health, education, and consumer expenditures.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  125   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Economic Statistics: The Bureau's economic statistics program staff is responsible for statistical programs that count and prof ile U.S. businesses and government organizations in a rapidly evolving economic environment. This includes conducting Economic Censuses and a Census of Governments every f ive years; car rying out more than 100 separate surveys monthly, quarterly, and annually, including principal economic indicators; producing voluminous merchandise export and import statistics monthly; accomplishing extensive compilations of administrative records; and undertaking numerous research and technical studies. In addition, economic statistics program staffers conduct a number of surveys under reimbursable agreements with other federal agencies such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The major activities of the economic statistics programs include: Providing statistics that are critical to understanding cur rent conditions in the U.S. economy, including principal federal economic indicators Producing economic statistics that provide seventy-f ive percent of the source data used in preparing gross domestic product estimates, one of the nation's most important barometers of cur rent economic activity Providing information on the labor, capital, and material inputs to, as well as the outputs of, the nation's manufacturing, mining, and construction industries Conducting company-based surveys for the collection of f inancial data, including data on capital investment, income, payroll, assets, and expenditures Collecting, processing, and compiling statistical data relating to U.S. merchandise trade (exports, imports, and transportation) with foreign countries and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; detailed trade information is available on both a monthly and annual basis for 17,000 import commodities and 10,000 export commodities Conducting annual sample surveys of state and local government f inances and employment and producing quarterly measures of taxes and government assets Conducting surveys for other government agencies related to federal, state, and local government activities Undertaking reimbursable activities (surveys and special tabulations) that take advantage of the economic program's processing infrastructure and core competencies. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance levels for all measures were achieved. In collaboration with business and government entities, the focus of activity for FY 2002 was the development of collection instruments. Specif ic activities included the printing of millions of report forms and the development of processing systems. The Census Bureau also developed an electronic reporting infrastructure to allow the option of electronic reporting of 3.5 million businesses and established a 24/7 Internet site to provide assistance to 2002 Economic Census respondents.  126  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  During FY 2002, the Census Bureau's demographic statistics program staff successfully developed and implemented plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory. The 2001 data products for the thirty-one test sites for the American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2001 Supplementary Survey were published. Other surveys which measured housing characteristics, such as home ownership, income, poverty, family composition, and the socioeconomic characteristics of race and ethnic groups were successfully completed.

These measurements consist of a series of statistical measurements that def ine the precision of a survey--e.g., standard er ror, coeff icient of variation, and sample design effect. The customer and the Census Bureau jointly determine reliability specif ications before the survey is commissioned. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. Reliability measurements are fundamental to the success and customer acceptance of Census Bureau survey information. We maintain these reliability measures as the surveys are conducted and their results are released  Measure 1b: 1) Household Response Rate for the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the American Housing Survey. 2) Response Rate for the National Health Interview Survey. 3) Household Response Rate for the Survey of Income and Program Participation FY 1999 Target1 Actual Met/Not Met 100% 100% Met  FY 2000 100% 100% Met  FY 2001 100% 100% Met  FY 2002 100% 100% Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage of household surveys with initial response rates > 90%."") 1  See italicized statement above regarding rewording of the measure and recharacterization of the associated targets. The Bureau met 100% of the stated target of obtaining response rates better than 90%. For FY2002, this measure included response rates for the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the American Community Survey.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  127   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Explanation of Measure Maintaining a high response rate for household surveys ensures that the Bureau's survey information is always reliable, comparable, and widely accepted by customers over the longer term. Since the sample design, interview content, length, and respondent rules vary by survey and are cor related with response rates, our target measures are different: (1) The Cur rent Population Survey (CPS), the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the American Housing Survey, can maintain a ninety percent or better response rate. These households have rotating address-based panels and are usually contacted by a Field Representative (FR) in person when they f irst enter the sample and remain in sample for repeated visits over a prescribed period of time. The rotating design also ensures that there is a mix of new and returning households which serves to stabilize response rates over time. FRs can make subsequent contacts by appointment and by telephone if the respondent wishes. Households that move are not followed; the new occupants are eligible for the interview. This methodology, coupled with an interview lasting from ten to forty minutes depending on the household size, is conducive to maximizing response rates. However, response rates across all surveys, regardless of design and content, have been declining in recent years as we compete with other surveys and demands on the public's time. (2) The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) uses a different design in that a household is in the sample only once, the FR has a short interval of time to conduct the interview, and the average interview length is sixty minutes, hence the lower target response rate of eighty-seven percent. (3) The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is on average a sixty-minute household interview and collects information on income, assets, transfer program participation, and various other socio-economic topics. Since 1996, the SIPP has had ""abutting"" rather than overlapping panels which means that at any given time, all households have been in sample for the same time period, i.e., there is no replenishment of sample as in the CPS, NCVS, and AHS designs. In addition, respondents are interviewed every four months, are encouraged to consult their records and to report their social security number to ensure accurate data, and are followed to new locations if they move during the life of the panel which is usually three to four years. These design features, particularly the requirement to follow original household members, have contributed to shar p declines in panel response rates in recent years. The Census Bureau has taken several steps to maximize response such as monetary incentives, redesigned introductory letters and materials, and enhanced FR training. The target response rates consider the age of the panel in the appropriate year. The FY 2001 performance level for this measure was achieved as the measure was then worded. In FY 2001, the initial response rates for the Cur rent Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the American Community Survey were all greater than ninety percent. There were no changes to the FY 2002 Performance Plan, but beginning in FY 2003 the measure was expanded to include longitudinal surveys for which the high initial response rates are diff icult to maintain over time. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. The Census Bureau was able to achieve an initial response rate of ninety percent or greater for our cross-sectional household surveys. This measure excludes household expenditure surveys. These response rates are developed during the data collection phase of the survey.  128  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Measure 1c: 1) Release Data Products from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and 2) the Survey of Program Dynamics (see the ""Explanation of Measure"" Section for Data Products List) FY 1999 Target Actual Met/Not Met 5% time decrease 9% time decrease Met  FY 2000 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  FY 2001 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  FY 2002 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage reduction from time of data collection to data release for selected household surveys."")  Explanation of Measure The Bureau has achieved optimal release times for many long-standing household surveys; for example, the Bureau releases data from the American Housing Survey nine months after collection. Other household surveys have different schedules based on their designs. This measure addresses newer surveys and survey supplements, such as SIPP and the Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD). For SIPP, the Bureau was able to maintain the nine percent time reduction that was established in FY 1999 (the SPD was not part of the measure in FY 2001 or FY 2002). SIPP collects a ""core"" of data items on detailed income, program participation, and work experience at four-month intervals from a cohort of households that are in the sample for approximately three years. Each four-month interval is refer red to as a ""wave"" of interviewing and in addition to the core items, questions measuring other aspects of household economic and social well-being are included as ""topical modules"" during each wave. The core data supplies longitudinal (studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time) measures over the life of the panel while the topical module data supplies cross-sectional (studies that focus on phenomena that occur during a precise time interval, such as a calendar year) measures at one or more points in time. SPD -- The SPD is a follow-on survey conducted with SIPP respondents from the 1992 and 1993 panels who were last interviewed in 1995 and 1996, respectively, to comply with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. The bureau was able to maintain the production time schedule as was achieved in FY 1999 for SIPP and SPD. This schedule was established as part of the project management tools for the programs. Measure 1d: Release Principal Economic Indicators FY 1999 Target Actual Met/Not Met New  FY 2000 New  FY 2001 New  FY 2002 100% on time 100% on time Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage of principal economic indicators released as scheduled."")  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  129   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Explanation of Measure This was a new specif ic performance measure for FY 2002. The Census Bureau provides statistics that are critical to understanding cur rent conditions in our economy. These statistics include the principal federal economic indicators that drive national monetary policy, federal economic policymaking and investment, and business decisions. These principal economic indicators include the Advance Retail Sales; Manufacturing and Trade: Inventories and Sales; Monthly Wholesale Trade; Advanced Report on Durable Goods, Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders; Construction Put in Place; Quarterly Financial Report (QFR): Manufacturing, Mining, and Wholesale Trade; New Residential Construction; New Residential Sales; QFR: Retail; Housing Vacancies; and the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, jointly released with the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Previously, the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services measure was reported in the BEA's Annual Program Performance Report and Annual Performance Plan with reference to the Census Bureau's data collection and processing responsibilities. OMB statistical directive no. 3 requires that data for Census Bureau principal economic indicators be released within prescribed time periods. For most monthly indicators this means that they must be made available within one month of the end of the reference period, and for the quarterly indicators within two and a half months. Release dates for these indicators are available online at www.census.gov/epcd/econ/www/indijun.htm. Our goal is to release all 116 monthly and quarterly principal economic indicators on time. FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time. The Census Bureau's principal economic indicators are among some of the most important and closely followed statistics generated by the federal statistical system. These indicators provide government policymakers and private decisionmakers with timely information about the cur rent performance of the U.S. economy. During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time.  Program Evaluation The Census Bureau's statistical program evaluations are numerous and ongoing. One measure the Bureau uses to determine data reliability is initial response rates. One measure the Bureau uses to determine timeliness is the elapsed time from data collection to data release. The following are some examples of Census Bureau program evaluations.  Demographic Statistics The Census Bureau regularly generates quality prof iles and management reports for both reimbursable and Bureau-sponsored demographic surveys. These prof iles and reports provide statistical measures of reliability and note compliance with or accomplishment of project tasks. Economic Statistics Evaluation of programs by the economic statistics staff has led to better measures of capital expenditures by U.S. companies, improved the Bureau's ability to capture data on e-commerce activities, clarif ied the information companies can provide on their pollution abatement activities, and periodically documented, as required by OMB, the statistical rigor of the methodologies used to produce the principal economic indicators.  130  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 2: Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures of the population, economy, and government that meet the needs of policy makers, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, businesses and the public. (This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as:""Conduct the Decennial Census (FY 2000, FY 2001, and FY 2002"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.  Rationale for Performance Goal The Census Bureau's benchmark programs are a major source of baseline information upon which most data-based decisions and activities take place. Whether gathered through the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, the upcoming 2002 and 2007 Economic Censuses and the 2002 and 2007 Census of Governments, or the Intercensal Demographic Estimates that provide baseline demographic information in between the decennial censuses, the Census Bureau's Benchmark programs are where everyone turns to for information. The demographic programs provide the data used by the states and other agencies to allocate nearly $200 billion dollars in federal funds each year, conduct the analyses that underlie the statistical def initions and standards used by the entire federal government in policy decisions, and establish the baseline sample units that underlie virtually every survey conducted in the United States by both private and public sectors. The economic statistics programs count and prof ile U.S. businesses and government organizations in a rapidly-evolving economic environment. They include conducting an Economic Census and a Census of Governments every f ive years. The Economic Census covers all nonagricultural sectors of the economy, publishes data on the activities of more than twenty-two million businesses and more than 1,100 industries, and provides detailed geographic information. As a complement to the sectoral Economic Census program components, the Census Bureau also conducts a series of related programs to collect information on topics of special interest, for example, minority and women-owned businesses, the characteristics of the nation's trucking fleet, business expenses, the flow of commodities, and the economies of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Census of Governments represents the primary source of facts about the structure and function of the public sector of the U.S. economy. It provides essential information to Congress and federal agencies for planning and evaluating programs that involve intergovernmental relationships. The census contributes an important element for constructing composite national economic measures, such as gross domestic product, the Bureau of Economic Analysis's input-output tables that measure market sectors, and the Federal Reserve Board's flow of funds accounts that provide time-series data of f inancial flows in the economy. The Census of Governments' f indings supply vital analytical tools for a wide variety of data users. Among the most prominent are state and local government off icials, educational organizations, criminal justice organizations, public interest groups, private industry, economic research agencies, and the media.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  131   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 2 focuses on the major conduct and dissemination milestones for the 2002 Economic and Government Censuses and providing improved demographic intercensal estimates. Specif ic performance goals and measures related to these activities include Publishing and disseminating data from the 2002 Economic Census and the 2002 Census of Governments on a timely, scheduled basis Mailing Survey of Business Owners forms for the 2002 Economic Census FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, measures for this goal were successfully met. During FY 2002 the Census Bureau continued to produce and deliver data products from Census 2000. This includes Summary File 3 (SF3), which consists of over 800 detailed tables of Census 2000 social, economic, and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately nineteen million housing units that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire. The Census 2000 SF3 tables have been produced signif icantly earlier in the census cycle relative to previous decennial censuses. The SF3 f iles are used for the distribution of federal funds each year as well as a myriad of other public and private sector planning and decision-making uses. All planned data product releases for FY 2002 were completed on schedule.

This measure was previously worded as: ""Disseminate Census 2000 products."")  Explanation of Measure Providing releases of Census 2000 products on schedule is critical to the institutions and individuals responsible for managing or evaluating federal programs. The releases are also needed to meet legal requirements stemming from U.S. court decisions, such as the Voting Rights Act. The data collected and released are as much a part of the nation's infrastructure as highways and telephone lines. Federal dollars supporting schools, employment services, housing assistance, highway construction, hospital services, programs for the elderly, and more are distributed based on Census data. For example, twenty-two of the twenty-f ive largest federal funding grant programs in f iscal year 1998 were responsible for $162 billion being distributed to state, local, and tribal governments. About half of this money was distributed using formulas involving Census population data, according to the General Accounting Off ice. The Bureau expects that at least $182 billion and housing will be distributed annually based on formulas using Census 2000 data.  Program Evaluation The continued dissemination of data products to federal, state, local and tribal governments, as well as to users in the private and public sectors make them available for countless applications. Some uses of the data include the resolution of population and boundary issues, and the distribution of federal dollars to states and localities to meet their needs.  132  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 3: Re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census to be more efficient and cost effective, provide richer data, improve coverage, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates. (This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as: ""Def ine--through consultations, policy assessment, planning, research, experiments, and evaluations--the plan for the 2010 Census"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably  Rationale for Performance Goal Despite the fact that Census 2000 was an operational success, it was conducted with high costs and at great operational risk. In 2010, the job will be even more complex. Given the rapid demographic and technological changes experienced in recent years and the strong expectation that such changes will continue to accelerate, once-a-decade data collection and updating operations are no longer suff icient. Without a more systematic, timely, and integrated planning and design strategy, the data collection mission of the Census Bureau, especially of the 2010 Census, will be jeopardized. The Census Bureau has developed a strategy to meet this challenge. The strategy for the 2010 Census is to reduce operational risks, improve accuracy, provide more relevant data, and contain costs. Based on the fundamental approach of redesigning the 2010 Census, there are three interdependent components of this strategy: Implementation of the American Community Survey (ACS) to collect decennial census long-form information on an ongoing basis to provide for yearly/annual data products Modernization of The Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) address and geographic database that takes advantage of space-based technologies, such as satellite and aerial imagery and geographic information system (GIS) data from state, local, and tribal governments, to bring the MAF/TIGER system into alignment with Global Positioning System (GPS) information Systematic development, testing, and implementation of a short form only 2010 Census design that takes advantage of the opportunities offered by an enhanced MAF/TIGER and the American Community Survey. The Census Bureau planned implementation of the American Community Survey in 2003 so that by 2010 the Bureau can provide a reliable replacement for the long-form portion of the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau started exploring this design option after by limiting it to the collection of the basic data needed for Bureau would meet the data requirements of federal agencies a Continuous Measurement program. Although time did not the 1990 Census with the objective of simplifying Census 2000 apportionment and redistricting. Under this design, the Census as well as those of users outside the federal government through permit the development of a Continuous Measurement program  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  133   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  for Census 2000, developmental work was commissioned with an eye toward the 2010 Census. This work has continued resulting in the design of a system that can meet not only the federal mandates for data, but also can meet them with more timely and accurate data. This data collection effort, the American Community Survey, is a way to both improve coverage of the census (by way of operational simplif ication) and to reduce the operational risks of the census. The American Community Survey will provide the timely information needed for critical economic planning by governments and the private sector. In our information-based economy, federal, state, and local decision makers and private business and nonprof it organizations need cur rent, reliable, and comparable economic data to chart the future. The American Community Survey will provide up-to-date prof iles of U.S. communities every year beginning in 2004, providing policymakers, planners, and service providers in the public and private sectors with information every year--not just once every ten years. MAF/TIGER Modernization--The f ive objectives of the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program are to: 1 2 3 4 5  cor rect the locations of all streets, other map features, and required structures; develop a modern processing environment; enhance geographic partnerships; develop new methods to update the address list in predominately rural areas; and fully integrate quality assurance measures into the geographic and MAF/TIGER systems and databases to meet the needs of the 2010 Census (including the American Community Survey) and related early testing activities.  The new processing environment is needed to modernize a homegrown geographic database and to take advantage of commercially-available practices and technologies. The MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program will allow the ACS and the 2010 Census to take advantage of GPS technology and mobile computers to improve on outdated and er ror-prone methodologies, while substantially expanding geographic partnerships at the state, local, and tribal levels to maintain the completeness and accuracy of the information in the address and geographic systems that are essential for a successful 2010 Census. Ongoing address and geographic partnership programs coupled with technological improvements such as a GPS-linked system will help reduce the level of address duplication and geographic misassignment that was evident in Census 2000. Procedures will be streamlined and made more eff icient by providing f ield staff with tools and technology that enable them to greatly reduce such er rors in the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census will be armed with a more comprehensive, timely, and accurate address list--one of the best predictors of a successful census--without the added complexity, risk, and costs of last minute address list-building operations. 2010 Census planning, development, and testing--The objective of 2010 Census planning, development, and testing is to conduct early testing and prototyping of new and streamlined activities to take advantage of the fact that long form data will be collected by the ACS and therefore will not be needed as part of the 2010 short form collection effort; the MAF/TIGER Enhancement Program which will provide the Bureau with a system that is in GPS alignment; the results of the Census 2000 testing, experimentation, and evaluation program; and new research to build on the success of Census 2000.  134  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Both the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program and the American Community Survey are integral to a successful 2010 Census and, therefore, integral to the Census Bureau's planning activities. In addition, based on lessons learned from Census 2000, developing a design infrastructure that leads to early operational testing is crucial. This will require strong leadership, expert planning, sophisticated integration efforts, and oversight support. A major task is the development of the strategic framework to guide (1) interactions among the three components, (2) risk identif ication and management, (3) product development, (4) analysis of operational alternatives, (5) development of the research agendas, (6) integration of solutions into a logical design, and (7) plans for testing. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance levels for all measures were achieved. The Census Bureau completed the initial steps required for MAF/TIGER modernization including preparing a plan and systems to measure housing unit coverage. In FY 2002 the Bureau signed its f irst major contract with the Har ris Cor poration in the effort to re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census for the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project. Also in FY 2002, the Census Bureau successfully completed data collection for the 2001 ACS and the 2002 ACS through September, 2002. The Census Bureau completed all necessary data collection and data processing activities to be ready for expanding the ACS for 2003 into every county in the U.S. and every municipio in Puerto Rico.

This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage completion of housing unit address list."")  Explanation of Measure Cor rectly locating every street and other map features in the MAF/TIGER database is critical to providing geographic products and services that meet the accuracy expectations of the 2010 Census f ield data collection staff, the Census Bureau's data product customers, and the needs of The National Map/Homeland Defense effort. The Census Bureau's f ield staff has reported extensive diff iculties in completing address list updating and verif ication tasks, and in f inding addresses and streets that required follow-up visits in Census 2000. Many local or tribal governments that participated in the Census 2000 geographic partnership programs and many potential customers for MAF/TIGER geographic products have told the Census Bureau that they would not consider future geographic partnership or use without substantial improvements in location accuracy.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  135   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  FY 2002 Performance This performance measure was met. The Census Bureau has prepared an initial plan for measurement of housing unit coverage in the Master Address File (MAF). This plan documents the systems (Administrative Records System, Locatable Address Conversion System, Global Positioning System, Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument System) and data sources (Delivery Sequence Files, National Health Interview Survey f iles, Rural Directory f iles, E-911 f iles) that will provide the basis for developing the f ield procedures required to begin future data collection activities.

Met  Actual  Met/Not Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Release 2001 data from LFTB."")  Explanation of Measure The Census Long-Form Transitional Database (LFTDB) is the key to replacing the Census long form with the ACS. As part of the Decennial Census operations in FY 2000 and FY 2001, the Bureau has been conducting the LFTDB evaluation study. The FY 2002 plan for the LFTDB is a critical part of the transition to using data from the ACS as a national program beginning in FY 2003 (a performance measurement commitment in the Department of Commerce FY 2000FY 2005 Strategic Plan). When the ACS becomes a comprehensive national program, community prof iles will be available every year rather than every ten years. These vastly improved data will enable the U.S. government to distribute billions of dollars much more eff iciently and to more effectively evaluate federal programs. FY 2002 Performance Census completed all data collection for the 2001 LFTDB by January 2002. Data collection was completed across all three modes of collection with an overall response rate exceeding ninety-f ive percent. The data products also were produced, but the Census Bureau decided to delay release of these products until November 2002 because of the potential confusion with Census 2000 sample data products being released during the latter part of FY 2002.  136  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Census Data Validation and Verification The Bureau of the Census conducts an annual review of the performance data to ensure that projected targets are met. Data are verif ied by comparison with past release dates for those targets involving data release measures. The survey data tabulations are compared to publicly reported methodological standards for its surveys to verify that the specif ied measures are attained for targets involving reliability measures. During this process, signif icant deviations from projected targets, if any, are discussed with the appropriate program areas so that changes can be implemented to help meet the Census Bureau's performance goals. In some cases, information is manually checked against actual paper f iles (when available) to ensure the accuracy of information. Additionally, documentation is reviewed and a determination is made on its adequacy and suff iciency to support claims that outcomes and outputs have been achieved.
