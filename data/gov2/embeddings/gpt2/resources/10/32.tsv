Geographically, it is the                          furthest east of any country in the Sea (100 miles from                           St. Lucia ), not to mention                          one of the most diverse. Divided into eleven different                          parishes, they are each separate entities with different                          ways of life – moving from the capital city of  Bridgetown                           towards the  expensive villas                           to the west or to the busy bars of the south is as different                          as taking a ferry between, say,  Dominica                           and  Guadeloupe . Culturally,                          Barbados island is exceedingly British. Tea time, cricket                          matches and English pubs are firmly entrenched into everyday                          life here.  Barbados history                           is relatively peaceful, too, in comparison to neighboring                          islands. From 1627 until 1966, the British enjoyed steady                          reign over the island, despite importing the ugliness                          of slavery. Though Barbados history is freckled with attempted                          uprisings, the bloodshed was nothing compared to many                          of the other Caribbean isles.                                     Of all the different locations on Barbados island, the three most popular are the luxurious west coast, the area surrounding the capital city, and the southern coast, where the party ends at dawn.  Usually.                                     Along the west coast you will find secluded Barbados                          villas, some of the most opulent (and, naturally, expensive)                          places to stay in all of the Caribbean. The  Barbados                          beaches  surrounding the unfortunately named Holetown                          are where you go for the definition of luxury vacations                          – Sandy Lane and Tamarind Cove hotels are famed                          for housing British aristocrats on holiday. The Barbados                          villas here are remarkable, a wonderful place for  honeymoons ,                           weddings  and those                          unafraid to splurge while on vacation.                                     The capital city of Bridgetown is another tourist favorite.  Not only do you get instant access to some of the most scenic Barbados beaches (the ever-popular Brighton Beach, for instance), you get to see the rich culture reflected in the city architecture.  Other than the glistening acres of sugarcane that lie in the center of the island, Barbados history is best reflected here – not to mention that most of the nation's population resides around the busy port.  A sense of British sophistication mixed with the elegant Caribbean lifestyle is a wonder to behold.  Not to mention that just south of the city is another enclave of posh Barbados villas, though not nearly as secluded as their cousins to the north.                       But the finest part of Barbados Island lies on the shining southern coast.  Thousands (no, really, thousands) of rum shops (island translation: bars) are found on the island, with the multitude of them located along the Barbados beaches here.  Another island tradition here is the “fish fry,” when villages become party central, and drinks, dancing and heroic amounts of food are laid out for anyone to enjoy.  Calypso, soca and steel drum are alive and well here, and insanely popular.  The price of all this fun is relatively small, too, making this a fantastic destination for the budget traveler.                                                                                                      contact us              |  travel newsletter              |  travel marketing              |  write for us  |               link to us              |  privacy policy               |  terms of use              |  help                           © 2008  Destination360  All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                  Barbados Map                                    Latest Topics     nice place to stay at Bridg...

Parts of the  Greater Bridgetown  area lie along the borders of the neighbouring parishes  Christ Church  and  St. James .   The present day location of the city was established by the  British  in  1628  following their settlement at  James Town . Bridgetown is a major  West Indies  tourist destination, and the city acts as an important financial, informatics and convention centre in the Caribbean region.

Bridgetown's centre was originally composed of a  swamp , which was quickly drained and filled-in to make way for the city's early development.   At the heart of Bridgetown is the Careenage and Constitution River. This body of water provides the city with direct access from medium sized  yachts  or  small craft   boats . Although moderately shallow, the Careenage slices Bridgetown into two parts. During the rainy season the Constitution River flows into the Careenage area and acts as an outflow for water from the islands interior  storm drainage  network. Flowing into the Carlisle Bay on the southwest coast of the island, the Careenage can be observed as a  marina  for boaters entering or exiting the inner basin located directly in front of the Parliament buildings of Barbados.   Barbados has a tropical climate.

It was suspected that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the  Caribbean  known as the  Arawak . Upon finding the structure the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area,  Indian Bridge . It is widely believed that the Arawaks were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of  Saint Lucia , during an invasion by another people indigenous to the region known as the  Caribs . Eventually after  1654  when a new bridge was constructed over the Careenage by the British, the area became known as  The Town of Saint Michael  and later as  Bridgetown , and the final name stuck.   Bridgetown is the only city outside continental North America that  George Washington  visited. (George Washington House, the actual house where he stayed, is now part of the  Garrison Historic Area )     [ edit ]   From a Town into a City   In 1824 Barbados became the seat of the Anglican ' Diocese of Barbados  and the  Leeward Islands '. Due to this the Saint Michael's Parish Church became raised to the status of Cathedral, in so doing the elevation meant that thereafter Bridgetown would be conferred with city status. In December 1925 a committee sought to petition the King for a Royal Charter of Incorporation to devise local government in the city. The plan stated the desire for Bridgetown to be run by a Mayor, 8 Aldermen, 12 Common councillors, a Town Clerk, a Headborough or Chef Constable, and such other officers as would be deemed necessary. It was proposed that the island's  House of Assembly  should seek to Incorporate the city instead of utilising  Royal Charter .          The Coat of Arms of Bridgetown       Some time later in 1842  Royal Letters Patent  under which Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia were split into separate diocese decreed that henceforth the Town of Bridgetown should henceforth be called the City of Bridgetown.   It was not until 1958 when the Local Government Act was passed in Barbados. Within the act called for separate administration for the city. The act called for a Mayor, 6 City aldermen, and 12 City Councillors -- of which 4 serve each of the 3 Wards in the City.   On 20 September 1960 a grant of Arms was conferred upon the City by the  Royal College of Arms  in  London . The Armorial bearings for the City of Bridgetown were designed by the late Neville Connell, the then director of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society along with H.W. Ince the Honorary Secretary of the Society.   Local governemnt in Barbados was established but not for long, the late E.D. Mottley served as the city's first and only Mayor under the Act. In April 1967 the system of Local Government Councils was dissolved and replaced by an Interim Commissioner for Local Government. The Corporation of Bridgetown thus ceased to exist, and its records and paraphernalia were deposited in both the Government Department of Archives and in the Barbados Museum and Historical Society. [ 1 ]  Today Bridgetown and surrounding constituencies are administered by members of Barbadian parliament.     [ edit ]   Amalgamation of the Governor with the Windward Islands   From 1800 until 1885 Bridgetown served as the main seat of Government for the former  British  colonies of the  Windward Islands . During this period the resident  Governor of Barbados  also served as the  Colonial head of the Windward Islands . After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Island union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to  St. George's  on the neighbouring island of  Grenada .   Barbados has been governed by the Barbados Labour Party  (BLP)  for the last thirteen years, commonly called the ""Owen Arthur Administration"". Prime Minister Owen S. Arthur was chosen from among leaders around the globe to deliver the William Wilberforce lecture on the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade.     [ edit ]   Events   Amongst the breathtaking landscapes, and the fresh look of the city; Barbados attracts many investors from various fields. The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup tournament attracted thousands of visitors to the island and was a very prosperous event. The final match was played on Saturday April 28, 2007.

Broad Street passes the Parliament Buildings and serves as the centre of city's shopping area.   Another major traffic artery into the city is Bay Street (which turns into Highway 7) and leads toward the South Coast of Barbados and the Parish of  Christ Church . There are also other notable streets in Bridgetown, including:     Swan Street - which is parallel to Broad Street, to the north.   Roebuck Street - which leads towards Queens Park to the North, and East of Swan Street.     -and-     Tudor Street - which comes from the north, intersects Swan Street and runs perpendicular to Broad Street.   The Spring Garden Highway, which lies to the west of the city, plays host to over 85,000 bystanders and participants in the annual Grand Kadooment Carnival Parade.

The Deep Water Harbour lies a short distance across Carlisle Bay northwest of the Careenage Canal. Found along the Princess Alice Highway, and west of the city's centre around  Fontabelle .   The Harbour port acts as one of the major shipping and  transhipment  hubs from international locations for the entire Eastern Caribbean. Recently the Bridgetown Port was dredged to allow safe access and berthing for the new league of ""super cruise ships"". The dredging project was completed in 2002 and the city can now host many of the largest cruise ships in the world.   The port of  Bridgetown  also handles goods for the domestic needs of the island. The island's main exports of mainly agricultural products also make use of the harbour facilities.   Bridgetown  also has a smaller canal in the centre of the city, named the Careenage, a.k.a. ""Constitution River"". The Constitution River should not be confused with the Deep Water Harbour. The smaller Constitution River feeding into the west coast lies about a half kilometer south of the large harbour. The Careenage is just large enough for pleasure craft or fishing boats and has two main bridges near the city center which span the shallow Careenage.     [ edit ]   Society and culture          Colourful Bridgetown street       Bridgetown serves as a principal centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the island's public transport system. Many of the  ministries and departments  of the island's government are located within the Greater Bridgetown area. The Public Buildings or  parliament , which stand at the heart of the city directly north of Heroes Square, house the third oldest continuous parliament in the  British Commonwealth . Indeed, at one point in the city's early history, Bridgetown was the most important city of all British possessions in the New World due to the city's easterly location in the Caribbean region.   For a city of its size, the Greater Bridgetown area is home to several prestigious educational institutions. The city serves as the seat of one of the three campuses of the  University of the West Indies  in the northern suburb of  Cave Hill . The campus sits on a bluff offering a spectacular view of Bridgetown and its port. The  Barbados Community College  is located three miles east of the Central Business District in a suburb known as ""The Ivy"", while the sprawling campus of the  Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic  is located just beyond the eastern limits of the city in a suburb known as "" The Pine "". In addition, the city houses such distinguished secondary schools as  Harrison College ,  Combermere  and The St.Michael School.   The City of Bridgetown also played host to the 1994 United Nations Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Islands States.  Bridgetown  has branches of some of the largest banks in the world and English-speaking Caribbean and is internationally recognised as an emerging financial domicile. The city is currently experiencing a phenomenal spurt of redevelopment in preparation for the  2007 World Cricket Cup  Finals to be held at the historic  Kensington Oval . The Oval is being renovated to a state-of-the-art sports facility that will accommodate 30,000 spectators. Live viewership for the 2007 event is estimated to be in the region of two billion people.     [ edit ]   Utilities and local services   Today Bridgetown is a fully modern and thriving city, with access to many modern services including a piped water supply (said to be naturally among the purest in the world), electricity, natural gas supply, cutting-edge telecommunications, wireless services, internet cafes, and a good overall infrastructure. The city is also served by an impressive conference facility known as the  Sherbourne Conference Centre .     Electricity -  Barbados Light and Power Company  Ltd.

The  Bajan , or Barbadian dialect is an iconic part of the culture. But English is still the official language, reflecting centuries of British rule.   The island's British influence stretches back to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of  King James I . The first colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and 10  slaves . Early on, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a  Parliamentary democracy  in 1639. During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were white. After slavery was abolished in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first minority member elected in 1843. Although Barbados gained full independence from Britain in 1966, it has retained its governmental style and remains a member of the  Commonwealth of Nations .   In addition to government, the British passed down their love of  cricket . The most popular sport on Barbados, its  cricket team  has won numerous regional matches. Many players on the team go on to success on the  West Indies team  to compete in international games. In fact, one of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir  Garfield Sobers , is a Barbados native.   The country's architecture pays further testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing. In addition to traditional wood and stone, coral was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair.  Jacobean ,  Georgian , and  Victorian  styles dominate. But slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own  chattel houses , so they were an integral part of the island's architectural legacy. Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place. The vivid colors of these chattel houses shows the West African influence.   Religion plays an important role in life on the island. With its long British ties, the  Anglican  church serves the largest segment of the population [ citation needed ] . However,  Roman Catholic ,  Baptist ,  Methodist , and other  Christian  denominations also support congregations. The Christian population celebrates its deeply-rooted faith in an annual festival,  Gospelfest . Smaller  Jewish ,  Hindu , and  Muslim  communities add some religious diversity.   In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals. The  Landship  is a Barbadian tradition. It mimics and parodies the  Royal Navy , and incorporates music, dance and games. The largest and most important festival in Barbados is  Crop Over , which celebrates the end of the  sugarcane  harvest. Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.   The  music of Barbados  is an important part of the country's culture. Modern Barbados has produced popular stars of  calypso  and the indigenous  spouge  style, and also has a large  jazz  scene.  Reggae ,  soca , and  tuk  are popular as well.   Every January, Barbados hosts the  Barbados Jazz Festival . In mid-February, Barbados hosts the  Barbados Holetown Festival  which celebrates the arrival of the first English settlers.     [ edit ]   References     Millington, Janice (1999). ""Barbados"".

The island's vibrant culture and rich history come to life in its lively Bajan festivals, nightlife, and friendly people. Famous luxury resorts are a big draw, but you can also find fun in a local rum bar. And you can't beat the restaurants here, renowed as some of the best in the Caribbean. Barbados Basic Travel Information Location:  Easternmost of the Caribbean islands, in the West Indies north of Venezuela.  Size:  21 mi/34 km long, 14 mi/23 km wide.  Capital:  Bridgetown Language:  English Religions:  Protestant, Roman Catholic  Currency: Barbadian Dollar; U.S. dollar widely accepted. Telephone/Area Code:  246 Tipping : 10-15% Weather:  Dry season January-June; rainy season June-October; trade winds moderate tropical temperatures year-round. Barbados Tourism Authority Barbados Consular Information Sheet CIA Factbook: Barbados Barbados Attractions Cave tours, restored plantation homes, wildlife preserves, gardens and rum or cigar factory tours are just a sampling of Barbados' many and diverse attractions.  Bridgetown is a great city for strolling, and the island's many museums are a testiment to Bajans' proud history and sense of identity. Golf and watersports are popular, as are outback tours by horse, on foot, or on an ATV or 4x4. More Info on Barbados Attractions Barbados Beaches Surfers flock to Barbados' East Coast for big-wave action, while families prefer the calmer waters of the West Coast; beaches here are typically lined with resorts. Many of the South Coast beaches have reefs that invite snorkelers. For solitude, try Bottom Bay near Sam Lord's Castle. All beaches in Barbados are free and open to the public, but there's no nude sunbathing. More Info on Barbados Beaches Barbados Hotels and Resorts Barbados has a reputation as an upscale destination, so it's no surprise to find resorts from brands like Fairmont and Hilton among the big hotels. Sandy Lane is perhaps the most famous: Tiger Woods got married there. But while luxury dominates the west coast, moderately priced hotels, inns and guest houses can be found on the south coast and elsewhere. Barbados also has many luxury villas – luxury private homes that can be rented, even fully staffed. More Info on Barbados Hotels and Resorts Barbados All-Inclusive Resorts Barbados Restaurants Casual by day, island-sophisticated by night, Barbados' restaurant scene is typically mixed. One nice aspect: you can actually find an inexpensive meal, such as stands selling ""roti"" – pastries stuffed with spicy potatoes and meat. Flying fish and cou cou (a mash of corn meal and okra) are the national dishes,  found on the menu of Barbados' many local restaurants; the island also has an abundance of elegant eateries serving cuisine from around the world to Barbados' discriminating visitors. More Info on Barbados Restaurants Barbados Culture and History Barbados was settled by the British in 1627, and endured a slave-driven sugar plantation economy for 200 years. Sugar, molasses and rum are still parts of the economy, but tourism took the lead in the 1990s. Barbados won independence in 1966, although it remains part of the British Commonwealth. A mix of British stoicism and African-flavored joie de vivre typifies today's Barbados: the Bajan dialect you'll hear English spoken with is a perfect example of the mix. More Info on Barbados Culture & History Fun Barbados: Island Culture Barbados.org: History Barbados Events and Festivals The annual sugar-cane harvest was the original Crop-Over; today, Barbados' biggest festival runs three weeks spanning July and August, peaking with the annual Kadooment parade. The yearly Holetown Festival marks the first British settlement with a street fair and parade. Barbudian sophistication is evident at March's Holders Season, which brings in opera, Shakespeare, and other performing arts. The Cricket World Cup will be played here in 2007. More Info on Barbados Events and Festivals Barbados Nightlife Bridgetown is known as one of the nightlife capitals of the Caribbean. You'll find everything from big-city sized discos to open-air dance clubs and bars with local bands banging out reggae, calypso, soca and more. Dinner cruises also are popular, and a lingering dinner at one of the island's great restaurants is always a romantic option. St. Lawrence Gap in Christ Church has staged dinner shows, street parties, and a variety of nightclubs with live music.

Bridgetown was originally named ""Indian                       Bridge"" for the rude bridge which had been constructed                       over the river (now known as the Careenage) by the Indians.                       It was later called the ""town of St. Michael"" in official                       documents, before finally being named Bridgetown.                      The Chamberlain Bridge  was erected in 1872 and was a swing bridge operated by two persons, allowing entry into the inner basin of the Careenage. In 2006 the Chamberlain Bridge was replaced with a modern lift bridge.                     In previous                       times, the careenage was an important hub of                       activity for inter-island trading vessels. Nowadays the                       careenage is mainly utilized by  pleasure                       craft  ( catamarans , yachts,  fishing                       boats , etc).                                           Shopping                      Broad                       Street is the main street of Bridgetown and consists mainly                       of banks, department stores and duty free shops. Other                       streets in Bridgetown such as Swan Street, Roebuck Street                       and Tudor Street consist mainly of smaller shops and businesses,                       together with wayside vendors.

The Barbados Parliament was established                         in 1639 and is the third oldest Parliament in the entire                         Commonwealth.

""Trafalgar Square"" was officially renamed  National                         Heroes Square  in April 1999, in honour of the national                         heroes of Barbados.

The Continental Shelf   Most continents extend far beyond the point where ocean meets land. Their extended perimeter is referred to as the continental shelf. The ocean becomes very deep at the steep slope called the shelf break where the continental shelf ends and the abyssal plain, (or flat ocean floor) begins. Most shelves have a width of approximately 80 km and can measure anywhere between 30 m to 600 m in depth.   The largest shelf, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean, stretches 1,500 km wide. Another large shelf is found in the South China Sea called the Sundra shelf. This shelf joins Borneo, Sumatra, and Java to the Asian mainland. The North Sea and the Persian Gulf also contain shelves. Some geographical areas do not have a continental shelf. This common where the leading edge of moving oceanic plates is found beneath the continental crust. There are no shelves off the coast of Chile or the west coast of Sumatra.   Continental shelves are places of great biodiversity and marine life due to the relative abundance of sunlight available in their shallow waters. In contrast, the abyssal plain has been described as a biotic desert. Shelves eventually become a source of fossil fuels if oxygen poor conditions in sedimentary deposits continue over long periods of time.   The shelf is the most familiar and well-understood area of the ocean floor to humans due to its great diversity of life. Fish species that inhabit continental shelves are quickly becoming over exploited because it's more accessible than deep water species. Continental shelves are also valuable for oil and gas exploration. Consequently, marine nations claimed sovereign rights to their continental shelves in the Convention on the Continental Shelf created by the UN’s International Law Commission in 1958.   The law was partially overridden by the 1982 United States Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.   The Mid-Atlantic Ridge   The Mid-Atlantic ridge runs from Iceland to Antarctic and is the longest underwater mountain range on Earth. The ridge was formed by an oceanic rift separating the North American Plate from the Eurasian Plate in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the South Atlantic, the Mid-Atlantic ridge separates the South American Plate from the African Plate. The Mid-Atlantic ridge sits atop of the highest point of the mid-Atlantic rise, a bulge in the ocean floor where upward convective forces in the asthenosphere push up the oceanic crust and lithosphere. The discovery of the Mid-Atlantic ridge in the 1950’s by Bruce Heezen led to the theory of seafloor spreading and the acceptance of Wegener’s theory of continental drift. The Mid-Atlantic ridge runs along plates that become increasingly more separated according to plate tectonics, a theory developed to explain continental drift.   There is constant movement in the ocean floor due to tectonic plates shifting, submerging deeper, or, as in the case of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, moving away from each other. In the area left behind, new crust is created when magma pushes up from the mantle. The rate of spreading is about 2.5 centimeters per year or 25 km in one million years. Although this rate is relatively slow to humans, in terms of geologic years the plates have moved thousands of kilometers. A good example of seafloor spreading is the Atlantic Ocean, which has transformed from a small inlet between Europe, Africa, and the Americas into the enormous ocean it is today (»  read more ).   Plate Tectonics   The theory of plate tectonics is that plates make up the outer layer of the Earth and have slowly moved long distances throughout the history. This theory explains how the continents once fit together in a single continent called Pangaea. The movement of contintents explains how animals became separated onto different continents, and it explains how mountains, volcanoes, and ocean trenches were formed, and why earthquakes occur. The underlying theory behind plate tectonics is that the force of gravity is stronger on a heavy, cooled ocean floor than it is on a hotter and lighter floor. The boundaries at which plate tectonics occur are: convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, collisional boundaries, and transform boundaries. Crust is formed at divergent boundaries and consumed at convergent boundaries. Crustal plates collide at collisional boundaries and slide against each other at transitional boundaries.   »  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/tryit/tectonics/intro.html   The theory of plate tectonics came about in the 1960s to explain seafloor spreading and continental drift. Around 1915 a scientist named Alfred Wegener published the first edition of ""The Origin of Continents and Oceans"" in which he proposed that the shapes of the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa indicate that may have been attached at some point in history.   In 1962, American geologist Harry Hess suggested that, instead of continents moving through the ocean crust, an entire ocean basin and its connected continent actually moved together as a plate. Once the theory of plate tectonics was accepted, a multitude of questions were explained and a scientific revolution occurred in geophysics and geology.   Other scientific phenomena were explained by plate tectonics as well, such as how the collisions of converging plates had enough force to lift the sea floor into thinner atmospheres.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics   The Science of Plate Tectonics   Tectonic plates are solid bodies of rock floating on top of the asthenosphere, an area that is partially molten. The plates themselves are what make up the lithosphere, which is the Earth’s crust and the solid portion of the upper mantle. The lithosphere is cooler, heavier, and more rigid than the athenosphere and is made up of seven large plates including: the African plate, the Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasianplate, the North American plate, the South American plate, and the Pacific plate.   »  http://scign.jpl.nasa.gov/learn/plate3.htm   Continental crust and oceanic crust behave differently due to their varying composition, so scientists named two types of lithosphere: the continental lithosphere and the oceanic lithosphere. Oceanic lithospheres are denser than continental lithospheres due to the high mafic mineral content in the ocean.   The Details of Plate Boundaries   As mentioned above, plates move in four different ways: convergent, divergent, collisional, and transform boundaries. As these moving plates meet along their boundaries, earthquakes are caused and volcanoes, mountains, and oceanic trenches are formed.   Convergent boundaries  occur where two plates slide towards each other and form a subduction zone, where plates slide underneath each other or an orogenic belt (a.k.a. collisional boundary) where plates simply collide and compress. When a dense oceanic plate collides with a less-dense continental plate, the oceanic plate is usually pushed underneath forming a subduction zone where the ocean floor looks like an oceanic trench on the ocean side and a mountain on the continental side. A subduction zone is found on the western coast of South America where the oceanic Nazca Plate is in the process of subduction beneath the continental South American Plate. The continental spine of South America is dense with volcanoes. These volcanoes are formed by the transfer and heating (by friction) of organic material from the bottom, a process that releases many dissolved gases that can erupt to the surface.   Another example is the Cascade mountain range in North America, which extends north from California’s Sierra Nevada. Volcanoes such as these are known for long periods of quiet and episodic eruptions starting with the expulsion of explosive gas containing fine particles of glassy volcanic ash and spongy cinders. A rebuilding of the pressure with hot magma follows this phase. The Pacific Ocean is completely surrounded by volcanoes; hence it is called The Pacific Ring of Fire. Crumpling of both plates or compression of one plate occurs when two continental plates collide and one overrides the other. For example, the Himalayas were formed when an Indian subcontinental plate was thrust under part of the Eurasian plate. In Japan, it is common to see two oceanic plates converging to form an island arc as one plate is subducted under the other plate.   Divergent boundaries occur where two plates slide apart. The space created here is filled up with crust newly brought up from molten magma below. The East African Great Rift Valley is an example of a rift formed by a divergent boundary. Divergent boundaries most likely form at hotspots where convective cells bring large quantities of molten material from the asthenosphere up and there is enough kinetic energy to break through the lithosphere. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is thought to have come from a hotspot that widens a few centimeters every century. Hotspots may be a future source of energy as they are thought to be an abundant source of hydrogen. Countries like Iceland are actively researching geothermal energy as a source for the world’s first hydrogen economy.   Fracture zones or fault zones in the oceanic ridge system are created by divergent boundaries due to a non-uniform rate of spreading. These fracture zones result in many submarine earthquakes and appear on a map as patterns divided by lines perpendicular to the ridge line. (»  read more ). The patterns are caused by a conveyor belt motion away from the center of divergence.   A major piece of evidence supporting the theory of sea-floor spreading was found at the mid-ocean ridges when airborne geomagnetic surveys revealed an odd pattern of symmetrical polar magnetic reversals on opposite sides of the center of each ridge. These reversals corresponded directly with the Earth’s polar reversals and the theory that the sea floor moves in huge plates was confirmed. Additional evidence was supplied by measuring the ages of rocks in each band. With all the evidence combined it was obvious that huge plates moved away from each other and collided. With the new information it was even possible to create a detailed map of the rate of spreading.   Transform boundaries are formed when plates grind past each other along transform faults. Huge plates grinding past each other cause immense friction and the effects of the stress build-up are highly visible. With transform boundaries, stress builds up in both plates until they reach the slipping point where the built up potential energy is released in the form of a motion along the fault line. In many cases this energy becomes an earthquake. The San Andreas Fault is an example of a transform boundary where the movement of the Pacific and North American plates builds potential energy released in the form of earthquakes.    The Movement of Oceanic Plates   Tectonic plates are able to move because they float on the relatively fluid asthenosphere. The source of energy for the movement of tectonic plates is thought to be the loss or dissipation of heat from the mantle of the Earth. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is converted into two forces, the force of friction and the force of gravity.   The transmission of convection currents in the mantle through the asthenosphere is driven by the force of friction occurring between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere known as mantle drag. Trench suction occurs when local convention currents pull plates at subduction zones and ocean trenches downward with the force of friction.   Gravity is another force in the movement of tectonic plates. There are several different types of plate motion caused by gravity including ridge-push plate motion and slab-pull plate motion. With ridge-push plate motion plates at oceanic ridges are higher in elevation and are prone to sliding down due to the force of gravity. The name is actually not representative of what is actually happening, since there is no pushing going on but rather the sliding down of plates. The underlying cause of motion is upwelling from the convection occurring in the mantle, and this is what triggers the sliding of plates. Slab-pull plate motion is the other gravitational force and is the result of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at places where there is a trench.   Convection   The idea that convection, or the circulation of liquid or gas, occurs within the mantle is supported by strong scientific evidence. Scientists are almost certain that the upwelling of materials particularly around the mid-ocean ridges is caused by convection. It is still not clear what forces move tectonic plates. At first, it was thought that the force of friction between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere was key and that plates sit on top of huge convection cells like conveyor belts. As more data was gathered it became clear that the force of friction was not significant enough to drive the motion of tectonic plates alone. Now it is thought that slab-pull is the strongest force and trench suction follows closely in significance.   The Movement of Plates   Over long periods of time, geologic in scale (approx. every 500 million years), supercontinents form and break up. The oldest-known supercontinent known as Rodinia formed approximately a billion years ago and was the starting material for all the Earth's continents. About 750 million years ago, this supercontinent broke up into eight different continents which then formed two supercontinents called Laurasia (North America, Europe and Siberia/Asia) and Gondwana (China, India, Africa, South America, and Antarctica) about 350 million years ago which then reassembled about 275 million years ago to form what is known as the supercontinent Pangaea. Tectonic forces then began breaking Pangaea apart which continues today. The Earth is not the only planet where plate tectonics can occur. It is thought from observations made in 1999 of the magnetic fields of Mars by the Global Surveyor spacecraft that plate tectonics may have once been at work on Mars.          Hydrothermal Vents   Hydrothermal vents are fractures (cracks) in Earth’s surface where geothermally-heated water pulses through. Usually, a hydrothermal vent is found where hot magma is close to the surface crust as in volcanically active locations. The Earth has quite a few geothermal vents due to its geologically active nature and the vast amount of water present at the surface. Hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers are all examples of geothermal vents on land. Yellowstone National Park in the United States is home to a spectacular display of hydrothermal vents.   Hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor are called submarine hydrothermal vents or black smokers and were discovered in 1977 around the Galapagos Islands by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using a small submersible called Alvin. They are usually hundreds of meters wide and are formed when water heated geothermally to extreme temperatures (up to 400 °C)rises through the ocean floor. The water never boils because of the extreme pressure it is under at that depth. They contain many dissolved minerals like sulfides that usually crystallize into a chimney-shaped structure. The black color comes from the precipitation of minerals when the cold ocean water and the superheated water collide. These black smokers exist in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans usually at about 2,100 meters in depth.   The areas around black smokers contain entire complex communities of bioorganisms who survive using chemicals dissolved in the fluids of the vents. These waters are too deep for sunlight to penetrate, so the vent communities rely on chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis where heat, methane, and sulfur compounds are converted into energy. At the base of the food chain are chemosynthetic organisms that support entire communities of giant tubeworms, clams, and shrimp. Other planets that may have hydrothermal vents are Mars and Europa.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent   Fascinating new species are always being discovered in and around black smokers. The Pompeii worm (Alvinella pompejana) is an animal living exclusively in hydrothermal vents of the Pacific Ocean. This worm was discovered in the early 1980’s by French researchers and is known now to be the “hottest animal on Earth” and an example of an extremophile (or an animal that can live in these extreme environments). In 2001, an  armor-plated gastropod, still un-named, was discovered during an expedition to the Indian Ocean’s Kairei hydrothermal vent field. This animal utilizes pyrite and greigite, iron sulfide compounds, to build it’s hardened body parts instead of the usual calcium carbonate. The armor plating is most likely used to defend the animal from predatory snails with huge teeth in the same area. It is thought that iron sulfide is stabilized by the extreme pressure of 2,500 meters ocean water allowing the compound to be used by bioorganisms.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_worm   The Lost City   In December 2000, a series of hydrothermal vents were discovered during a National Science Foundation expedition to the mid-Atlantic ocean that are very different from the black smoker hydrothermal vents found in the 1970s. A subsequent expedition in 2003 used Alvin to explore these vents and the details of data recovered were published in March 2005. What is being called The Lost City is a series of vents located on the seafloor mountain Atlantis Massif, where hydrogen rich fluids and methane are produced by reactions between seawater and the upper mantle peridotite. The fluid produced here is highly basic (pH 9-11) with temperatures that range from 40° to 90° Celsius. The Lost City consists of about 30 chimneys composed of calcium carbonate and standing 30-60 meters tall in addition to many smaller chimneys.   The vents found at the Lost City release methane and hydrogen into the ocean water and in contrast to black smokers, they do not release a lot of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide or metals. The Lost City is also much older than black smoker vents, an observation made possible using strontium, carbon and oxygen isotopic data and radiocarbon ages to document 30,000 years of hydrothermal activity. Consequently, organisms living in Lost City vents are completely different from those living near black smokers, hence Lost City vents do not contain a lot of chemosynthetic microorganisms found near volcanically driven black smokers. The animals that do live near Lost City vents consist of small invertebrates with carbonate structures like snails, bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods and ostracods. Microorganisms living here include: Methanosarcina-like archaea and bacteria related to the Firmicutes. In addition to the variety of scientifically interesting chemosynthetic organisms supported by black smokers, the Lost City provides scientists with a model of an ecosystem driven by abiotic methane and hydrogen. A large portion of scientific research into whether life exists on other planets, relies on the study of extremophiles here on Earth.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_(hydrothermal_field)   Cold Seeps   A cold seep is a vent that is not superheated but hydrogen sulfide, methane and hydrocarbon-rich fluid still seep out into the surrounding water. The reactions between seawater and methane create carbonate rock formations and reefs over time. Cold seeps do not work in short, unpredictable bursts like many hydrothermal vents but are instead slow and dependable.   Light independent organisms exist in entire communities in and around cold seeps. The organisms that live in cold seeps usually live longer than those at hydrothermal vents due to the relative stability of resources. The longest lived noncolonial invertebrate is a cold seep tubeworm that lives from 170-250 years. Most of the organisms living in cold seeps are reliant on a symbiotic (each benefits from the other) relationship with chemoautotrophic bacteria, organisms that process sulfides and methane through chemosynthesis into chemical energy. The chemoautotrophic bacteria are classified into archaea and eubacteria and power the lives of larger organisms like vesicomyid clams and vestimentiferan tubeworms. In exchange, the clams and tubeworms provide a safe haven for the bacteria and also a source of food. The entire structure and formation of the reefs and rock formations could be dependent on bacterial reactions. The strategy of some bacteria in cold seeps is to create mats, covering the ocean floor. One example is the beggiatoal bacterial mat in Blake Ridge, off the coast of South Carolina.   Dr. Charles Paull is credited with the discovery of cold seeps in 1984 in the Monterey Canyon off of Monterey Bay, California. The first cold seep was discovered at a depth of 3,200 meters, although the deepest cold seep found is located in the Sea of Japan at a depth of 5000-6500 meters. Since then, cold seeps have been found in the Gulf of Mexico, the Sea of Japan, and in water off Alaska’s coast.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep   The Ocean  /  NEXT: Marine Zones » Feedback?  |  [Edit Content]       Sharks & Rays  |  Fishes  |  Squid & Octopuses  |  Reptiles  |  Birds  |  Seals & Sea lions+  |  Whales & Dolphins       Join the MarineBio Society  |   Partners & Sponsors  |  Frontline Marine Conservation  |  Volunteers  |  Help Make a Difference  |  MarineBio Blog  |  For Funders  |  For Scientists  |  For Students  |     The Plankton Forums   Marine Conservation :  A Sea Ethic  |  Marine Conservation Biology  |  Global Warming/Climate Change  |  Sustainable Fisheries  |  Biodiversity  |  Threatened & Endangered Species   Habitat Conservation  |  Alien Species  |  Ocean Dumping Grounds  |  Ocean Resources  |  Sustainable/Eco-Tourism  |  Marine Conservation Organizations   Essays on Wildlife Conservation  |  Marine Conservation Forum  |  The Future   The Ocean/Marine Science :   Marine Life 101  |  Tools & Methods  |  Relevant Journals  |  MarineBio Downloads   Aquariums  |  Creature Quiz  |  MarineBio Kids  |  Fun Ocean Facts  |  Ocean Mysteries  |  Scuba Diving  |  Submarines/Tech  |  Marine Life News  |  MarineBio Resource Directory  |  Books & DVDs+   Education Resources  |  U.S. Colleges  |  International  |  Institutes & Labs  |  Career Resources   About Us  |  What's New?  |  Press  |  MarineBio Projects  |  Expeditions  |  Contributors  |  Contact MarineBio  |  FAQs  |  Site Map           ~ Sharing the wonders of the ocean to inspire  conservation ,  education ,  research , and a  sea ethic  ~  MarineBio.org, Inc. is a US 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.
