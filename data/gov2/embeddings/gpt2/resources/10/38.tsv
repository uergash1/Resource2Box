In severe cases, breathing may be impaired.   Signs and symptoms may include:     Sudden and severe  sore throat   Inflamed  tonsils   Yellow and white patches in the throat   Difficulty swallowing   Tender  cervical   lymphadenopathy   Fever   Headache  (often prior to other symptoms)   General discomfort, feeling ill or uneasy   Halitosis   Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting   Rash [ 2 ]   Hives   Chills   Loss of appetite   Ear pain   Peeling of skin on hands and feet     Additional symptoms such as  sinusitis ,  vaginitis  or  impetigo  be present if the strep bacteria infects both the throat and a secondary location. For additional information on non-pharynx symptoms, see  Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infection .     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   There are several causes for  pharyngitis , not just streptococcus bacteria. Productive coughing, nasal discharge, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat, though a co-infection with a virus is possible and may explain the presence of these additional symptoms. A  Rapid Strep Test  or a throat culture may be undertaken to help clarify diagnosis.   The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in  infectious mononucleosis  (glandular fever). [ 3 ]   A study of 729 patients with pharyngitis, in which 17% had a positive throat culture for group A streptococcus, identified the following four best predictors of streptococcus, also called the  Centor criteria : [ 4 ]     Lack of cough   Swollen and tender anterior  cervical lymph nodes   (Marked) tonsillar  exudates [ 5 ]   Fever             Number of symptoms   Probability of Strep       0   2.5%       1   6.0 - 6.9%       2   14.1  16.6%       3   30.1  34.1%       4   55.7%           Another study on 621 patients, assigned one point for each of the following symptoms: [ 6 ]     Temperature greater than 38 C   Absence of cough   Tender anterior cervical adenopathy   Tonsillar swelling or exudate   Age younger than 15   Subtracting a point for age older than 45.             Points   Probability of Strep   Management       1 or less   0%   Negative: No antibiotic       2   17%   Indeterminate: antibiotic based on throat culture       3   35%       4 or 5   51%   Positive: for throat culture and antibiotics            Finally, patients usually experience swelling of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but swelling can also be located in the soft palate in the top of the mouth. The absence of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates has been suggested as being the most useful finding in ruling out strep throat, with a negative likelihood of 0.74. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission   Strep throat is caused by  Group A streptococcal infection  (GAS), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  specifically the bacterium  Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person via air-based germs. [ 16 ]  In addition, it may be spread through contamination of pillow cases, toys, toothbrushes and other often-used materials. [ 10 ]  Rarely, contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, can result in outbreaks. [ 17 ]   The  incubation period  for strep throat is thought to be between two to five days, but has been reported as long as eight days. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment     [ edit ]   Symptomatic therapies   Nonprescription  over the counter drugs  of  ibuprofen  and  paracetamol  (acetaminophen) both help relieve throat pain and reduce fever by an average of 2.2F or 2.3F in children. [ 19 ]  Aspirin is not recommended for children due to the risk of  Reye's syndrome . In adults aspirin, paracetamol, or ibuprofen help reduce back pain by 48% and sore throat by 31%. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Antibiotics   Antibiotics will reduce symptoms slightly, as was the case in one study of 11 adult patients with sore throat and confirmed GAS infection. They were evaluated daily after the start of antibiotic treatment to register symptoms and signs and to measure body temperature. The mean reduction rate was great, but the greatest reduction was after 3 days. Out of all symptoms, reduction scores for muscle or joint pain was the most at 86%, and the lowest for sore throat at 67%. [ 21 ]  Treatment, which consists of penicillin (orally for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G), will also minimize transmission. This is why  GAS  positive children should not go back to school or day care until they have taken antibiotics for at least 48 hours. In one study the potential risk of transmission to close school contact was assessed by taking 47 children with positive throat cultures and randomly selecting them to receive penicillin V, penicillin G, or erythromycin. Throat cultures were then taken the morning after start of antibiotics and 17 (36.2%) had positive throat cultures. Cultures were taken again 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, and only 12 (17%) of the patients still had positive throat cultures. [ 22 ]   Cephalosporins  (such as cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone) are recommended for penicillin-allergic patients. In another study, 41 patients with confirmed penicillin allergy were evaluated with cefazoline, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxoneall cephalosporinsto see the allergic reaction. Skin tests with cephalosporins were clearly negative in 39 patients and all 41 patients tolerated the three cephalosporins administered. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Second-line antibiotics included amoxicillin, [ 25 ]  clindamycin, [ 26 ]  and oral cephalosporins which have a significantly better cure rate than penicillin. [ 27 ]   Studies have also shown that the broader-spectrum of antibiotics offer more effective short treatment courses than the traditional 10 days of Penicillin V, [ 28 ]  but noted that ""widespread use of broad-spectrum agents for a common infection is a significant concern in an age of increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance"". [ 29 ]  It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever or an abscess on the tonsils. In one report of 500 patients, 30% had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, 0.2% had rheumatic fever and 0.2% had peritonsillar abscess (an abscess on the tonsils). [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Complications   The symptoms of strep throat usually improve even without treatment in five days, but the patient is contagious for several weeks. Lack of treatment or incomplete treatment of strep throat can lead to various complications. Some of them may pose serious health risks. Therefore, streptococcal tonsillitis is important to recognize and treat early. The patient is considered to be contagious up to three days after being treated with antibiotics. [ 30 ]   List of Complications arising from disseminated Streptococcal infection (originating in the throat) [ 31 ]     Scarlet Fever  : a red, raised skin rash caused by  toxins  released by the bacteria   Acute Rheumatic Fever  :  sore joints ,  heart disease ,  involuntary movements  and skin manifestations may occur   Streptococcal Toxic shock syndrome  : septic shock and multi-organ failure   Glomerulonephritis  : a form of  kidney failure  in which antibodies directed against the Streptococcus bacteria become lodged in the kidney, causing damage to the kidney itself   PANDAS Syndrome  : a neurological disorder which can result in permanent injury. Symptoms include  Obsessive-Compulsive  Type disorders and  involuntary movements   Herpes  may be aggravated post-infection     A skin disease known as  necrotizing fasciitis  may occur if Streptococcus bacteria infect a wound on the body, but this is not a complication of strep throat per se.

RSS   Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & History of Abuse - What Do You Think?   Wednesday January 7, 2009          When I saw the first headline about a  new study  linking childhood abuse with  chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS or  ME/CFS ), I knew it was going to open a big ol' can of worms - especially when I saw who was involved in the research and giving a lot of quotes to the media.  I'll explain why shortly.   First, let's talk about the study itself.  The researchers say they found that 60% of the study participants with ME/CFS had been badly abused as children.  They also say that the people with both ME/CFS and a history of abuse had lower salivary  cortisol  (stress hormone) levels than other people with ME/CFS.  (Earlier studies have shown low cortisol is common with this condition.)  They conclude that childhood abuse impairs the body's stress response, and thereby predisposes the abused to developing ME/CFS later in life.   Here's where the can of worms comes in.  The ME/CFS community has fought for decades to shed the idea that their illness is psychological, in whole or in part.  They've been labeled as ""depressed,"" been referred to mental health counseling instead of getting medical treatment, been told they're psychologically ""weak"" because they can't deal with stress, etc.  Many will view this study as a major setback - especially because it's generating headlines like crazy.   As for the researcher who's being widely quoted, he is Dr. William C. Reeves, of the CDC.  He's at the very center of swirling controversy in the ME/CFS community, and it wouldn't surprise me to see his face on the dart boards of a lot of patients, advocates and researchers.  Many leading members of the community say he uses a different definition of the condition, and thereby skews the results to fit a more psychological model.   While previous studies involving Reeves have shown a high abuse correllation with ME/CFS, other studies have contradicted them, including  one study  that even showed a  lower  incidence of abuse.   What's your opinion on this?  Do you think this study is valid?  Partially valid?  Complete hogwash?  Will the coverage of this give people the wrong idea about ME/CFS?  Do you feel that abuse contributed to your illness?  Do you want a photo of Dr. Reeves for your dart board?

Tuesday January 6, 2009   New Drugs of 2009 Series: Ampligen      While millions of people with  chronic fatigue syndrome  (CFS or  ME/CFS ) have waited decades for better treatments, a drug called Ampligen (poly I: poly C12U) has languished in the ""experimental"" stage for 30 years.     Then, in October 2007, Ampligen's manufacturer, Hemispherex Biopharma Inc., put in a  New Drug Application  for Ampligen as the first ever FDA approved treatment for ME/CFS.  In July, the company responded to questions sent back by the FDA, and the application was officially accepted.  Now, it's just a matter of time before we hear yea or nay.  The decision should be out sometime this year.   Ampligen is an immume-system modulator that works by jump-starting your body's natural anti-viral pathway and regulating levels of  Rnase L  (a substance in your cells that attacks viruses), which can be high in people with ME/CFS. Studies show it's more effective and has far fewer side effects than other drugs in its class. Ampligen has also been studied as a possible treatment for certain types of cancer,  AIDS , and  avian flu .     This drug has been available to certain U.S. clinics for several years, and there's a lot of evidence (both clinical and experiential) showing that it works.  Some doctors claim they've seen improvement in 80% of people with ME/CFS who take Ampligen, and significant improvement in about 50%.  A lot of seriously disabled people have even been able to go back to work because of it, they say.  Side effects are reportedly mild, and oddly enough include flu-like symptoms, dizziness and confusion.  (After living with ME/CFS, would you even recognize those as side effects?)  Here's more info from the manufacturer:  Ampligen, from Hemispherex Biopharma    Personally, I think if Ampligen is approved it will be huge for ME/CFS in a couple of ways.  Of course, we desperately need better medications.  But it would also likely mean more public service announcements and lots of publicity, which could lead to better public education and understanding - which we need  almost  as much as we need treatments.   What do you think Ampligen's approval would mean?  Do you want to try it?  I'd love to hear personal experiences from people who've taken it!

However, the deadline for approving or denying  milnacipran  as a  fibromyalgia treatment  came and went in October 2008.  At that time, the FDA said it needed more time to review data but did not give a timeline.  Since then, there's been no word.  Regardless, we should hear early this year about whether milnacipran has passed muster.   Milnacipran is fairly similar to  Cymbalta  (duloxetine), which was the second drug to be FDA approved for fibromyalgia.  Cymbalta is an SNRI (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), which boosts available levels of  serotonin  and  norepinephrine  in the brain.  To date, all FDA-approved drugs in this class raise serotonin more than norepinephrine, but milnacipran favors norepinephrine.   If approved, milnacipran would be making its debut on the U.S. market.  As an antidepressant, it's been used prescribed for more than a decade in 50 different countries.  It's got a good track record for being well tolerated.  When I've written about it here before, I've gotten comments from people involved in the U.S. clinical trials who say they can't wait to get back on this drug.   Are you waiting for word on milnacipran?  Have you talked to your doctor about it?  Have you taken it?

Why?  Two major reasons.  First, you should be familiar with side effects.  My memory is impaired enough that glancing over them once or twice isn't enough - I need a list I can refer back to.  Second, you need to watch out for drug interactions.  Your pharmacist is the best source of information on what doesn't play nicely with what, but you probably can't call at 2 a.m. when you need something to relieve cold symptoms so you can sleep.   There are a few sites you should bookmark so you can check this information quickly whenever you need to:      Drugs A-Z at About.com    Drugs.com    Medline Plus: Drugs & Supplements    RateADrug.com       All of them have information on FDA approved drugs and many supplements.  You'll find side effects lists, possible interactions, pill identifiers (for those loose pills you find in the back of the medicine cabinet) and much more.  I rely on these resources every time I introduce something new, whether it's a prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or supplement.  They've stopped me from making a few mistakes that I could've really regretted.   If you have a negative side effect to a drug, you can report it to the FDA for tracking at  MedWatch .

Diagnosing Fibromyalgia    Before doctors can diagnose  fibromyalgia , they need to rule out a host of other conditions.  Typically, they'll order blood tests to rule out other medical disorders with similar symptoms, including  hypothyroidism,  infections,  polymyalgia rheumatica,   rheumatoid arthritis  or  lupus.      Doctors may also order other lab and imaging tests.  Until recently, no test could definitively diagnose fibromyalgia, but a new  blood test  is is now showing promise in some preliminary studies.  It involves antipolymer antibodies, which may be found in about half of the people with FMS.   Fibromyalgia is typically diagnosed and treated by  rheumatologists .  The  American College of Rheumatology  in 1992 established two criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia:   Pain in all four quadrants of the body and in the axial skeleton (bones of the head, throat, chest and spine) that's been present on a more-or-less continuous basis for at least three months.   Pain in at least 11 of 18 tender points, which are specific spots on the body that hurt when pressure is applied. (See diagram, top right.)    Diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    No medical test can reliably detect  chronic fatigue syndrome .  The first step toward making a diagnosis is for doctors to perform tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms, including chronic infections such as  tuberculosis ,  mononucleosis  or  Lyme ; fibromyalgia; autoimmune diseases such as  multiple sclerosis  and  lupus ; or psychiatric/emotional conditions.   Second, doctors evaluate the patient following guidelines set by the CDC:   Unexplained persistent fatigue that's not due to ongoing exertion, isn't substantially relieved by rest, is of new onset and results in a significant reduction in previous levels of activitiy.  Four or more of the following symptoms are present for six months or more:  Impaired memory or concentration  Post-exertional malaise (extreme, prolonged exhaustion and sickness following physical or mental activity)  Unrefreshing sleep  Muscle pain  Joint pain without swelling or redness  Headaches of a new type or severity  Sore throat that's frequent or recurring  Tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes     These symptoms must have been constant or recurring during at least six months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue.   To date, no medical specialty has ""claimed"" CFS.  It's up to you to  find a doctor  knowledgable about the condition.

Are you down to that final cigarette, but you just can't seem to quit?  If you are pregnant and finding that  quitting smoking  is quite a challenge, this article can help you find a way that works.  Smoking during pregnancy can have a very negative effect on both your health and the health of your baby, and could result in a number of pregnancy complications.  So here are some quitting tips to help you get rid of those cigarettes for good!   Why Quit Smoking During Pregnancy?            It is important to quit  smoking  because of the numerous health risks that the habit can cause.   Health Risks for Mother:  Cigarettes are very dangerous to the health of pregnant mothers because they contain a variety of different drugs and chemicals. Tobacco, which is used in cigarettes and pipes, is a plant product that contains small levels of the drug nicotine.  Nicotine is actually poisonous to humans if it is introduced directly to the bloodstream.  Tobacco is also prepared with over 4,000 different chemicals, which mix together in the body to form a sticky tar that envelops the lungs, skin, and hair.  Many of these chemicals are cancer-causing, and can contribute to serious health problems or even death.   Health Risks for Baby  Cigarettes are also very dangerous for your unborn baby.  Every time you smoke during pregnancy, the chemicals and nicotine that you inhale pass through baby's placenta, blocking him/her from getting any nutrients from your body.  Smoking during pregnancy has also been linked to:     preterm birth   stillbirth   low birthweight babies   breathing issues in childhood (including  asthma )   Choosing Your Quitting Method    In order to quit smoking, it is important to choose a quitting method that is right for you.  During pregnancy, there are a number of stop smoking programs that you can choose from:   Cold Turkey  The cold turkey quit method is one of the most popular ways to quit smoking.  It involves throwing out all of your cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays and trying not to smoke anymore.  The cold turkey method is one of the safest to use during pregnancy: it involves no medications and ensures that cigarette smoke and chemicals stop going into your baby's system immediately.  However, the cold turkey method can mean a lot of withdrawal symptoms, including  depression , stress, and agitation.  Therefore, this method may not be right for you, especially if you were a heavy smoker.  The cold turkey method works for 1 in 20 smokers.   Gradual Quit Method  The gradual quit method allows you to reduce the number of cigarettes that you smoke everyday, until, eventually, you aren't smoking anymore.  Like the cold turkey method, the gradual quit method is safe for pregnant women: it doesn't involve any additional medications and helps to quickly reduce the amount of nicotine and tar inside your body.  However, there may still be affects on the baby since you are still exposing your child to nasty chemicals. Additionally, it is often very difficult to say goodbye to those last lingering cigarettes, so this method may not be effective for you.  Typically, about 1 in 20 people are successful quitters with this method.   Nicotine Replacement  The nicotine replacement method makes use of smoking cessation aids that provide your body with supplies of nicotine.  Commonly used nicotine replacements include the patch (which is worn on your arm), nicotine gum (which you chew), and nicotine nasal sprays (which you spray into your nose).  Researchers aren't exactly sure if these nicotine replacements are safe to use during pregnancy.  However, because they only contain one chemical product (nicotine) they are likely much safer for baby than cigarettes are.  And smokers who use these nicotine replacements are twice as likely to quit successfully; in fact, 1 in 10 smokers quit using nicotine replacements.   Bupropion  Bupropion is an antidepressant that is often sold under the brand name Zyban and Wellbutrin.  Bupropion appears to help smokers quit their habits quite successfully; in fact, 1 in 10 smokers that use bupropion quit.  The drug hasn't been appropriately studied during pregnancy and, in large doses, the drug has been known to cause seizures.  However, if you are not at risk for seizures, your health care provider may recommend bupropion as an aid for quitting.   Counseling  Individual and group counseling sessions are available from highly trained social workers and psychologists.  These people can teach you how to quit your smoking habit by altering some of your negative thought and behavior patterns.  Some counselors also use hypnosis to help smokers quit.   Staying Strong    Quitting smoking during pregnancy is a particularly hard thing to do.  However, you can use the health of your baby as motivation to help you quit.  If you find yourself slipping back into the habit, remember:     Replace Old Habits:   If you are finding it impossible not to smoke when you see your favorite coffee shop or bus stop, try to find something else to do.  Suck on a hard candy, take up knitting, or find a new place to hang out.  Avoid triggers that set off those nicotine cravings.  And when you feel a craving coming on, try to wait it out for five minutes.  This is enough time to allow the craving to subside.   You Can't Do It Alone:   Smoking is a very challenging thing to overcome, especially when combined with all of those pregnancy symptoms and discomforts.   Don't rely on your willpower alone to get you through.  Instead, enlist the support of a friend or family member while you are quitting - they can help you through the tough times while you are trying to stop smoking.   It's Never Too Late:   Though health care providers recommend that women quit smoking before getting pregnant, many experts feel that it is unlikely that smoking will cause any damage to your child before 14 weeks.  However, even if you haven't quit by this point in your pregnancy, it is never too late.  Continue working on cutting back on your cigarette use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              About Us  |                Terms of Use and Disclaimer  |                Privacy Policy  |                Contact Us   |                Forum    |                A - Z of Pregnancy Terms  |                Advertise With Us   |                Resources  |                Suggest a Resource                                                                     American Baby Magazine  |                Baby Talk Magazine  |                Guess Your Due Date  |       Submit an Article                                       Copyright © 2001 - 2009 Pregnancy-Info.net.

Heart Attack:     Description: Occurs when the areas of the heart muscle is deprived of blood flow and oxygen for a prolonged period , usually within 20 to 30 minute, and the muscle begin to die.    Causes of Heart Attack:     Usually the result of severe narrowing or a complete block of a diseased coronary artery or plaque rupture or erosion with secondary thrombus formation. Rare causes include Embolism, dissection of the coronary artery, block blood flow to heart muscles causing a heart attack.    Symptoms/Signs of a heartattack     Chest discomfort is the most important signal of a heart attack. Discomfort can occur in other areas of upper body.     Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the neck, vomiting, back, jaws and stomach. Other signs may include sweating, nausea, lightheadedness or shortness of breath.    Be alert to the fact that in a long term follow-up of the Framingham study one third of first infarctions in men and half of those in women were clinically unrecognized. About one half of them are truly silent, but other 50% has a typical presentations.    1. The discomfort may not be severe and the patient may complain only of related symptoms, such as shortness of breath.  2. The person does not necessarily have to ""look bad""  and have all the symptoms of a heart attack to be present.  3. Stabbing , momentary twinges of pain are usually not a signals of heart attack.  4. If the patient uses the word sharp to describe the pain, ask him or her to use another word to clarify the meaning.    The Manor Controllable Risk factors of heart attack and Stroke:      Cigarette Smoking:  Cigarette smoking is the most important single cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking damages blood vessels and causes numerous other preventable diseases. Stop smoking as soon as possible. Seek help from your physician. Pick a day now to quit. It is the greatest gift you can give to your self and your dear one.    High blood pressure:   uncontrolled high blood pressure is associated with a greatest risk of heart attack and is the single most important risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can damage your blood vessels and even lead to a rupture of blood vessel in the brain. Have your blood pressure checked regularly and seek treatment if high blood pressure is noted.    High blood cholesterol:  when the excess cholesterol is deposited in the inner walls of the arteries, it can cause the arteries to narrow and obstruct blood flow to the heart or brain. Avoid a diet high in saturated fat.    Physical inactive:  a sedentary life style can lead to heart attack, but vigorous exercise by persons who have not exercised regularly can be dangerous. Consult a physician before starting an exercise.     http://www.seoserviceworld.com              By  kishan ghataliya Published: 11/2/2007             Discuss     Email Article                Use the feedback form below to submit your comments.

All rights reserved.             Fibromyalgia Facts    Fibromyalgia's defining characteristic is widespread pain that can be in any part of the body and can move to different areas.  Researchers are coming to believe that fibromyalgia may be neurologically based, and that pain is the result of the brain amplifying signals from the nerves.   The pain of fibromyalgia can be dull, stabbing, throbbing or burning. It can be constant or can come and go, and the intensity can vary as well.     Other  fibromyalgia symptoms  include fatigue, mental fog (called fibrofog),  anxiety , morning stiffness,  sleep disorders  and many more. The condition has about 60 recognized symptoms, which can vary from person to person both in number and in severity.   Things like injury, illness, stress (emotional or physical) and fatigue can make symptoms worse. Some people have specific triggers (things that increase symptoms), such as foods, chemicals or the menstrual cycle.   People with fibromyalgia also frequently have other coexisting conditions, including  chronic fatigue syndrome ,  irritable bowel syndrome ,  myofascial pain syndrome ,  rheumatoid arthritis  and  multiple sclerosis .   While fibromyalgia has only been clearly defined for a short time, people have reported the same ""mysterious"" clusters of symptoms throughout history.   People from every culture and socioeconomic level have fibromyalgia. It's most common in women over 30, but men and children can come down with it as well.   More than 6 million people in the U.S. have fibromyalgia. Many of them are too disabled to continue working.   The Social Security Administration does recognize fibromyalgia as a potentially disabling condition. However, having a  disability claim  approved is a long and difficult process that can be complicated by the ambiguous nature of fibromyalgia symptoms and the lack of diagnostic tests.   Diagnosing Fibromyalgia    So far, no test can accurately diagnose fibromyalgia. Doctors do need to rule out numerous conditions with similar symptoms before diagnosing fibromyalgia.   Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia was established in 1990 by the American College of Rheumatology. It requires widespread pain for 3 months or more and pain in at least 11 of 18 specific spots on the body, called  tender points .   Treating Fibromyalgia    The FDA has approved 2 drugs for fibromyalgia -  Lyrica (pregabalin)  and  Cymbalta (duloxetine)  - but doctors prescribe many  drugs to treat fibromyalgia . Unfortunately, common pain killers, such as anti-inflammatories ( Motrin ,  Aleve ) and narcotics ( Vicodin ,  Percocet ) are generally ineffective against the pain of fibromyalgia.   People with fibromyalgia frequently have a hard time  finding a doctor  knowledgable about fibromyalgia and how best to treat it.   Historically, fibromyalgia has most often been treated by rheumatologists. In recent years, however, neurologists, physiatrists and naturopaths have begun treating it more. People with fibromyalgia also sometimes see massage therapists, chiropractors, physical therapists and other complementary and alternative-medicine practitioners. They may also see a psychiatrist or psychologist to deal with the difficulties of a debilitating condition and possibly for depression.   Depression  is common in people with fibromyalgia, as it is in debilitating pain conditions overall. Fibromyalgia, however, is not a psychiatric condition.   Fibromyalgia sometimes gets worse over time, but sometimes stays about the same or improves.   What Causes Fibromyalgia?    We don't yet know what causes fibromyalgia. Many people develop it after being injured, while in others it may be triggered by chronic stress or as a secondary condition (in those with pre-existing chronic pain conditions.)   Fibromyalgia is officially classified as a syndrome, which means it's a collection of signs and symptoms that are known to occur together, but without a known pathology.   Fibromyalgia tends to run in families, leading researchers to believe that it has a  genetic component .   Sources:   2004 Devin J. Starlanyl.  All rights reserved.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5 :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of Santa J. Ono have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.

These are the most common form of  soft tissue  tumor. [ 1 ]  Lipomas are soft to the touch, usually moveable, and are generally painless. Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children. Some sources say that malignant transformation can occur, [ 2 ]  while others claim that this has yet to be convincingly documented. [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Types   2   Prevalence   3   Causes   4   Treatment   5   Prognosis   6   In veterinary medicine   7   Other conditions involving lipoma   8   References   9   External links     9.1   General information   9.2   Images                   [ edit ]   Types          Lipoma removed from human torso       There are several subtypes of lipoma [ 4 ] :624-5  :     Angiolipoma   Angiolipoleiomyoma   Neural fibrolipoma   Chondroid lipoma   Spindle-cell lipoma   Pleomorphic lipoma   Intradermal spindle cell lipoma   Hibernoma     The most common type is the ""superficial subcutaneous lipoma"", i.e. just below the surface of the skin. [ 3 ]  Most occur on the  trunk ,  thighs  and the  forearms , although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.   Lipoma of the  corpus callosum  is a rare congenital condition which may or may not present with symptoms. [ 5 ]  Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1-3 centimeters, [ 6 ]  but in rare cases they can grow over several years into ""giant lipomas"" that are 10-20 cm across and weigh up to 4-5 kilograms. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Prevalence   Approximately one percent of the general population has a lipoma. [ 3 ]  These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. [ 9 ]  Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease  Bannayan-Zonana syndrome . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Causes   The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary although hereditary conditions, such as  familial multiple lipomatosis , may include lipoma development. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Genetic studies in mice from the laboratory of  Santa J. Ono  have shown a correlation between the  HMG I-C  gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between  HMG I-C  and mesenchymal tumors. [ 14 ]   Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called ""post-traumatic lipomas."" [ 15 ]  However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Treatment   Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for  histopathology  to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a  liposarcoma . [ 3 ]   Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. [ 9 ]  This cures the majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision. [ 17 ]   Liposuction  is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small  connective tissue  component. Liposuction typically results in less  scarring ; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to re-growth. [ 18 ]   There are new methods being developed that are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One of them is removal by the use of injection of compounds that trigger  lipolysis , such as  steroids  or  phosphatidylcholine . [ 9 ] [ 19 ]  Another method being developed is the use of  ultrasound  waves to destroy the lipoma. [ citation needed ]  This can be compared with the removal of  kidney stones  where ultrasound is used to pulverize the stones.     [ edit ]   Prognosis   Lipomas are rarely life-threatening and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous, for example lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding,  ulceration  and painful obstructions. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Malignant transformation of lipomas into  liposarcomas  is very rare and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions, [ 17 ]  although a few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . It is possible these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle  malignant  characteristics were missed when the tumour was first examined. [ 24 ]  Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas, because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   In veterinary medicine   Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. [ 27 ]  Obese female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. [ 27 ]  Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, but rarely in cats and pigs. [ 30 ] [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Other conditions involving lipoma   Lipomatosis  is a hereditary condition where multiple lipomas present on the body.   Adiposis dolorosa  (Dercum disease), is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. It is generally seen in obese, postmenopausal women. [ 31 ]   Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, although non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.
