Meet the Fire Chief    Board of Directors    Budget    Department History    Organizational Chart    What is a Special District?            Department Stats    Enduring Goals    Agendas/Minutes                             ""Independent, special purpose governmental units (other than school       districts) that exist as separate entities with substantial administrative       and fiscal independence from general-purpose governments"" (U.S.       Census Bureau, 1994, p.23).         ""Legally constituted governmental entities…that are neither       cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, or schools"" (Office of the       California State Controller, 1994, p.2).         What does a special district do?        Special districts fulfill a needed function, as determined by a local       constituency. For example, the League of Women Voters identified the       following types of special districts: Airport districts, hospital       districts, levee districts, community service districts, municipal utility       districts, public utility districts, recreation and park districts,       utility districts, sanitary districts, water districts, resource       conservation districts, water storage districts.         Additionally, special districts are formed to provide the following       services: mosquito abatement, library services, road maintenance, drainage       functions, and fire services (emergency mitigation).         Are all special districts the same?        1. Dependent district- The district is governed by a city council or       county board of supervisors, directly or indirectly.        Joint Powers Authority or Joint Powers Agreement (JPA).        2. Independent district-The district is governed by an elected board.       Created by residents who see an unfilled need or service.        Independent special districts can determine its own budget, levy        taxes, collect charges, and issue debt.        3. Enterprise districts- These districts are able to charge fees for some       or all of their services, i.e.  garbage sewer, water.        4. Nonenterprise districts- Generally do not charge for their services,       i.e. fire protection, libraries.        5. Combination districts-The preponderance of the fees charged does not       make a significant portion of the district's revenues.        6. Single purpose district-The district provides a single service or       function, i.e. street lighting.        7. Multipurpose district-The district provides at least two services, i.e.       fire districts provide fire suppression, EMS, hazardous materials       mitigation, technical rescue, fire prevention services, and arson       investigation.         How did special districts get their start?        Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom in 1500 (Smith, 1974).        George Washington's secretary of the Treasury used ""mixed       corporations"" to finance banks, canals, turnpikes, and bridges.        During the 19th century American employed special transportation districts       for toll roads and canals.        In California the first two irrigation districts were formed in 1887 under       the Wright Act.        The Depression caused a dramatic increase in special districts so the       States could evade debt limitations, thus allowing them to participate in       national public works projects.        During WWII a scarcity of materials slowed special district growth, but       postwar development pressures stimulated the expansion of special       districts.         What are the principal types of special districts?        Fire protection - 18.1%        Housing and community development - 12.0%        Water - 11.4%        (1994)         How many special districts are there in California, compared to       other forms of government?        58 counties        470 cities        380 redevelopment agencies        1,100 school districts        4800 special districts        (1992)         What laws govern special districts?        All federal and state laws apply.        Additionally, the following laws are particularly important to special       districts.        Cortese-Knox Act        Brown Act        Bergeson Fire District law         What controversies surround the discussion of special districts?        Government accountability        Run away taxation        Uncoordinated government service delivery        Consolidation/merger/annexation        Hidden government        Responsiveness         How can I learn more about special districts?

With its proactive systems evaluation approach, CQI       at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District has changed the way quality of       service is assessed and improved. CQI recognizes that the majority of       problems result from a failure in the process of providing the service, as       opposed to being attributable to the providers themselves.         The American River College EMS Training Program and the Peer Review       Committee are the driving forces behind the Continuous Quality Improvement       Process at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. The Peer Review Committee reviews       all PCRs (Patient Care Reports) produced by district personnel and       identifies individual, agency, and system trends. The committee then works       as a team in helping to reduce or eliminate any actions or items that do       meet district standards.         Rather than focusing on individual problems or working in a crisis       management mode, CQI focuses on providing quality service that meets the       customer's needs by emphasizing Prospective Training and identifying       System Issues. The review and work in the CQI process involves       Prospective, Immediate, and Retrospective supervision and review.         The essence of the CQI Process at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire       District is proactive training, immediate and proactive feedback, and       non-punitive respective review of medical care delivered by District       Personnel leading to constant review and improvement of EMS Policies and       Procedures. This process is successful only through the cooperation of       management and line personnel (Team Effort) working to improve the system."
