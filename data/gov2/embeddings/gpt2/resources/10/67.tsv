Twenty Useful Tips To Help You Quit Smoking       1. Taking 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda 3 times a day will help you quit smoking.

Eating lots of salads and other fruits will also help. Avoid meat and alcohol.   3.

By Judy Brown   I often hear people say that they have smoked for so long that they can?t see what good it would do to quit now. So what is the big deal if you quit smoking? Will it do you any good or is it a pointless exercise in futility?   My answer always is that the benefits of quitting smoking are enormous. Here are some powerful reasons for quitting: The excess risk of developing heart disease as a result of smoking may be reduced by as much as half in the year or two after quitting. After 15 years, the former smoker's risk of heart disease approaches that of a person who has never smoked. Five to 15 years after quitting the risk of stroke returns to the level of those who have never smoked.>>> Read Full Article    ..........................................................................................................

Smoking is the number ONE preventable cause of premature death and morbidity in America. There is nothing more dangerous you can be doing to your health. And it isn?t just bad for you, smoking around your kids can cause severe health complications down the road and cause serious damage while their lungs and other vital organs are developing. All of this information is well documented by the AMA, American Lung and Heart Associations, and the American Cancer Society. >>> Read Full Article   ..........................................................................................................       What a Single Cigarette Can Do to Your Health      An average of 400,000 Americans die each year from frequently smoking cigarettes. This vast number implies that in every five deaths that occur in America one is caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking has also set a new mortality trend on modern day American society. It is roughly estimated that within 1960 and 1990, lung cancer deaths brought about by frequent cigarette smoking among women have exceeded breast cancer deaths by an astounding 400% during the mid-80's.     With these disturbing figures, you might find it alarming how a simple cigarette stick could inflict such damage over a huge number of the American population. Most smokers may be aware of the major risks and complications attributed to frequent cigarette smoking. What they lack, however, is knowledge that a simple cigarette practically inflicts varying degrees of damage on each vital part of the human body.    Lung cancer, emphysema, and bronchitis - these are the typical chronic diseases that are equated to smoking cigarettes. However, having knowledge about these three chronic diseases brought about by cigarette smoking is like scratching the mere surface of a looming greater damage that cigarette smoking is capable of. One major recipient of the fatal blow of cigarette smoking is the heart. The implications of cigarette smoking on the human cardiovascular system are quite vast: it lessens the HDL cholesterol, or which is commonly called as the ""good"" cholesterol, which is responsible for keeping a balance well-being of the heart. Frequent cigarette smoking also diminishes the elastic capabilities of the largest blood vessel in the body, the aorta, which increases the chances of fostering blood clots. Plus, have you ever heard anyone say that they smoke to release stress? This is usually the answer of most smokers; however, contrary to being a means of alleviating stress, smoking does the complete opposite.  Taking a single puff from a stick of cigarette dramatically increases the sympathetic nervous system's activity which in effect, creates more stress on the regulating system of the heart and blood vessels. Women smokers, on the other hand, face a much riskier condition because cigarette smoking diminishes the production of estrogen, which then increases the probability of having some form of cardiovascular ailments.    Other than the apparent negative effects of cigarette smoking to the lungs and the cardiovascular system, your bones and joints also face the same damage from constant smoking. Frequent cigarette smoking hampers the formation of new bones. But the most disturbing part of this is that women are most prone to this kind of damage. Women smokers involve themselves with a very high risk of developing osteoporosis and they are also vulnerable to fostering a case of rheumatoid arthritis. In general, however, both men and women smokers are susceptible to various degenerative disorders that can also lead to damages to the spine. Aside from bone and joint damages, constant cigarette smoking is also capable of causing peptic ulcers by reducing the production of prostaglandin and bicarbonate which in turn dramatically increases the acid secretion of the body. The mere act of holding a stick of cigarette in your mouth already poses dangers that may lead to mouth infections, bad breath, and tooth decay. Simply put, smoking cigarettes at a frequent period, radically affects your over-all well-being. Now, the best move or path that one must take is that path towards a cigarette smoking-free life.     To make your journey towards this path a lot easier, be sure that you employ the help of the  Cig-Arette System .  Being an active cigarette smoker for a very long period of time, the mere thought of quitting is capable enough to make you cringe. It is very true that quitting such nasty habit is one tough task; however, with the aid of the  Cig-Arette System , which involves undergoing a seven-day program, kicking off this vice can be quite easy. Unlike the common methods or cigarette substitute such as nicotine gums and nicotine patches,  Cig-Arette System  is compromised of organic and natural components only, that are proven to help you curb down on your cigarette dependence. In this way, you are completely free from any form or dose of nicotine that most of these conventional substitutes contain.  All it takes are 7-days of pure devotion to the program, and you will find yourself more rejuvenated and free from the nasty effects that cigarette smoking can bring.    Cigarette smoking is probably one of the most pointless activities that man ever came up with. You gain nothing from it except a swarm of harmful diseases that can eventually lead to death. Basically, the act of smoking gains you nothing but takes everything from you. Whatever your reasons are for opting to smoke cigarettes, it doesn't change the fact that you're pulling yourself into a downward spiral of death that is completely meaningless and futile.  Thus, through the act of unfastening the firm hold of cigarette smoking on your body, you profess that you value life and the other lives that coincide with yours.                After 3 hours, I really did Quit!

If you have made the decision to quit smoking, congratulations! Not only will you improve your own health, you will also protect the health of your loved ones by no longer exposing them to secondhand smoke.               We know how hard it can be to quit smoking. Did you know that many people try to quit two or three times before they give up smoking for good? Nicotine is a very addictive drug—as addictive as heroin and cocaine. The good news is that millions of people have given up smoking for good. It's hard work to quit, but you can do it! Freeing yourself of an expensive habit that is dangerous to your health and the health of others will make you feel great!               Many women who smoke worry that they will gain weight if they quit. In fact, nearly 80 percent of people who quit smoking do gain weight, but the average weight gain is just five pounds. Keep in mind, however, that 56 percent of people who continue to smoke will gain weight too. The bottom line: The health benefits of quitting far exceed any risks from the weight gain that may follow quitting.                            How to Quit               Research has shown that these five steps will help you to quit for good:                               Pick a date to stop smoking.  Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home. Write down why you want to quit and keep this list as a reminder.                 Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers.  Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out.  Get more support ideas .                  Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine.  When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.                 Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.  Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking. These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly. There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms. Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:                                      nicotine patch : worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin                      nicotine gum or lozenge : releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth                      nicotine nasal spray : inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream                      nicotine inhaler : inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat                      bupropion : an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke                      varenicline (Chantix™) : a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking                                                   Be prepared for relapse.  Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting. Don't get discouraged if you relapse. Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good. Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit. Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success. Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking. These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed. Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.                              Where to Get Help               Get more help if you need it.

First and foremost, set a quit date and quit COMPLETELY on that day. To prepare for that day: Identify the times you are most likely to smoke. For example, do you tend to smoke when feeling stressed? When you are out at night with friends? While you are drinking coffee or alcohol? When you are bored? While you are driving? Keep a diary to help you determine such risky times. Record each time you have a cigarette, including time of day and what you are doing. Make a plan about what you will do instead of smoking at those times when you are most likely to smoke. For example, drink tea instead of coffee -- tea may not trigger the desire for a cigarette. Or, take a walk when feeling stressed. Remove ashtrays and cigarettes from the car. Place pretzels or hard candies there instead. Pretend-smoke with a straw. Let all of your friends, family, and co-workers know of your plan to stop smoking and your quit date. Just being aware that they know can be a helpful reminder and motivator. Before your quit date, start reducing your cigarette use, including decreasing the number and strength of the cigarettes. However, DON'T do this simply to make your diary ""look good!"" Get rid of all of your cigarettes just before the quit date and clean out anything that smells like smoke, such as clothes and furniture. Other tips to help you quit smoking and stick to it: Enroll in a smoking cessation program (hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites often offer programs). Ask your health care provider for advice, including whether prescription medications (such as bupropion -- Zyban or Wellbutrin, or varenicline -- Chantix) are safe and appropriate for you. Find out about nicotine patches, gum, and sprays. Try hypnosis -- it works for some people. Avoid smoke-filled settings and situations in which you are more likely to smoke. Exercise to relieve urges to smoke. The American Cancer Society  is an excellent resource for smokers who are trying to quit, and the Great American Smokeout can help some smokers kick the habit. Above all, don't get discouraged if you aren't able to quit smoking the first time. Nicotine addiction is a hard habit to break. Try something different next time.

Although responsible for around  440,000 deaths each year , cigarettes and tobacco related products can be purchased at almost every corner store, supermarket, or liquor store in the country.      Because of the variety of  health problems  that are linked to smoking, the majority of those people would love to be able to quit [1] . But as with any addictive habit, this is often  easier said than done . People who quit smoking often experience severe  withdrawal symptoms  (both physical and mental) - making it hard for them to stick with their goal of quitting completely. [2]     But quitting smoking is  not  impossible.  Thousands of people successfully quit smoking each year . The following information is designed to help guide you through some of the most effective ways to quit smoking and to provide you with links to some of the best online resources for those that truly want to become smoke free.      Things to Keep in Mind        Try and pick a good time to quit . Don't try to quit during the holidays, during finals week, right before a big presentation, or any other time where stress levels are heightened. This will decrease your chances of success and give you an excuse to start smoking again.   You may gain a small amount of weight when quitting smoking. This is normal.  Most people gain between 5 to 10 pounds after quitting  due to the decreased metabolism that quitting nicotine can cause. [3]  Weight gains of more than 10 pounds are usually caused by people substituting food for cigarettes in their diet.  Be prepared to try quitting more than once . Most people are not fully successful the first time they try and need to attempt it a couple of times before they finally quit for good. Don't get discouraged if you aren't successful at first. Like anything worth doing, it may take you a few tries to get it right.      Step 1: Prepare to Quit      Quit Day!   Set a quit date . Decide on a day within the next two weeks in which you will stop smoking entirely. You may want to pick a day that has added significance, such as your birthday, wedding anniversary, or the first day of the New Year. If you smoke at work, you may want to consider quitting on the weekend, a vacation, or on a day off.  Remove all tobacco products , ashtrays, lighters and matches from your home, car and office. Having even one pack of cigarettes at your home will make it that much easier to start smoking again.   Notify friends and family  that you plan on quitting. Warn them that you may be irritable or have mood swings for a week or two. Ask them to be patient and supportive during the process. If someone close to you smokes, ask that they refrain from smoking around you (or even better - suggest that they try quitting with you).   Talk to your doctor  about your decision to quit smoking. [4]  Find out if this may have any affects on the medications you are currently taking. You may also want to inquire about medications that may help you overcome the withdrawal symptoms of quitting smoking.      Step 2: Find Medications to Help You Quit Smoking   ( Note:  All of the medications described in this section have been  FDA approved  for smoking cessation) [5]     Varenicline:  Marketed under the brand name  Chantix ,  Varenicline  is a prescription-only medication that helps smokers by blocking the rewarding effects of nicotine, while also helping people deal with the withdrawal symptoms of quitting. For more information, see the  Official Site .  Bupropion SR:  Also known as  Zyban  or  Wellbutrin ,  Bupropion  is a medication that is designed to help reduce nicotine cravings and may also relieve symptoms of depression that some people may feel when quitting. Burpropion is not recommended for those with a history of eating disorders or seizures.      Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT)      Nicotine Patch   Patch:  A nicotine patch is a  Transdermal Patch  which releases a steady stream of nicotine into your bloodstream through your skin. Patches are usually used for a designated period of time (16-24 hours) and are available in differing strengths (depending on how many cigarettes you smoked). One of the benefits of the patch is that it provides a constant stream of nicotine to the system so that nicotine levels in your system stay consistent throughout the day.       Amazon:  Nicotine Patches   (Partner)          Nicotine Gum   Gum:   Nicotine gum  is a replacement therapy that allows nicotine to be delivered to the bloodstream by being absorbed by the tissues in your mouth. Users of nicotine gum may chew anywhere from 10 to 30 pieces a day, or may just have one anytime they feel a craving to smoke. Just like the patch, nicotine gum is available in different strengths. Nicotine gum often works well for people who have an oral fixation, or a psychological dependence on the physical act of smoking.        Amazon:  Nicotine Gum   (Partner)       Nicotrol Nicotine Inhaler   Inhaler:  A  Nicotine inhaler  allows the user to take small puffs of nicotine (as needed) from a small inhaler, without the harmful Carbon Monoxide found in cigarette smoke. Good for administering small doses of nicotine when cravings arrive. Also, inhalers also help by mimicking the act of raising a cigarette to your lips.       Commit Nicotine Lozenge   Lozenge:   Nicotine lozenges  come in the form of a hard candy which slowly dissolves in your mouth while releasing nicotine into your bloodstream. As with nicotine gum, lozenges deliver nicotine to the brain quicker than the patch, making it easier to respond to specific and powerful nicotine cravings.      Amazon:  Nicotine Lozenges   (Partner)         Step 3: Surviving Your First Week   Because  most people who start smoking again do so relatively soon after quitting , the first week is crucial to your success. Unfortunately, due to the effects of nicotine withdrawal - and the fact that they haven't yet become accustomed to life without cigarettes - this is also the most difficult period for most people. But, for those that survive the first week without smoking, staying smoke free will get that much easier. Here are a few tips to help you get through the first week:      Cigarette Substitutes      Lollipops   Because your mind and body have become accustomed to the physical act of smoking (holding the cigarette in your hand - putting it to your lips - taking a puff), it is often helpful to have a number of  items to substitute in their place . Whenever you feel a craving come on, use one of these items to help with the physical cravings of wanting a cigarette:    Toothpicks  Lollipops   Carrot  or  Celery  sticks  Sunflower seeds   Chewing Gum   Mints   Coffee Stirrers      Behavioral Changes   When looking back at your past as a smoker, you will begin to notice certain  behaviors and activities  that were directly linked - in one way or another - to smoking.     Coffee and Cigarettes Take a minute to think about the things in your life that usually involved smoking a cigarette - either before, after or during. Try to recognize some of the activities that you most commonly associate with smoking cigarettes and see if you can cut back, or eliminate them completely, from your daily routine. Some of these may be harder than others to eliminate, but identifying behaviors that lead to cravings can be a great way to help you predict when you may have a craving so that you can be prepared to deal with it. Here are some of the most common behaviors that people often associate with smoking:          Drinking  alcohol  or  coffee   On work breaks or between classes  During stressful situations  First thing in the morning  While driving  After meals      Dietary Changes      Drink 8 glasses of water a day   Because quitting smoking (and the effects of  nicotine withdrawal ) can wreak havoc on your body chemistry as your body begins to adjust to the decreased levels of nicotine, it is important to tailor your diet so that you provide yourself with the nutrients your body needs to help you feel good during this difficult time. [6]  Here are a few things you can do to help your body adjust:    Drink at least  8 glasses of water each day . This will help flush out the toxins in your body and will keep you hydrated and feeling refreshed.  Instead of  coffee  for breakfast, substitute  juice ,  milk  or  tea .  Caffeine  is a powerful drug and can affect your body's chemistry, as well as your mood.  Eat balanced, well-rounded meals. Avoid fast food, junk food, or any other type of food that could severely increase your  sugar  or  salt  intake.      Exercise   Besides being great for your body, your health, and your general well-being, exercise can also be a great diversion from smoking. You don't need to rush out and join a gym and starting working out 5 hours a day. Small, short bursts of exercise can help you overcome those sudden cravings that come out of nowhere.     Riding a bike  Besides helping with cravings, exercise can also do wonders to improve your overall mood and outlook. Here are a few types of exercise you can do when cravings arise:  1.

A nice, healthy meal Reward yourself  for not smoking by doing something special for yourself. With all of the money you are saving by not buying cigarettes, you should be able to afford to do something fun. Here are a few suggestions:    Take yourself out for a nice meal  Buy yourself some new clothes  Go see a movie  Go see a concert  Buy some new  music       Step 4: Staying Quit   Just because you've gotten through the first week without having a cigarette doesn't mean you're out of the clear yet. In order to eliminate the nicotine that was in your body, your  body produced a higher amount of certain chemicals and hormones . [7]  Even though the nicotine has left your system, your body hasn't quite gotten the message yet and is still producing those chemicals - which can cause continued cravings. That is why it is extremely important that you stay vigilant and continue with the methods that have gotten you this far. Here are a few tips on getting through this second stage and on fighting the continuing battle to stay smoke free:       No Smoking!   Make a list  of all of the reasons you want to quit (i.e. Your health, your family, finances, to impress girls) on a sturdy piece of paper and keep it with you at all times. When you feel a craving come on, take it out and slowly read through each item until you are reminded exactly why you are quitting.   Practice  deep breathing  techniques. When an urge arises, count slowly to ten while taking deep, full breathes of air. Concentrate on a comforting image in your mind and  let yourself work through the craving.   Learn to  recognize and anticipate triggers  - those situations that cause you to want to smoke a cigarette. If you can learn to anticipate those triggers, you will have a better chance of avoiding situations that cause them.  Find out  what relaxes you , helps you release stress, and makes you calm. Maybe it's soothing music, a hot bath,  meditation , prayer, reading a book, or a combination of more than one. Do these things often, especially if you feel a nicotine craving coming on.   Join a  Nicotine support group . Whether it is an in-person group meeting or an online discussion forum, having the support, encouragement and sympathy of other people in your situation will make the process of staying quit much easier. Go to the official site of  Nicotine Anonymous  to find a support group in your area, or see About.com's page on  Quit Smoking Support Groups .  Don't smoke!  Not even one cigarette. Not even a puff. You may be tempted to have just one cigarette to get you through a particularly stressful time, or because it's a special occasion, or any number of other excuses that you can use to justify smoking. Don't do it. This is the surest way to a relapse. Stop and think about all the work you've put in so far and how far you've come. Starting again will send you back to square one.      Stop Smoking Hotlines and Resources      Photo by Andrea Gomolak   One of the best things about quitting smoking  these days  is that there are lots of resources available to help people throughout the quitting process. Government and state sponsored programs have made millions of dollars in resources available to organizations that help individuals quit smoking. Whether you have a quick question on what medications may work best for you, or just need some encouraging words during a difficult period, Stop Smoking hotlines can be a valuable resource people who need professional help. Here are just a few of the resources available:      National Cancer Society   Instant Messaging:    LiveHelp  is an online resource for people who want to get real time information and advice on quitting smoking from a smoking cessation counselor. See their site for hours of operation.

Because of the lack of scientific research that has been done on many of these methods, we here at  Mahalo  can not vouch for the effectiveness of any of these methods. Here are a few of the most common:      Hypnosis      Hypnotherapy   Hypnotherapy  and Self-Hypnosis are methods that are used to help patients break through conditioned behaviors (such as smoking) and to replace them with new behaviors that don't involve harmful activities. During this process, patients are put into a deeply relaxed, sleep-like state of heightened awareness in which they are more susceptible to suggestions or prompting instructions. Certain keywords and phrases are introduced to the person under hypnosis that are aimed at reducing the patient's desire to smoke. There has been much debate about whether or not this method is effective after the hypnosis treatments have stopped. And success may also depend on each individuals natural susceptibility to hypnosis.    Amazon:  Stop Smoking Hypnosis (MP3 Downloads)   (Partner)       Acupuncture      Acupuncture   Acupuncture  is an alternative health technique in which fine needle points are inserted into the skin at different points. Proponents of acupuncture believe that placing needles at specific points on the body can help improve the patient's health and well-being. While acupuncture can lead to the release of  endorphins  into the body, producing a natural high, most health professionals do not believe that acupuncture is an effective long-term method for helping people quit smoking.

Aversion Therapy  is a form of behavioral modification that attempts to reinforce the negative aspects of smoking cigarettes and create negative associations whenever a smoker lights up. Some forms of aversion therapy include the rapid and constant smoking of cigarettes - while concentrating on the unpleasant sensations of smoking, using silver acetate to give cigarettes an unpleasant taste, and even the administering of brief electrical shocks whenever a smoker tries to light a cigarette.      Facts About Nicotine Addiction      Tobacco Crops   Nicotine  is the Psychoactive drug found in Tobacco products that, when ingested, gives the user a mildly euphoric feeling. It is also the chemical which users become addicted to. [8]   Research  has shown that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or alcohol. [9]   Nicotine dependence is the   most common form of chemical dependence  in the United States. [10]   The average cigarette contains 1 to 2 mg of nicotine that, when ingested, is  rapidly distributed to the brain  within 10 seconds of inhalation. [11]   Nicotine increases the flow of  Dopamine  to the brain, which causes that ""euphoric"" feeling. [12]       Benefits of Quitting Smoking   Quitting smoking  decreases the risk of  lung cancer ,  heart attacks ,  stroke , chonic lung disease and a variety of other types of cancers. [13]     Quitting smoking  can help stop the effects of tobacco on your appearance, such as: premature wrinkling,  bad breath , stained teeth, yellow fingernails and  gum disease . [14]    Quitting smoking can decrease the health risk to loved ones and those around you. [15]    Quitting smoking can help improve your sense of smell and taste. [16]    With the price of cigarettes at an all-time high, quitting smoking can save you a ton of money. Use this  Smoking Cost Calculator  to see how much you spend on cigarettes, and what you could have bought with that money.

Thousands of people each year begin the difficult process of eliminating cigarettes and tobacco from their lives. Some may try to quit cold turkey, others may need the added help that a nicotine replacement therapy can provide, and some people may turn to alternative therapies to help them quit. But it is important to realize that each person is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. So find out what works best for you, and stick with it as long as you can. And if the first time doesn't work, then try again. Because the benefits of being smoke-free easily outweigh the tough times you will go through to get there. Good Luck!

If you have made the decision to quit smoking, congratulations! Not only will you improve your own health, you will also protect the health of your loved ones by no longer exposing them to secondhand smoke.               We know how hard it can be to quit smoking. Did you know that many people try to quit two or three times before they give up smoking for good? Nicotine is a very addictive drug—as addictive as heroin and cocaine. The good news is that millions of people have given up smoking for good. It's hard work to quit, but you can do it! Freeing yourself of an expensive habit that is dangerous to your health and the health of others will make you feel great!               Many women who smoke worry that they will gain weight if they quit. In fact, nearly 80 percent of people who quit smoking do gain weight, but the average weight gain is just five pounds. Keep in mind, however, that 56 percent of people who continue to smoke will gain weight too. The bottom line: The health benefits of quitting far exceed any risks from the weight gain that may follow quitting.                            How to Quit               Research has shown that these five steps will help you to quit for good:                               Pick a date to stop smoking.  Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home. Write down why you want to quit and keep this list as a reminder.                 Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers.  Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out.  Get more support ideas .                  Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine.  When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.                 Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.  Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking. These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly. There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms. Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:                                      nicotine patch : worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin                      nicotine gum or lozenge : releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth                      nicotine nasal spray : inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream                      nicotine inhaler : inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat                      bupropion : an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke                      varenicline (Chantix™) : a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking                                                   Be prepared for relapse.  Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting. Don't get discouraged if you relapse. Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good. Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit. Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success. Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking. These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed. Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.                              Where to Get Help               Get more help if you need it. Join a quit-smoking program or support group to help you quit. These programs can help you handle withdrawal and stress and teach you skills to resist the urge to smoke. Contact your local hospital, health center, or health department for information about quit-smoking programs and support groups in your area.

To read the full review and see our findings and results, click on the name of the quit smoking product below.      As you can see from our list, we only chose to include those products that satisfied a majority of our criteria. This year, we only chose to include only the top four over-the-counter quit smoking brands. These four products not only demonstrated high overall effectiveness, but also were easy to use, had low occurrences of side effects, and had a high success rate. All four are also backed by the companies that make them, as evidenced by their 100% money back guarantees.                   Quit Smoking Product Ratings                       1.

This product really has become the ""supplement of choice"" for those looking to quit smoking. Not only did Nicocure prove itself very effective, it was also well-tolerated by all of our test subjects.        Another reason for this products high rank is it's very high success rate, meaning nearly everyone we had try this product saw results to some degree. In fact, a number of respondents experienced reduced withdrawal symptoms to a degree you would normally not expect from an all-natural product. We attribute this to not only the combination of ingredients found in this product but also the quality of these ingredients.        As for the makers of Nicocure, we have nothing but good things to say. They offer a host of convenient customer service and ordering options such as live chat and a 1-800 number.
