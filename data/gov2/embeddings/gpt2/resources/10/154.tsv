Absence from school is not permissible without reasonable explanation and cause. Attendance rate is the ratio of the number of actual student attendance days to the number of student attendance days which would occur if every student were present every school day. Suspension is the temporary exclusion of a student from school for disciplinary reasons for one full school day or longer. ""In-school suspensions"" are not included in this measure. For this table, a student who has been suspended is counted once, regardless of the number of times he or she was suspended. School policies concerning suspension of students may vary from school to school and will affect the suspension rates shown. The suspension rate is the ratio of students suspended to the fall enrollment.  Are many students excluded from school for one or more days for disciplinary reasons?

All schools in this group are elementary level schools in urban or suburban school districts with high student needs in relation to district resources. The schools in this group are in the middle range of student needs for elementary level schools in these districts.  1  Staff reported here serve only students in this building. Other district-employed staff who serve in more than one building may also provide service to these students.  01-01-00-01-0014 Montessori Magnet School  March 28, 2000  7   School Accountability Measures The Regents expect schools to meet or exceed 90 percent on each benchmark shown here. Regulations require school districts to develop and implement local assistance plans (LAP) to bring every public school up to these levels. These plans must include activities to improve the performance of all students, including students with disabilities. LAP for district public schools are available for public review at the district office. Only general education students continuously enrolled from October until the date of State testing at this school are included in these measures. Students with disabilities are not included1. Also, schools with fewer than 20 students in a category may combine results for the last three years to reduce the impact of small-population variability. Local school officials have this information.

Some schools with high mobility grade 11 populations may not have their LAP status correctly identified in this report. These numbers are, however, indicative of performance in all schools. # A pound sign appears when fewer than five students were in the basis group for a comparison.

GX063-73-7054603	Administrative         Options for Serving the Gifted           Among the many options         available for serving gifted students, the Regulations of the         Commissioner of Education require that school districts must make two         options available:           Eighth-Grade         Acceleration.     Public schools must make it possible for eight-grade         students to take high school courses in Regents mathematics and in at         least one of the following areas: English, social studies, second         language, art, music, occupational education subjects, Regents science         courses. ( Section 100.4 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of         Education .)                       >>>  The school         district staff decides whether a student has demonstrated readiness to         begin high school courses in the eighth grade.           >>>  If the         student passes the course, he or she will receive high school credit.                     Credit Through         Examination.  If a student has acquired the knowledge outside regular         courses, he or she may receive up to 61/2 credits toward graduation         without taking the courses. ( Section 100.5 of the Regulations of the         Commissioner of Education .) The student has this right if:                     >>>          The school         staff determines that he or she will benefit academically.           >>>  He or she         achieves a score of at least 85 percent on a State examination or an         examination approved by the State.           >>>  He or she         meets other requirements the school has, such as lab requirements, a         special project, or an oral examination.
