For More Information    References     Appendix I    Appendix II       Homeopathy (""home-ee-AH-pah-thy""), also known as homeopathic medicine, is a form of health care that developed in Germany and has been practiced in the United States since the early 19th century. Homeopathic practitioners are commonly called homeopaths. This fact sheet answers some frequently asked questions on homeopathy and reviews scientific research on its use and effectiveness.     Key Points       In homeopathy, a key premise is that every person has energy called a vital force or self-healing response. When this energy is disrupted or imbalanced, health problems develop. Homeopathy aims to stimulate the body's own healing responses.      Homeopathic treatment involves giving extremely small doses of substances that produce characteristic symptoms of illness in healthy people when given in larger doses. This approach is called ""like cures like.""       Various explanations have been proposed as to how homeopathy might work. However, none of these explanations has been scientifically verified.       Research studies on homeopathy have been contradictory in their findings. Some analyses have concluded that there is no strong evidence supporting homeopathy as effective for any clinical condition. However, others have found positive effects from homeopathy. The positive effects are not readily explained in scientific terms.      It is important to inform all of your health care providers about any therapy that you are currently using or considering, including homeopathic treatment. This is to help ensure a safe and coordinated course of care.        Top    1. What is homeopathy?    The term homeopathy comes from the Greek words  homeo , meaning similar, and  pathos , meaning suffering or disease. Homeopathy is an alternative medical system. Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice, and often have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States. a   Homeopathy takes a different approach from conventional medicine in diagnosing, classifying, and treating medical problems.    Key concepts of homeopathy include:    Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's defense mechanisms and processes so as to prevent or treat illness.     Treatment involves giving very small doses of substances called remedies that, according to homeopathy, would produce the same or similar symptoms of illness in healthy people if they were given in larger doses.     Treatment in homeopathy is individualized (tailored to each person). Homeopathic practitioners select remedies according to a total picture of the patient, including not only symptoms but lifestyle, emotional and mental states, and other factors.        a. Conventional medicine, as defined by NCCAM, is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. To find out more about these terms, see the NCCAM fact sheet "" What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine? ""    Top    2. What is the history of the discovery and use of homeopathy? b    In the late 1700s, Samuel Hahnemann, a physician, chemist, and linguist in Germany, proposed a new approach to treating illness. This was at a time when the most common medical treatments were harsh, such as bloodletting, c   purging, blistering, and the use of sulfur and mercury. At the time, there were few effective medications for treating patients, and knowledge about their effects was limited.     Hahnemann was interested in developing a less-threatening approach to medicine. The first major step reportedly was when he was translating an herbal text and read about a treatment (cinchona bark) used to cure malaria. He took some cinchona bark and observed that, as a healthy person, he developed symptoms that were very similar to malaria symptoms. This led Hahnemann to consider that a substance may create symptoms that it can also relieve. This concept is called the ""similia principle"" or ""like cures like."" The similia principle had a prior history in medicine, from Hippocrates in Ancient Greece--who noted, for example, that recurrent vomiting could be treated with an emetic (such as ipecacuanha) that would be expected to make it worse--to folk medicine. 14 , 15  Another way to view ""like cures like"" is that symptoms are part of the body's attempt to heal itself--for example, a fever can develop as a result of an immune response to an infection, and a cough may help to eliminate mucus--and medication may be given to support this self-healing response.     Hahnemann tested single, pure substances on himself and, in more dilute forms, on healthy volunteers. He kept meticulous records of his experiments and participants' responses, and he combined these observations with information from clinical practice, the known uses of herbs and other medicinal substances, and toxicology, d   eventually treating the sick and developing homeopathic clinical practice.     Hahnemann added two additional elements to homeopathy:        A concept that became ""potentization,"" which holds that systematically diluting a substance, with vigorous shaking at each step of dilution, makes the remedy more, not less, effective by extracting the vital essence of the substance. If dilution continues to a point where the substance's molecules are gone, homeopathy holds that the ""memory"" of them--that is, the effects they exerted on the surrounding water molecules--may still be therapeutic.       A concept that treatment should be selected based upon a total picture of an individual and his symptoms, not solely upon symptoms of a disease. Homeopaths evaluate not only a person's physical symptoms but her emotions, mental states, lifestyle, nutrition, and other aspects. In homeopathy, different people with the same symptoms may receive different homeopathic remedies.       Hans Burch Gram, a Boston-born doctor, studied homeopathy in Europe and introduced it into the United States in 1825. European immigrants trained in homeopathy also made the treatment increasingly available in America. In 1835, the first homeopathic medical college was established in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By the turn of the 20th century, 8 percent of all American medical practitioners were homeopaths, and there were 20 homeopathic medical colleges and more than 100 homeopathic hospitals in the United States.     In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous medical advances were made, such as the recognition of the mechanisms of disease; Pasteur's germ theory; the development of antiseptic techniques; and the discovery of ether anesthesia. In addition, a report (the so-called ""Flexner Report"") was released that triggered major changes in American medical education. Homeopathy was among the disciplines negatively affected by these developments. Most homeopathic medical schools closed down, and by the 1930s others had converted to conventional medical schools.    In the 1960s, homeopathy's popularity began to revive in the United States. According to a 1999 survey of Americans and their health, over 6 million Americans had used homeopathy in the preceding 12 months. 16  The World Health Organization noted in 1994 that homeopathy had been integrated into the national health care systems of numerous countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico. 7  Several schools of practice exist within homeopathy. 17    Persons using homeopathy do so to address a range of health concerns, from wellness and prevention to treatment of injuries, diseases, and conditions. Studies have found that many people who seek homeopathic care seek it for help with a chronic medical condition. 18 , 19 , 20  Many users of homeopathy treat themselves with homeopathic products and do not consult a professional. 13      b. Items 1-13 in the references served as general sources for this historical discussion.     c. Bloodletting was a healing practice used for many centuries. In bloodletting, incisions were made in the body to drain a quantity of blood, in the belief that this would help drain out the ""bad blood"" or sickness.     d. Toxicology is the science of the effects of chemicals on human health.     Top    3. What kind of training do homeopathic practitioners receive?     In European countries, training in homeopathy is usually pursued either as a primary professional degree completed over 3 to 6 years or as postgraduate training for doctors. 14      In the United States, training in homeopathy is offered through diploma programs, certificate programs, short courses, and correspondence courses. Also, homeopathic training is part of medical education in naturopathy. e   Most homeopathy in the United States is practiced along with another health care practice for which the practitioner is licensed, such as conventional medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, acupuncture, or veterinary medicine (homeopathy is used to treat animals).    Laws about what is required to practice homeopathy vary among states. Three states (Connecticut, Arizona, and Nevada) license medical doctors specifically for homeopathy.     e. Naturopathy, also known as naturopathic medicine, is an alternative medical system that emphasizes natural healing approaches (such as herbs, nutrition, and movement or manipulation of the body).  Some elements of naturopathy are similar to homeopathy, such as an intent to support the body's own self-healing response.    Top      4. What do homeopathic practitioners do in treating patients?    Typically, in homeopathy, patients have a lengthy first visit, during which the provider takes an in-depth assessment of the patient. This is used to guide the selection of one or more homeopathic remedies. During followup visits, patients report how they are responding to the remedy or remedies, which helps the practitioner make decisions about further treatment.     Top     5. What are homeopathic remedies?     Most homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals. A remedy is prepared by diluting the substance in a series of steps (as discussed in  Question 2 ). Homeopathy asserts that this process can maintain a substance's healing properties regardless of how many times it has been diluted. Many homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted that not one molecule of the original natural substance remains. 12 , 21  Remedies are sold in liquid, pellet, and tablet forms.     Top     6. How does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate homeopathic remedies?    Because of their long use in the United States, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 1938 declaring that homeopathic remedies are to be regulated by the FDA in the same manner as nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, which means that they can be purchased without a physician's prescription. Today, although conventional prescription drugs and new OTC drugs must undergo thorough testing and review by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before they can be sold, this requirement does not apply to homeopathic remedies.     Remedies are required to meet certain legal standards for strength, quality, purity, and packaging. In 1988, the FDA required that all homeopathic remedies list the indications for their use (i.e., the medical problems to be treated) on the label. 22 , 23  The FDA also requires the label to list ingredients, dilutions, and instructions for safe use.     The guidelines for homeopathic remedies are found in an official guide, the  Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States , which is authored by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization of industry representatives and homeopathic experts. 24  The  Pharmacopoeia  also includes provisions for testing new remedies and verifying their clinical effectiveness. Remedies on the market before 1962 have been accepted into the  Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States  based on historical use, rather than scientific evidence from clinical trials.     Top      7. Have any side effects or complications been reported from the use of homeopathy?    The FDA has learned of a few reports of illness associated with the use of homeopathic remedies. However, the FDA reviewed these reports and decided that the remedies were not likely to be the cause, because of the high dilutions. 3    Here is some general information that has been reported about risks and side effects in homeopathy:       Homeopathic medicines in high dilutions, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are considered safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions. 25      Some patients report feeling worse for a brief period of time after starting homeopathic remedies. Homeopaths interpret this as the body temporarily stimulating symptoms while it makes an effort to restore health.      Liquid homeopathic remedies can contain alcohol and are permitted to have higher levels of alcohol than conventional drugs for adults. This may be of concern to some consumers. However, no adverse effects from the alcohol levels have been reported either to the FDA or in the scientific literature. 3      Homeopathic remedies are not known to interfere with conventional drugs; however, if you are considering using homeopathic remedies, you should discuss this with your health care provider. If you have more than one provider, discuss it with each one.      As with all medicinal products, a person taking a homeopathic remedy is best advised to:        Contact his health care provider if his symptoms continue unimproved for more than 5 days.      Keep the remedy out of the reach of children.      Consult a health care provider before using the product if the user is a woman who is pregnant or nursing a baby.      Top     8. What has scientific research found out about whether homeopathy works?    This section summarizes results from (1) individual clinical trials (research studies in people) and (2) broad analyses of groups of clinical trials.     The results of individual, controlled clinical trials of homeopathy have been contradictory. In some trials, homeopathy appeared to be no more helpful than a placebo; in other studies, some benefits were seen that the researchers believed were greater than one would expect from a placebo. f    Appendix I  details findings from clinical trials.     Systematic reviews and meta-analyses take a broader look at collections of a set of results from clinical trials. g   Recent examples of these types of analyses are detailed in  Appendix II . In sum, systematic reviews have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition. Two groups of authors listed in  Appendix II  found some positive evidence in the groups of studies they examined, and they did not find this evidence to be explainable completely as placebo effects (a third group found 1 out of 16 trials to have some added effect relative to placebo). Each author or group of authors criticized the quality of evidence in the studies. Examples of problems they noted include weaknesses in design and/or reporting, choice of measuring techniques, small numbers of participants, and difficulties in replicating results. A common theme in the reviews of homeopathy trials is that because of these problems and others, it is difficult or impossible to draw firm conclusions about whether homeopathy is effective for any single clinical condition.    f. A placebo is designed to resemble as much as possible the treatment being studied in a clinical trial, except that the placebo is inactive. An example of a placebo is a pill containing sugar instead of the drug or other substance being studied. By giving one group of participants a placebo and the other group the active treatment, the researchers can compare how the two groups respond and get a truer picture of the active treatment's effects. In recent years, the definition of placebo has been expanded to include other things that could have an effect on the results of health care, such as how a patient and a health care provider interact, how a patient feels about receiving the care, and what he or she expects to happen from the care.    g. In a systematic review, data from a set of studies on a particular question or topic are collected, analyzed, and critically reviewed. A meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to analyze results from individual studies.     Top     9. Are there scientific controversies associated with homeopathy?     Yes. Homeopathy is an area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that has seen high levels of controversy and debate, largely because a number of its key concepts do not follow the laws of science (particularly chemistry and physics).        It is debated how something that causes illness might also cure it.      It has been questioned whether a remedy with a very tiny amount (perhaps not even one molecule) of active ingredient could have a biological effect, beneficial or otherwise.   There have been some research studies published on the use of ultra-high dilutions (UHDs) of substances, diluted to levels compatible with those in homeopathy and shaken hard at each step of dilution. h   The results are claimed to involve phenomena at the molecular level and beyond, such as the structure of water, and waves and fields. Both laboratory research and clinical trials have been published. There have been mixed results in attempts to replicate them. Reviews have not found UHD results to be definitive or compelling. i      There have been some studies that found effects of UHDs on isolated organs, plants, and animals. 15  There have been controversy and debate about these findings as well.        Effects in homeopathy might be due to the placebo or other non-specific effect.      There are key questions about homeopathy that are yet to be subjected to studies that are well-designed--such as whether it actually works for some of the diseases or medical conditions for which it is used, and if so, how it might work.      There is a point of view that homeopathy does work, but that modern scientific methods have not yet explained why. The failure of science to provide full explanations for all treatments is not unique to homeopathy.       Some people feel that if homeopathy appears to be helpful and safe, then scientifically valid explanations or proofs of this alternative system of medicine are not necessary.        h. For some examples, see references  26-29 .     i. For examples of debates on UHDs and reviewers' papers, see especially references  13 ,  15 , and  30-33 .      Top     10. Is NCCAM funding research on homeopathy?    Yes, NCCAM supports a number of studies in this area. For example:       Homeopathy for physical, mental, and emotional symptoms of fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder involving widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points on the body, and fatigue).       Homeopathy for brain deterioration and damage in animal models for stroke and dementia.       The homeopathic remedy cadmium, to find out whether it can prevent damage to the cells of the prostate when those cells are exposed to toxins.

Clinical Trials on Homeopathy Published from 1998 to 2002 j              Citation        Description        Findings           Vickers and Smith, 2002 34        Seven trials were included in the review (three prevention and four treatment trials); only two studies had sufficient information for complete data extraction.        The homeopathic remedy oscillococcinum appears safe and effective in reducing the duration of  influenza , but has no effect on prevention.             Lewith et al., 2002 28        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 242 participants aged 18 to 55 years.         Trial compared an oral homeopathic treatment to placebo in  asthmatic people allergic to house dust . Authors found the homeopathic treatment ""no better than placebo."" They noted ""some differences between the homeopathic immunotherapy and placebo for which we have no explanation.""              Oberbaum et al., 2001 35        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 32 children; 30 completed the study.        Traumeel S, a homeopathic skin cream, may significantly reduce the severity and length of  pain and inflammation of the tissues lining the inside of the mouth from chemotherapy  in children being treated with bone marrow transplantation.             Taylor et al., 2000 36        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 51 participants aged 17 years or older (50 completed the study).           Team tested the hypothesis that homeopathy is a placebo by examining effects of an oral homeopathic preparation in patients with  perennial allergic rhinitis . They found a ""significant objective improvement in nasal airflow"" compared with the placebo group. However, both groups reported subjective improvement in ""nasal symptoms"" (with no statistically significant difference between groups).  Authors concluded that the objective evidence supports that ""homeopathic dilutions differ from placebo.""              Jacobs et al., 2000 37        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 126 children; 116 completed the study.        Individualized homeopathic treatments improved digestive problems in children with  acute childhood diarrhea . Results are consistent with findings of a previous study.             Weiser et al., 1999 38        Randomized, double-blinded trial of 146 people.        For the treatment of  hay fever , a homeopathic nasal spray is as efficient and well tolerated as a conventional therapy, cromolyn sodium.             Rastogi et al., 1999 39        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 100 people between 18 and 50 (71 percent male/29 percent female).        A subgroup of patients with  HIV  in the symptomatic phase, receiving treatment, had increased levels of CD4 cells at the end of the trial; the placebo subgroup did not.             Vickers et al., 1998 40        Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 519 people; 400 completed the study.        Homeopathic remedies, including arnica, are not effective for  muscle soreness  following long-distance running.             Weiser et al., 1998 41        Randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of 119 people; 105 completed the study.        The homeopathic treatment vertigoheel, and the standard treatment of betahistine, are equally effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of  vertigo attacks .         j. Due to the large number of trials, these studies have been selected to give a representative overview of the findings published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals in English and indexed in the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database.    Top     Appendix II.    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses k  of Clinical Trials of Homeopathy                Citation        Description        Findings           Ernst, 2002 33        Analyzed 17 systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) of controlled clinical trials for homeopathy.        Author found that the reviews failed to provide strong evidence in favor of homeopathy. No homeopathic remedy was proven by convincing evidence to yield clinical effects that are different from placebo or from other control intervention for any medical condition.  Positive recommendations for use of homeopathy in clinical practice are not supported, and ""homeopathy cannot be viewed as an evidence-based form of therapy"" until more convincing results are available.              Linde et al., 2001 42        Analyzed the methodological quality of 207 randomized trials collected for 5 previously published reviews on homeopathy, two herbal medicines (St. John's wort and echinacea), and acupuncture.        Authors found that the majority of trials had major weaknesses in methodology and/or reporting. Homeopathy trials were ""less frequently randomized...and reported less details on dropouts and withdrawals"" than the other types.              Cucherat et al., 2000 17        Analyzed 16 randomized, controlled trials (17 comparisons were made) comparing homeopathic treatment to placebo.  Work was part of a report prepared for the European Union on the effectiveness of homeopathy.         Authors found that the ""strength of evidence remains low"" because of trial flaws and other limitations. They added that ""at least one [of the tested homeopathic treatments] shows an added effect relative to placebo."" Group recommended that homeopathy be studied further using the same methods used to study conventional medicine.              Ernst and Pittler, 1998 43        Systematic review of eight trials.        Rigorous clinical trials indicate arnica is not more effective than a placebo; most trials studied use of arnica for  tissue trauma .              Linde et al., 1997 6        Analyzed 89 trials. Each trial was controlled; compared homeopathy to a placebo; was either randomized or double-blinded; and yielded a written report.         Authors concluded that their results were not compatible with a hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy are completely due to placebo.  However, they found insufficient evidence that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition.  They stated that further research is warranted if it is rigorous and systematic.              Kleijnen et al., 1991 21        Assessed 105 controlled trials of homeopathy, 68 randomized.         Authors found a positive trend in the evidence, regardless of the quality of the trial or the method of homeopathy used. They cautioned, however, that definitive conclusions about homeopathy could not be drawn, because many of the trials were not of good quality and the role of publication bias was unknown.              Systematic Reviews of Clinical Trials on Single Medical Conditions             Long and Ernst, 2001 44        Systematic review of four osteoarthritis clinical trials.        Research on homeopathic treatment for  osteoarthritis  is insufficient to reliably assess the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis.              Jonas et al., 2000 45        Meta-analysis of six controlled clinical trials.        Controlled clinical trials indicate that homeopathic remedies appear to work better than a placebo in studies of  rheumatic syndromes , but there are too few studies to draw definitive conclusions, and efficacy results are mixed.          k.

GX253-16-13500810	"SUMMARY OF DATA FOR CHEMICAL SELECTION Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids BASIS OF NOMINATION Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids from herbal sources (ephedra) are brought to the attention of the CSWG as part of an ongoing National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) research initiative on the safety and efficacy of these products. This initiative was recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations in fiscal year (FY) 2001. In its Report making FY 2002 appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Committee expressed pleasure that the ODS followed through on its FY 2001 recommendation and urged the ODS to continue and expand this important effort. The nomination of ephedracontaining supplements to the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is part of the expanded effort by the ODS. As the Senate Committee noted, the number of Americans taking dietary supplements containing ephedra has risen dramatically. Dietary supplements containing herbal ephedra (chiefly Ephedra sinica Stapf.) are widely used as diet aids and athletic performance enhancers, with over 3 billion servings1 sold each year for weight loss alone. The active ingredients in these supplements are primarily ephedrine and pseudoephedrine with small amounts of other ephedrine alkaloids usually present. Ephedra-based diet aids often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine (guarana), as well as salicin, diuretics, and cathartics. Ephedra-containing performance enhancers often contain caffeine and other ingredients, such as chromium picolinate or l-carnitine, and may be consumed with other performance enhancers, such as androstenedione and creatine monohydrate. The ephedrine alkaloids are sympathomimetic amines, a class of compounds with fairly well characterized short to medium term biological activities. Specific combinations of synthetic ephedrine and caffeine have been used as prescription drugs in Europe, and were formerly available in the US until they were withdrawn by the FDA in 1992 for reasons of safety. Very little is known 1  Dose or portion, in this case, is referred to as a ""serving"" because diet aids are defined as foods.  1   about the possible interactions between herbal ephedra and biologically active compounds in the other plant species that are constituents of many dietary supplements. Some agents, often components of herbal preparations at far greater concentrations than the ephedrine alkaloids, may profoundly influence the toxicity attributed to ephedra supplements. Limited information suggests that ephedrine may cause fetal heart defects, a matter that needs further examination since dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are readily available even though the manufacturers caution against their use during pregnancy. Ephedrine sulfate and caffeine, tested separately, were both negative for carcinogenic activity. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), through the Chemical Selection Working Group (CSWG), recently submitted several other ingredients commonly found in combination with ephedrine alkaloid sports supplements to the National Toxicology Program for toxicological testing. These include chromium picolinate, androstenedione, and yohimbe bark extract. INPUT FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES/INDUSTRY: Dr. Paul Coates, Director of the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, provided information on existing studies of ephedra. SELECTION STATUS: Action By CSWG: 12/11/01 Studies requested: - Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies - Comparative toxicological evaluation using ephedra, ephedra and natural caffeine products, and other combinations of ephedra/herbal remedies with an emphasis on the heart and central nervous system Priority: High  2   Rationale/Remarks: - Herbal ephedrine alkaloids (ma huang) combined with other herbal products are widely used as diet aids and for performance enhancement. - Concern that naturally occurring non-ephedrine alkaloid constituents of Ephedra spp. may have toxicologic significance. - Concern that the herbal combinations used as dietary supplements may possess toxicity not seen from administration of synthetic ephedrine/caffeine combinations. - Emphasize testing of products/combinations actually marketed to consumers as dietary supplements. - Priority for testing should be given to combinations of herbals used as diet aids. - Involve the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and the FDA in study design of to ensure that the testing performed addresses their concerns.  3   Ephedrine alkaloids  CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION CAS Registry Number: Ephedrine alkaloids: none l-Ephedrine; (-)-ephedrine: 299-42-3 d-Pseudoephedrine; (+)-pseudoephedrine: 90-82-4 None Chinese Ephedra, Chinese Jointfir, herbal ephedra, ma huang Botanical mixture  CAS Name: Synonyms and Trade Names: Structural Class:  Structure, Molecular Formula and Molecular Weight: This information is provided for the main active ingredients in ephedrine alkaloid supplements.

Pure or synthetic ephedrine is considered to be a drug, not a dietary supplement; in fact, a company was recently fined, and all of its product seized, for ""spiking"" its ma huang-containing extracts with synthetic ephedrine (Coates, 2001). The most commonly used herbal ephedra, ma huang contains total ephedrine alkaloids at 0.52.5% by weight; ephedrine accounts for 30-90% of these alkaloids (Lee et al., 2000). Because of the variation in content, ma huang is mostly used as an extract, concentrated to about 6% alkaloids (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). The alkaloid pattern can often lead to identification of the species, the geographical area where it grew and the climatic conditions, while atypical patterns can suggest that a ma huang sample is ""fake"", made from pharmaceutical raw materials (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). Twenty commercially available diet aids containing ephedrine alkaloids were tested by HPLC procedures. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in a 2:1 ratio accounted for 96-98% of the ephedrine alkaloid content. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) content was less than 2% of the total ephedrine alkaloid content. Additional ephedrine alkaloids, (+)-norpseudoephedrine (cathine), a Schedule IV controlled substance, and methylephedrine have been identified in 5 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  small amounts in ma huang and in extracts prepared from ma huang (CANTOX, 2000; Gurley et al., 2000; Kalix, 1991; Lwanami et al., 1985). Among the 20 dietary supplements examined, ephedrine alkaloid content varied considerably suggesting that industry standards are often not met by individual supplements. Total alkaloid content ranged from 0.0 to 18.5 mg per dosage unit. Ranges for (-)-ephedrine and (+)pseudoephedrine were 1.1-15.3 mg and 0.2-9.5 mg, respectively. Significant lot-to-lot variations in alkaloid content, from 44 to 260% of label claim, were also observed. Half the products exhibited discrepancies between the label claim for ephedrine alkaloid content and actual alkaloid content in excess of 20% (CANTOX, 2000; Gurley et al., 2000). Most ephedra product labels indicate the amount of ephedra herb or extract contained in each dosage form; however, not all make a claim of ephedrine alkaloid content (CANTOX, 2000). Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids generally contain a host of other botanical ingredients. Kola nut and guarana are used as natural caffeine sources; St. John's Wort, white willow bark (salicin), diuretics, or cathartics are also often included (CANTOX, 2000). Performance enhancers may include chromium picolinate or l-carnitine (Karch, 2000). Yohimbine is sometimes added (Bucci, 2000).  6 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  EXPOSURE INFORMATION Production and Producers: Dietary supplements containing botanical sources of ephedrine alkaloids are marketed for weight loss and increased energy. These products are available in a variety of forms, including pills, powders, liquid drops, and teas (GAO, 1999). Herbal ephedra products are sold via traditional retail chains (drug stores, health food stores, etc.), mail-order catalogs, and direct sales distribution networks. Industry sources estimate that there are over 500,000-750,000 independent distributors of dietary supplements that contain herbal ephedra (Pape et al., 1999). Most companies marketing herbal ephedra are privately held and do not report sales and earnings figures to the public. Nevertheless, retail sales of these dietary supplement products are conservatively estimated to exceed $1.5 - $2 billion per year (Pape et al., 1999). In testimony to the Office on Women's Health, industry sources estimated that 3 billion doses of ephedra-containing products are sold in the United States annually. This figure appears to be low. The American Herbal Products Association contacted 42 companies known to distribute dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. The 13 companies that responded reported aggregate figures of 3,086,041,072 servings sold in 1999. Metabolife International reported that projected sales of one ephedrine alkaloid weight-loss product, Metabolife 356, were nearly 2 billion caplets in that same year (Anon., 1999; CANTOX, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). Use Pattern: Ma huang is derived from Ephedra sinica Stapf, E. intermedia Schrenk et C.A. Mey, and E. equisetina Bunge (Ephedraceae). North American and Central American types are alkaloid free (American Herbal Products Association, 1999). A traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used for about 5000 years to treat asthma, nose and lung congestion, and fever with anhidrosis. Ma huang's traditional use to treat cough and respiratory infections may be related to 4-quinolone-2-carboxylic acid 7 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  (transtorine) which inhibits the growth of several common bacteria. Large quantities of ma huang are now used as a source of ephedrine in dietary supplements formulated to promote weight loss. Ma huang products sold for weight control often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine, which may have synergistic effects and increase the potential for adverse effects (American Herbal Products Association, 1999; Botanical Dermatology Database, 2001; FDA, 1993; Office on Women's Health, 2000; Karch, 2000; Lee et al., 2000). The best selling herbal weight-loss product is Metabolife 356 (Anon., 1999). According to its manufacturer, Metabolife 356 contains vitamin E, magnesium chelate, zinc chelate, chromium picolinate, guarana (seed), ma huang extract, bee pollen, Siberian ginseng (root), ginger root, lecithin, bovine complex, damiana (leaf), sarsaparilla root, goldenseal, nettle leaf, gotu kola, spirulina, Royal jelly, citric acid, glycine, caffeine, croscarmellose sodium, protein hydrolysate, silica, modified cellulose, magnesium stearate, dextrin, dextrose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium citrate, and ascorbic acid (Metabolife, 2001). The exact amounts of each ingredient are proprietary, but each tablet contains 12 mg of ephedrine alkaloids and 40 mg of caffeine alkaloids (Metabolife, 2001). Ephedrine alkaloid/caffeine products are used by some athletes to enhance physical performance, especially bodybuilders who want to maximize body fat loss while maintaining muscle mass (Bucci, 2000). Ephedra is often taken along with other sports nutrition supplements, especially androstenedione and creatine monohydrate (Consumers Union, 2001). l-Ephedrine sulfate has FDA approval as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication for use in asthma patients. An  +  adrenergic agonist, ephedrine functions as a bronchodilator. Isolated and synthesized in 1885, ephedrine became a first-line drug against asthma in the 1930s, although this no longer appears to be an important use of ephedrine. Unlike the other alkaloid drugs, ephedrine is also a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that has been used as a drug of abuse, much like methamphetamine (McEvoy, 2000; 8 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Karch, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). In the past, ephedrine was used to treat Stokes-Adams attacks with complete heart block and as a CNS stimulant in narcolepsy and depressive states. Ephedrine has been used to treat the hypotension that may occur with spinal anesthesia (McEvoy, 2000). As an alternative for the structurally related illegal drug, Ecstasy (4-methyl-2-dimethoxyamphetamine, MDMA), ephedra supplements are sometimes sold outside usual channels of commerce and marketed specifically to young adults to achieve a legal high (FDA, 2000). These products may be spiked with synthetic ephedrine alkaloids and combined with other stimulants such as caffeine (Bucci, 2000). One of these products, Cloud 9, was labeled as containing 650 mg of Indonesian ma huang extract per capsule with a recommended dose of 1-2 capsules 30-35 minutes before activity (Blumenthal & King, 1996). The FDA considers Herbal Ecstasy to be a street drug alternative, not a dietary supplement. Since street drug alternatives have a potential for abuse, FDA considers them to be unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs under sections 505 and 502of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDA, 2000; US Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). Human Exposure: The two main groups that use ephedra products are young to middle age, overweight individuals, and young individuals engaged in exercise programs (Office on Women's Health, 2000). Results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999 indicate that an estimated 61% of US adults are either overweight or obese. In adults aged 20-74 years, obesity has nearly doubled from approximately 15% in 1980 to 27% in 1999 (CDC, 2001). According to industry sources, Americans spend more than $30 billion a year on diet-related products and services related to obesity treatment (Office on Women's Health, 2000). 9 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Ephedra supplement labels warn customers not to use herbal ephedra for more than 12 weeks. An industry spokesperson testified before the Office on Women's Health that this warning label is needed to comply with state laws and is not regarded by the industry as scientifically based (Office of Women's Health, 2000). On the other hand, there have been no published studies in which subjects have been given ephedra for longer than 12 weeks (Coates, 2001). Metabolife International advertises a ""preferred customer"" program that ships Metabolife 356 automatically every month without a specified time limit (Metabolife, 2001). A typical ephedra supplement for weight loss contains approximately 12 mg of ephedrine alkaloids per oral serving with a maximum daily intake of 96 mg recommended. Some products include as much as 20 mg of ephedra per dose, but those products recommend consumption of no more than 100 mg/day (Office on Women's Health, 2000). No information was found in the available literature on the number of persons taking ephedrine alkaloid diet aids. If 3 billion servings are taken at a rate of 8 per day for 12 weeks in the course of one year, then over 370,000 persons would be exposed annually for purposes of weight loss alone. According to Nutrition Business Journal, 4% of American adults have taken a sports supplement at least once and 1.2 million use them regularly. According to a 1999 survey by Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 6% of youths 15-16 and 8% of those 17-18 have taken sports supplements; the vast majority of users were male. Although ephedra was mentioned as one of the most popular supplements, estimates of the actual number of persons taking ephedra supplements for performance enhancement were not provided. Ephedra is often taken along with other sports nutrition supplements, e.g., androstenedione and creatine monohydrate (Consumers Union, 2001; Council for Responsible Nutrition, 2001). Ripped Fuel by Twin Labs is a popular supplement used by bodybuilders that contains ma huang, guarana, l-carnitine, and chromium picolinate. Another popular product is AST Research's EPH 833, composed mainly of ma huang. The ephedrine content of this 10 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  type of product ranges anywhere from 12-80 mg per serving (Karch, 2000). The recommended dosage for l-ephedrine sulfate as a bronchodilator is 25 mg (as ephedrine) with a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg (McEvoy, 2000; Office on Women's Health, 2000). The number of persons exposed to ephedrine through this and other medical uses is believed to be small. Environmental Occurrence: Ephedra sinica Stapf is one of 40 species in the Ephedraceae (Joint-Pine) family that occurs in northern and southern warm temperate regions. A perennial shrub indigenous to China, its dried young stems, harvested in fall, are used to produce ephedra alkaloids. Ephedra alkaloids can be derived from other species in the Ephedracea family as well, notably E. equisentina and E. gerardiana Wall (Pakistani ephedra). The alkaloid content and the relative quantities of different alkaloids vary widely among the various species; generally, the roots, berries, and seeds contain no alkaloids. Ephedra sinica Stapf is a natural source of the clinically important isomeric alkaloids, (-)-ephedrine and (+)-pseudoephedrine. These compounds differ only in their stereochemistry (Botanical Dermatology Database, 2001; Duke & Beckstrom-Sternberg, 2001; Karch, 2000; Nutritionfocus.com, 1999). Regulatory Status: Since 1994, dietary supplements have been regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). The DSHEA requires no proof of safety for dietary supplements on the market prior to October 15, 1994. Labeling requirements for dietary supplements allow warnings and dosage recommendation as well as substantiated ""structure or function"" claims. All claims must prominently note that they have not been evaluated by the FDA, and they must bear the statement ""This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"" (FDA, 1995). FDA has taken several actions to respond to a perceived public heath concern related to ephedrine alkaloid supplements. In 1994, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition issued a medical bulletin outlining potential adverse reactions from dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. In 1995, the FDA warned consumers not 11 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  to purchase or consume Nature's Nutrition Formula One products labeled as containing ma huang and kola nut because the product posed a risk to consumers' health. In October of that same year, FDA convened a special workgroup to address ephedrine alkaloid dietary supplements. In August 1996, FDA's Food Advisory Committee (FAC) was asked to provide opinions on specific ways to address ephedrine alkaloid supplements. Over half the members concluded that no safe level for ephedrine alkaloids could be identified and recommended that these products be removed from the market (FDA,1995; GAO, 1999). In June 1997, FDA published a proposed rule Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids (62 FR107) defining 8 mg as the amount of ephedrine alkaloids in a serving of dietary supplement above which the product would be deemed adulterated. Among other things, the proposed rule restricted daily dosages to 24 mg or less, required warning labels that product should not be used for more than 7 days, and prohibited use of ephedrine alkaloids with ingredients having a known stimulant effect (e.g., caffeine). FDA's proposed rule was extremely controversial, leading to a GAO audit which found the FDA's position to be deficient on a number of points. Portions of the proposal were withdrawn on April 3, 2000, and the FDA held public hearings to collect more information. To date a final rule has not been issued (FDA, 1997; GAO, 1999). Ephedrine is listed in and regulated by the 1988 UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Pape et al., 1999). Its use by athletes is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the International Olympic Committee, and recently, by the National Football League (Wilner, 2001; Vardigan, 2001). Since ephedrine became the precursor of choice for making methamphetamine, federal regulators have severely restricted its bulk sales (Karch, 2000). The complex matrix of ingredients present in herbal ephedra, however, is not conducive to easy conversion to methamphetamine (Pape et al., 1999).  12 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  To date, 28 states have taken action to restrict ephedrine use (Leikin & Klein, 1000). Under Ohio law, the maximum recommended dosage of ephedrine for a healthy adult is 100 mg in a 24-hour period for not more than 12 weeks (Metabolife, 2001). Texas law requires the following statement: ""This product has ephedrine group alkaloids in the form of herbal extracts and may cause serious adverse health effects""(Metabolife, 2001).  13 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  EVIDENCE FOR POSSIBLE TOXICOLOGIC ACTIVITY Human Data on Ephedrine and Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements: No epidemiological studies or case reports investigating the association between cancer and the ingestion of ephedrine or dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, either alone or in combination with caffeine, diuretics and cathartics, or herbal remedies to protect the heart, were identified in the available literature. Ephedrine alkaloids belong to a class of chemicals called the sympathomimetic amines. The biological activities of individual ephedrine alkaloids are well characterized, but the effects of combinations of these compounds, such as are found in dietary supplements, are less well known (CANTOX, 2000). In the US, sympathomimetic poisoning is a common toxicologic emergency. The 1999 annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' Toxic Exposure Surveillance System noted 29,023 sympathomimetic exposures, of which 16,599 were referred to a health care facility and 67 resulted in fatality. Toxicity typically presents with classic sympathomimetic signs and symptoms that include tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, agitation, and combativeness (Kolecki, 2001). In persons taking caffeine and ephedrine (often with other ingredients) for weight loss, adverse events appear to reach and remain at placebo levels after 4 to 12 weeks, but data from randomized trials are available only up to 6 months. Since obesity requires chronic treatment, controlled clinical trials of longer duration may be needed to assess whether the benefits outweigh risk, even for synthetic product combinations (Greenway, 2001). Overview of the Individual Ephedrine Alkaloids as Sympathomimetic Amines. Ephedrine: Ephedrine stimulates both - and -adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of 1receptors produces contraction of vascular smooth muscle, increased contractile force of the heart, and arrhythmias, as well as glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and hyperpolarization and relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle. Stimulation of 2-receptors decreases insulin secretion, platelet aggregation, and the release of norepinephrine from 14 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  the nerve terminals, but causes contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Stimulation of 1-receptors increases force and rate of contraction of the heart, increased velocity of conduction through the atrioventricular node, and increased renin secretion. The primary effects from stimulation of 2-adrenergic receptors with therapeutic doses of ephedrine are relaxation of the smooth muscle of the blood vessels and bronchi. Stimulation of 3adrenergic receptors causes lipolysis. In addition to its direct sympathomimetic effects, ephedrine can release norepinephrine from its storage sites (Mack, 1997). With prolonged use or frequent dosing, ephedrine depletes norepinephrine stores in sympathetic nerve endings. After several doses of ephedrine are administered, hypotension may result from direct cardiac depression and vasodilation. Ephedrine has CNS stimulating effects similar to those of amphetamines, but less pronounced (McEvoy, 2000). Pseudoephedrine: Pseudoephedrine acts directly on -adrenergic receptors in the respiratory tract mucosa producing vasoconstriction which results in shrinkage of swollen nasal mucous membranes, reduction of tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion and an increase in nasal airway patency. Drainage of sinus secretions is increased. Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine has an indirect effect by releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites. Pseudoephedrine acts on -adrenergic receptors to a lesser degree than ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine may relax bronchial smooth muscle by stimulation of 2adrenergic receptors. However, substantial bronchodilation following oral administration has not been demonstrated consistently. Usual doses of pseudoephedrine generally produce negligible effect on blood pressure in normotensive patients. Pseudoephedrine may increase the irritability of the heart muscle and may alter the rhythmic function of the ventricles, especially in large doses (McEvoy, 2000). Norephedrine: d,l-Norephedrine hydrochloride, better known as phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride (PPA), indirectly stimulates both - and -adrenergic receptors by releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites. Like pseudoephedrine, PPA produces vasoconstriction of the bronchial mucosa. PPA increases heart rate, force of contraction, 15 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  and cardiac output and excitability and causes CNS stimulation which may result in nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, dizziness, and headache. In some patients, severe reactions including headache, chest tightness, greatly elevated blood pressure, ventricular or atrial premature contractions, and paroxysms of ventricular and atrial tachycardia have occurred with therapeutic doses. Excessive doses may produce heart attack, stroke, intracranial bleeding, parenchyma cerebral hemorrhage, and death (McEvoy, 2000). A recently published study of 702 patients and 1376 control subjects suggested that PPA in appetite suppressants, and possibly in cough and cold remedies, is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke in women (Kernan et al., 2000). Early in 2001, FDA issued a public health advisory asking companies to stop marketing products containing PPA (Coates, 2001). Case Reports of Toxicity from Ingestion of Ephedrine or Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements. Toxicity of ephedrine occurs mostly in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems and includes hypertension, dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, seizures, anxiety, psychosis, stroke, and death (Powell et al., 1998). Case reports describing toxicity from the ingestion of ephedrine alkaloid supplements or ephedrine diet pills have been reported in the literature. Examples include:  Vasculitis and hypersensitivity myocarditis in a 39-year-old man who ingested Herbalife, a ma huang product (1-3 tablets twice daily for 3 months) (Zaacks et al., 1999). Cardiovascular toxicity in a 21-year-old man who ingested herbal ecstasy taken with alcohol and a marijuana cigarette. Caffeine may have contributed to the toxicity observed (Zahn et al., 1999). Death of a 23-year-old body builder who consumed Ripped Fuel ""according to the stated directions"" once or twice a day for >6 months. Autopsy revealed myocardial necrosis with healing of 1-2 weeks, mild fibrosis, and moderate myocyte hypertrophy and vascular congestion (Theoharides, 1997). Cerebral infarct in a 33-year-old sportsman consuming high doses of ma huang extract and creatine monohydrate (Vahedi et al., 2000). 16 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)         Ephedrine alkaloids     Thalamic infarct (stroke) in a 37-year-old man who ingested street-purchased ""speed"" containing ephedrine for weight loss (Bruno et al., 1993). Hemorrhagic stroke in a 19-year-old woman with a history of anorexia/bulemia and alcoholism after she ingested alcohol and 15-18 tablets containing 25 mg ephedrine and 100 mg guaifenesin (Matthews et al., 1997). Myocardial infarction in a previously healthy 19-year-old male bodybuilder after using tablets containing ephedra and caffeine (Traub et al., 2001). Three deaths from non-prescription diet aids or stimulants; ephedrine concentrations in the blood were 3.5-20.5 mg/L; corresponding blood caffeine concentrations (130 to 344 mg/L) were sufficient to be lethal (Garriott et al., 1985). Hepatitis in a previously well 33-year-old woman shortly after taking a Chinese medicine product containing ma huang (Nadir et al., 1996).       Cardiomyopathy has been reported in individuals who have taken high doses of ephedrine for prolonged durations, in one case 80 25-mg tablets daily for 8 years (Gualtieri & Harris, 1996). In another case, a 35-year old man developed cardiomyopathy following many years of ephedrine use at doses sometimes exceeding 400 mg/day for treatment of asthma (Van Mieghem et al., 1978). At the time of FDA's proposed rule, the FDA had received over 800 Adverse Event Reports (AERs) for products thought to contain ephedrine alkaloids, more AERS than for any other dietary supplement. FDA does not have the authority to require submission of reports of adverse events, and AERs are a passive monitoring tool that relies on voluntary reporting. Like all passive surveillance systems, AERs have certain limitations such as under-reporting and poor report quality (GAO, 1999). An independent review of 276 AERs conducted for the Ephedra Education Council, a trade association, contended that the FDA database contained numerous inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and omissions (Ephedra Education Panel, 2000). Because the FDA's use of AER data to support its proposed regulation of ephedrinealkaloids was widely criticized, the FDA requested an independent review of the AER 17 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  reports. A total of 140 reports of adverse effects related to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids submitted to FDA between June 1, 1997, and March 31, 1999, were examined. Of these cases, 31% were judged as definitely or probably related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31% were deemed to be possibly related. Among the adverse events deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related, 47% involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18% involved the CNS. Hypertension was the single most frequent adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13), stroke (10); and seizures (7). Ten events resulted in death and 13 events produced permanent disability (Haller & Benowitz, 2000). In a September 5, 2001 petition to the FDA to ban dietary supplements containing ephedra, Public Citizen contends that 1,398 of 3,308 AERs received by FDA between January 1993 and February 2000 were associated with ephedra and related substances. Among the 1,398 cases, there were 81 deaths, 32 heart attacks, 62 reports of cardiac arrhythmia, 91 reports of hypertension, 69 strokes, and 70 seizures. Public Citizen also noted an increase in adverse events associated with ephedra-containing supplements in data collected by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, which showed 211 events in 1997 vs 407 in 1999 (Public Citizen, 2001). In a single study, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) was reported to be associated with chronic ephedrine intake (Blau, 1998). In followup to a case of nephrolithiasis in a 27year old man who had taken 4-12 energy supplement tablets containing 170 mg of ma huang extract daily for 11 months, it was determined that 106 specimens from a total of 166,466 stones archived at a single facility contained ephedrine metabolites (Powell et al., 1998). In many of the case reports and AERs, alternative explanations for the cause of the adverse event are possible, or additional factors were present that may have contributed to the toxicity. Thus, the role of ephedra remains disputed. Effects of Ephedrine or Ephedra without Caffeine. 18 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  According to an industry spokesperson, an extensive literature review by Jewel and Binramache indicated that a single dose of 60 mg of ephedrine is required to cause a significant increase in blood pressure in healthy adults. The magnitude of this increase was 10-15 mm Hg (Office of Women's Health, 2000). A short-term (2 day) randomized crossover study involving 10 subjects (5 male, 5 female) compared the effects of ingesting three dietary supplements containing ma huang vs 25 mg ephedrine capsules. Although the dietary supplements also contained other herbal ingredients, the adverse effects reported (tachycardia, anxiety, headache, irritability, insomnia, and loss of appetite) were typical of ephedrine (Gurley et al., 1998). A second study examined the short-term effects of ingesting ma huang on heart rate and blood pressure in 12 normotensive subjects administered two doses (19.4 mg ephedrine, 4.9 mg pseudoephedrine, 1.2 mg methylephedrine) 9 hours apart. Six developed a statistically significant increase in heart rate and three had a nonsignificant increase. Four participants experienced statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure, but two had significant decreases in diastolic blood pressure (White et al. 1997). Using a double blind, placebo, crossover protocol, Kaats and Adelman (1994) demonstrated a significant loss of weight (P<0.01) and body fat (P<0.001) in 100 subjects administered a proprietary formulation that included ma huang over a 4-week period. No significant changes were observed in resting heart rates and blood pressure. 2  In a controlled study with exposures for up to a year, the effects of an ephedrine bronchodilator on the cardiovascular system were measured (Wilson et al., 1976). Baseline heart rate changed little in the ephedrine group. Both baseline systolic pressure and diastolic pressure fell progressively, particularly during the last 6 months. Study participants took ephedrine at 75 mg/day and terbutaline at 15 mg/day in 3 divided doses.  Whether this formulation contains caffeine could not be determined; the study sponsor manufactures Lite Bites which contain chromium picolinate and 22 vitamins and minerals (AMBI, Inc., 2001).  2  19 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Controlled Studies of Ephedrine/Ephedra and Caffeine. Ephedra-containing dietary supplement products reported to the FDA as causing adverse events have almost always contained large amounts of caffeine (150-300 mg per unit dose) in addition to ephedrine alkaloids (Bucci, 2000). Thus, the adverse events reported in controlled studies of such products are of interest. Several key papers are described below. Additional information is contained in CANTOX (2000). Single doses of placebo or ephedrine + caffeine (E+C) (10/200 mg; 20/100 mg; 20/200 mg) were administered to six healthy, lean subjects. The 3-hour post-intake increase in systolic blood pressure after all three combinations average 5-7 mm Hg more than placebo (P<0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was increased by approximately 4 mm Hg more than placebo only in the 10/200 and 20/100 groups. Heart rate was increased in the 20/100 and 20/200 groups (Astrup et al., 1991; Astrup & Toubro, 1993). In followup to the previous study, Astrup and coworkers (1992) conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study of 180 obese patients treated by diet, E+C (20 mg/200mg), ephedrine (20), caffeine (200), or placebo 3 times a day for 24 weeks. Weight losses were significantly greater in the E+C group than in the other groups, all of whom lost weight. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell in all four groups. Three E+C patients and one ephedrine patient withdrew because of adverse reactions. Approximately half of the E+C and ephedrine patients complained of transient symptoms (tremor, insomnia, dizziness). Nasser and coworkers (1999) conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week trial of Metabolife-356 (E, 72 mg/d; C, 240 mg/d) in healthy subjects. Of the 67 subjects, 7 dropped out before first follow-up, 5 on E+C: 1 with high blood pressure, 4 with heart palpitations. Of 60 with at least one follow-up visit, 12 dropped out before week 8, 6 on E+C: 2 with heart palpitations, 1 with irritability, and 1 with increased systolic blood pressure. Of the 48 subjects who completed the study, the 24 on E+C had greater changes in body weight, % body fat, and serum triglycerides, but they also reported increases in 20 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  dry mouth, heart palpitations, blood pressure, and insomnia. Boozer and coworkers (2000) studied of the effects of E+C in obese, but otherwise healthy subjects. A total of 69 persons ingested 90 mg ephedrine alkaloids and 192 mg caffeine daily, given as three equally divided doses. An additional 68 subjects received placebo. Statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were observed in the ephedra/caffeine group by week 4. A total of 46 subjects in the active group and 38 in the placebo group continued to participate in the study, extending the results through 6 months. Heart rate remained persistently increased although cardiac arrhythmias were not increased. Huber administered the weight-loss preparations, Nutra 1 (Lean-R-Gy: Thermogenic Weight Loss and Natural Energizer), Nutra 2 (Trim-4-Life), and Nutra 3 (ProTrim) to obese volunteers for 6 months. These products contained approximately 48, 24, and 72 mg ephedrine alkaloid/day, respectively, when used as directed3. Nutra 3 also contained 200 mg/day of caffeine when used as directed. Symptoms were stated to be of extremely low frequency; neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure were raised. The study was not blinded and there were no control groups, limiting its utility (American Herbal Products Association, 1999; CANTOX, 2000). Ingerslev and coworkers (1997) conducted a 6-week study on the effects of a slimming drug on blood pressure. The 136 subjects were normotensive, hypertensives treated with adrenergic -receptor blocking drugs, and hypertensives treated with other antihypertensive agents. Systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly (5.5 mm Hg) in the group given E+C (20mg/200mg) and treated with agents other than -blockers. In the normotensive group given E+C, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced significantly(4.4/3.9 mmHg). In the E+C groups, 45 of 81 patients had side effects including nausea (12%), palpitations (10%), increased perspiration (6%), and  Nutra 1 and Nutra 2 are derived primarily from ma huang. Nutra 3 ephedra is derived from other sources (American Herbal Products Association, 1999).  3  21 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

In the placebo group, 21% reported undesirable effect During the course of a 15-week study comparing dexfenfluramine with 20 mg ephedrine/200 mg caffeine given 3 times a day, 27 of 50 E+C patients complained of side effects, primarily agitation. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced (Breum et al., 1994). Nrregaard and coworkers (1996) administered E+C (60 + 600 mg/day) for 1 year to heavy smokers. A total of 152 received E+C and 73 received placebo. Subjects in the treatment group reported significantly more palpitations, sweating, dizziness, and nausea during the first week but then the differences leveled off; 6 subjects withdrew because of side effects. Six subjects administered ephedrine (75-150 mg), caffeine (150 mg), and aspirin (330 mg) (ECA) for 7-26 months lost weight without significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels (Daly et al., 1993). Supplements of E+C (50 mg/400 mg) given daily for 10 days to 9 obese women were described as having only a weak effect on the cardiovascular system, but addition of yohimbine (10 mg/day) attenuated cardiac performance during rest and handgrip stress and increased cardiac work during dynamic exercise in a second group of 9 obese women (Waluga et al., 1998). The nervousness, psychosis, headache, dizziness, seizures, stroke, premature ventricular contraction, hypertension, myocardial infarction and death described in reports of the adverse effects of ephedra supplements are consistent with the nonselective adrenergic agonist properties of sympathomimetic amines (Boullata & Nace, 2000). Caffeine appears to potentiate these effects. Animal Data on Ephedra Supplements: Acute Studies. LD50 values for various species and routes of administration are available.

Clinical signs of toxicity included tremors, seizures, vomiting, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and nonspecific behavioral changes. Doses of guarana and ma huang at which signs of intoxication were reported ranged between 4.4 and 296 mg/kg bw and 1.3 and 89 mg/kg bw, respectively. Clinical signs developed within 8 hours after ingestion in 80% of the dogs; duration ranged from 10 to 48 hours (Ooms et al., 2001). Subacute Studies of Ephedra Supplements. The safety of a ma huang herbal preparation containing 9% l-ephedrine was addressed in a repeated-dose study in BALB/c mice. Male and female mice (5/sex/dose) were dosed twice a day at 20-4,000 mg/kg for 2 weeks. The highest dose (8,000 mg/kg/day) was lethal to 50% of the animals with gastrointestinal bleeding observed at necropsy. The same toxicity findings to a lesser degree were observed in the 4,000 mg/kg groups; liver weights were not increased. From these data, the LD50 for l-ephedrine in this herbal preparation was determined to be 360 mg/kg twice daily (720 mg/kg/day). Based on body surface area corrections, this corresponds to 2.1 grams twice daily of l-ephedrine and 23.3 grams twice daily of ma huang in a 70 kg human (Law et al., 1996). 23 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

No subchronic or chronic studies of the effects of ephedrine alkaloid extracts in animals were identified in the available literature. Genotoxicity Studies of Ephedra Supplements. Zenedrine RFA-1, a herbal tea containing ephedrine (8.5 mg/ml), pseudoephedrine (3.4 mg/ml), norpseudoephedrine (0.2 mg/ml), and norephedrine (0.2 mg/ml) was tested in the National Cancer Institute Short-Term Test Program (STTP). This material was negative in all five strains of Salmonella in the Ames test. Results from the mouse lymphoma assay are not yet available (Seifried, 2001). Xue-jun and coworkers (1991) reported that Ephedrae sinica Staph extract was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 or TA100 either in the absence or presence of S-9 at doses up to 40 mg/plate. The ephedra extract was also administered intraperitoneally to mice at doses described as equivalent to 1-40 times that used in traditional medicine. No changes in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to total erythrocytes or in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow micronucleus assay were observed. Ephedra herba was screened for mutagenic activity by the rec-assay with Bacillus subtilis as well as the Ames reversion assay with S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation. The ephedra extract was not mutagenic at concentrations up to 100 mg/ml (Morimoto et al., 1982). E. sinica extract inhibited the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene in S. typhimurium TA98 with S-9. However, the extract was an ineffective antitumor agent when administered for 50 weeks in the drinking water of F344/DuCrj male rats that had received benzo[a]pyrene by subcutaneous injection. E. sinica extract also inhibited the mutagenicity of 3,9dinitrofluoranthene and 1,6-dinitropyrene (Horikawa et al., 1994). Decoctions of Ephedra foliata extracts produced nitrosamines when reacted with excess sodium nitrite at conditions found in gastric juice (pH 2, 37EC) (Alwan et al., 1986) 24 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  The cytoxicities of various ma huang extracts on a battery of cell lines could not be totally accounted for by their ephedrine contents, suggesting the presence of other toxins in the extracts (Lee et al., 2000). Animal Data on Ephedrine Acute Studies. NTP (1986) reported an LD50 of 812 mg/kg in male mice and 1,072 mg/kg in female mice of the B6C3F1 strain for ephedrine sulfate administered via gavage. An LD50 was not be determined in F344 rats similarly dosed at 75-1,200 mg/kg because deaths occurred in all dose groups. Subchronic and Chronic Studies. Thirteen-week studies of ephedrine sulfate via feed were conducted by NTP (1986) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Doses were 125-2,000 ppm in rats and 310-5,000 ppm in mice. Hyperactivity and excitability, the most frequent clinical observations, were observed with the greatest incidence in animals receiving ephedrine sulfate at 1,000 ppm or higher. No compound-related histopathological effects were observed. Compound-related reduced weight gain was observed in each sex of both species even though feed consumption by dosed and control animals was comparable. These effects at concentrations of ephedrine sulfate of 500 ppm or higher were considered to be potentially life threatening over the course of a 2-year study. For this reason, the ephedrine sulfate doses selected for the 2-year study were 125 and 250 ppm in feed. Ephedrine sulfate was tested for carcinogenic activity in a 103-week feed study in rats and mice. The compound was administered at 0, 125, or 250 ppm to 50 animals/group/sex. Throughout most of the 2-year study, mean body weights of males and females of both species were lower than those of controls and survival of the chemically exposed female rats (39/50) was greater than survival of controls (27/50). No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed. However, a significant decrease in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas observed in ephedrine sulfate-treated female rats was thought to be associated with reduced weight gain (NTP, 1986, pp. 55-56).  25 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Genotoxicity: Ephedrine sulfate at 100-10,000 g/plate was negative in S. typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535 with or without metabolic activation (NTP, 1986). Ephedrine sulfate was also negative in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells without S-9. With metabolic activation, the test was equivocal for both sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) (NTP, 1986). Ephedrine hydrochloride was tested in the National Cancer Institute Short-Term Test Program (STTP) and was negative in all five strains of Salmonella in the Ames test. Results from the mouse lymphoma assay are not yet available (Seifried, 2001). Metabolism of Ephedrine and Ephedra: Ephedrine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed throughout the body after oral administration, with distribution to the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and brain. Wide interindividual variation in plasma levels has been observed after oral dosing (CANTOX, 2000). In a study by Gurley and coworkers (1998), the absorption and distribution of ephedrine was similar whether it was supplied as ephedra extract in combination with other botanicals or as a single ingredient ephedrine capsule. In contrast, White and coworkers (1997) reported that ephedrine ingested in the form of ma huang had a time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of almost 4 hours, compared with the Tmax for pure ephedrine of 2 hours. The major route of elimination for ephedrine in humans is urinary excretion. Ephedrine is eliminated in the urine largely as unchanged drug, with a half-life of about 3 to 6 hours (McEvoy, 2000). Up to 95% of an oral dose may be excreted in the urine within 24 hours. The urinary excretion of ephedrine is pH-dependent due to the presence of an ionizable group in the ephedrine molecule and is increased in acidic urine. In alkaline urine, excretion is reduced to 20 to 35% of the dose (CANTOX, 2000). The metabolism of ephedrine in humans, dogs and several species of rodents proceeds 27 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  primarily by three reactions; aromatic hydroxylation, N-demethylation, and oxidative deamination. The extent to which ephedrine is metabolized and the major metabolites vary quantitatively between species. The extent of aromatic hydroxylation is greatest in rats, followed by rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs, with no aromatic hydroxylation observed in humans. N-demethylation of ephedrine is greatest in rabbits followed by dogs, guinea pigs, rats, and humans. Deamination is greatest in rabbits, followed by humans and rats (CANTOX, 2000). Ephedrine, 8-20%, is metabolized in humans by N-demethylation to PPA. A total of 413% of an oral dose of ephedrine (CANTOX, 2000). The duration and magnitude of ephedrine activity are known to be affected by antacids and agents which alter the pH of urine thus affecting absorption and excretion, respectively. Ephedrine was not found to affect theophylline clearance (CANTOX, 2000; Upton, 1991). Other Biological Effects Teratogenicity. No information on the teratogenicity of ma huang extracts was found in the available literature. Kanai and coworkers (1986a,1986b) investigated the cardiovascular teratogenicity of ephedrine in pregnant Wistar-Imamichi rats injected ip on days 9,10, or 11 of gestation with single doses of 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of ephedrine. The frequency of cardiovascular abnormalities was dose dependent, ranging from 8.1 to 26.9%, although no significant differences were seen based on day of gestation dosed. All cardiovascular malformations were ventricular septal defects; no extracardiac malformations were observed. Evidence of cardiovascular teratogenicity has also been observed in chick embryos 28 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)  undergoes oxidative deamination yielding 1-  phenylpropan-1,2-diol and further side-chain oxidation to benzoic acid and hippuric acid   Ephedrine alkaloids  (Nishikawa et al., 1985). Placental transfer of ephedrine occurs at 70% of the maternal blood levels. Ephedrine is also excreted in breast milk. No clinical studies have been conducted with ephedrine in pregnant or nursing mothers (CANTOX, 2000). Effects Contributed by Other Ingredients in Ephedrine Alkaloid Supplements: The possibility of effects contributed by other agents should be considered since they are often a major component of herbal preparations at far greater concentrations than the ephedrine alkaloids. These agents include stimulants, diuretics and cathartics, and heart protectors. Stimulants. Guarana: Guarana seed has been used by Rainforest Indian tribes as a stimulant, astringent, and in treating diarrhea and for curing fevers, headaches, and cramps. Guarana seeds contain up to 5% (25,000-75,000 ppm) of guaranine as well as trace amounts of theophylline (500-750 ppm) and theobromine (300-500 ppm). Guarana seeds also contain large quantities of tannins. Guaranine would affect the body in the same manner as caffeine (Blumenthal, 1998; Guarana.com, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c; Raintree.com, 2001; Vitacost.com, 2001). Limited testing of guarana has been conducted. No significant toxicological effects were observed in rats and mice given guarana at 1000-2000 mg/kg (ip and po) and motor activity was not affected. Progress in weight gain was similar to controls in rats administered 0.3 or 3 mg/ml guarana in water/Tween as the only source of liquid for 12 months. Histopathological examination found no alterations in heart, lungs, stomach, small and large intestine, liver, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, or spleen (Mattei et al., 1998). Mice that ingested a guarana suspension at a dose of 0.3 mg/ml had the same average lifespan as controls even after 23 months of treatment (Espinola et al., 1997).  29 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no. N02-CB-07007 (10/01)   Ephedrine alkaloids  Aqueous extracts of guarana did not affect the blood glucose in mice with epinephrineinduced glycogenolysis (Miura et al., 1998). In contrast, aqueous extracts of guarana were genotoxic as assessed by lysogenic induction in Escherichia coli, and this extract also induced frameshift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA97 (da Fonseca et al., 1994). Aqueous guarana extract induced cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster ovary cells and bacterial cells (Photobacterium phosphoreum) causing the authors to conclude that high doses could be harmful to human health (Santa Maria et al., 1998). Caffeine [58-08-3]. Caffeine is pharmacologically similar to the other xanthine drugs, theobromine and theophylline; however, these three agents differ in the intensity of their actions on various structures (McEvoy, 2000). Caffeine causes transient increases in heart rate, force of contraction, cardiac output, and heart work. Caffeine constricts cerebral vasculature but dilates peripheral blood vessels, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. The effect on blood pressure is offset by increased cardiac output. The overall effect of caffeine on heart rate and blood pressure depends on whether CNS or peripheral effects predominate. Adverse CNS effects include insomnia, restlessness, nervousness, and mild delirium. Adverse GI effects include nausea, vomiting, and gastric irritation. It is not known whether caffeine is teratogenic in humans; however, it is teratogenic in rats (McEvoy, 2000). Caffeine has been tested for carcinogenicity in two separate studies in rats: (1) males and female of the Wistar strain, at doses of 0.1 & 0.2% in drinking water for 78 weeks; and (2) males and females of the Sprague-Dawley strain, at doses of 200, 430, 930, 2000 mg/L in drinking water for 2 years. Both studies were negative (CCRIS, 2001). As seen in Table 4, below, clastogenicity and mutagenicity have been demonstrated in some in vitro and animal studies although many other studies are negative.  30 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

The bark contains anthranoids, mainly of the aloe-emodin type, in addition to those of the chrysophanol and physcion type. 1,8Dihydroxyanthracene derivatives have a laxative effect, and cascara sagrada bark is used to treat constipation. German Commission E warns against long-time use/abuse, which may cause disturbances of electrolyte balance, especially potassium deficiency, which can lead to disorders of heart function and muscular weakness (Blumenthal, 1998). Experiments pertaining to the genotoxicity of cascara sagrada and its preparations are not available. Data obtained for aloe-emodin (481-72-1) are outlined in Table 5 below. Table 5.

Hawthorn: Preparations of hawthorn berry have been applied to the treatment of coronary circulation, coronary complications, and weak heart. Preparations of hawthorn flowers have been applied to enhance the activity of myocardium, prevent stress-related heart disease, strengthen the heart and circulatory system, and for coronary insufficiency. Hawthorn leaf preparations have been applied prophylactically to improve the perfusion and nutrition of the myocardium, for simple circulatory disorders of the coronary artery, for diminished cardiac output due to hypertension and pulmonary disease, and for hypotension. According to German Commission E, the effectiveness of hawthorn for the claimed applications has not been documented and there are no scientific data on which 32 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

Willow: White willow bark is considered a natural aspirin. Its salicin derivatives are oxidized in the liver and blood to produce salicylic acid. Average daily dosage corresponds to 60-120 mg total salicin. It has pain-relieving effects like aspirin: typical dosages, up to six 400 mg capsules a day, may be too low to achieve the effect of aspirin (American Herbal Products Association, 2000; Blumenthal, 1998). Both willow bark and aspirin are salicylates, a class of compounds that work by virtue of their salicylic acid content. All salicylates share substantially the same side effects. The major adverse effects include irritation of the gastric mucosa, adverse effects when used during pregnancy (stillbirth, bleeding, prolonged gestation and labor, low birth weigh infants), stroke, and adverse effects in children with fever and dehydration. Approximately 5% of the population is hypersensitive to salicylates ( FDA, 1993).  33 Prepared for NCI by Technical Resources International, Inc. to support chemical nominations under contract no.

SMITH, Administrative Patent Judge, McKELVEY, Senior Administrative Patent Judge, and ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge. ROBINSON, Administrative Patent Judge. DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C.  134 from the final rejection of claims 27 - 36. Claims 19-26 remain pending but are not now subject to rejection or objection. 2  This application was filed on August 4, 1994 under the provisions of 35 U.S.C.  371 as a national stage application of PCT/EP92/02914 which was filed December 16, 1992. Therefore, the present application has an effective filing date of December 16, 1992. (35 U.S.C.  363; 37 CFR  1.495). 1  We find no explicit statement by the examiner indicating that claims 19-26 are allowable. We note the examiner's statement, in the Examiner's Answer (Answer) of September 4, 1996 (Paper No. 17), that ""The statement of the status of claims contained in the brief is correct. (Answer, page 1). Appellants indicate that ""[p]resumably, claims 19-26 therefore will have been found allowable."" Therefore, it is our understanding that these claims are not before us. 2   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Claims 27, 30, 35, and 36 are representative of the subject matter on appeal and read as follows: 27. A transdermal therapeutic application system useful for cancer prophylaxis for applying through the skin of a person, an effective cancer prophylactic amount of an active ingredient consisting essentially of acetyl salicylic acid or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a combination thereof; said transdermal therapeutic application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or is at least greatly reduced; and said substance being selected from the group consisting of dioctyl cyclohexane, dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, glycerol ester of a partially hydrogenated colophonium and dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, and silicone oil. 30. A therapeutic method for preventing cancer in a person, comprising  administering through a transdermal therapeutic application system applied to the skin of said person, an effective cancer prophylactic amount of an active ingredient consisting essentially of acetyl salicylic acid or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a combination thereof; and said transdermal application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or is at least greatly reduced;(sic, .) 35. The therapeutic method of claim 30,  wherein said cancer prophylaxis is against tumor formation. 36. The therapeutic method of claim 35,  wherein said tumor formation prophylaxis is in the gastrointestinal tract.  2   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 There are no references relied upon by the examiner in this appeal.

For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the rejection of claim 27-35, vacate the rejection of claim 36 and enter a new ground of rejection of claims 27-29 under the provisions of 37 CFR  1.196(b). Background Appellants describe the invention at page 5 of the specification as being directed to a transdermal application system for the administration of acetylsalicylic acid or its pharmaceutical salts for antithrombotic therapy and prophylaxis against cancer. The system is described as avoiding the disadvantages associated with oral application and allows for target-specific dosages of the unchanged active substance. Jan. 19, 1999  4   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Discussion The rejection under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph Claims 27-35: As stated in Genentech Inc. v. Nova Nordisk A/S, 108 F.3d 1361, 1366, 42 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1995): Patent protection is granted in return for an enabling disclosure of an invention, not for vague intimations of general ideas that may or may not be workable. See Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 536, 148 USPQ 689, 696 (1966) (stating, in context of the utility requirement, that ""a patent is not a hunting license. It is not a reward for the search, but compensation for its successful conclusion.) When the issue of enablement is raised under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, the initial burden is on the Patent and Trademark Office to establish reasons why one skilled in the art would not believe the objective statements of enablement in the specification. In re Marzocchi, 439 F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA 1971). The examiner urges that (Answer, paragraph bridging pages 2-3): [t]he specification does not reasonably provide enablement for prevention of any and all cancers via transdermal administration of acetyl salicylic acid. The cancer therapy art remains highly unpredictable, and no examples exists for efficacy of a single compound or product against cancer generally. For example, certain cancers/tumors are dependent upon estrogen for their induction or stimulation (e.g. breast tumors) and others are not. Thus, the issue presented in this appeal is whether the appellants' disclosure would have enabled one skilled in this art to use the claimed invention throughout its scope without undue experimentation.  5   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 Factors appropriate for determining whether undue experimentation is required to practice the claimed invention throughout its full scope are listed in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988). These factors include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) the the the the the the the the quantity of experimentation necessary, amount of direction or guidance presented, presence or absence of working examples, nature of the invention, state of the prior art, relative skill of those in the art, predictability or unpredictability of the art, and breadth of the claims.  The examiner's rejection and the reasoning presented in support thereof focus on these factors. At pages 2 and 3 of the Answer, the examiner begins her analysis by interpreting the claims to encompass the use of the transdermal acetylsalicylic acid system for the prevention of cancers generally. The examiner urges that the prevention of cancer in general is a field of endeavor which remains unpredictable. The appellants argue that the examiner has failed to provide prior art documentation to justify the statement that the art area of cancer therapy remains highly unpredictable. However, the examiner's reasoning appears sound (Answer, paragraph bridging pages 2-3) and appellants have offered no meaningful evidence which would indicate that at the time of the filing of this application, the field of endeavor relating to the prevention of cancer, as compared to the treatment of patients with cancer, was not unpredictable. In such situations, it is not necessary to provide extrinsic evidence to establish the relevant factor. See Enzo Biochem. Inc. v. Calgene Inc., 188 F.3d 1362, 1371-72, 6   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 52 USPQ2d 1129, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (""We have also noted that all of the factors need not be reviewed when determining whether a disclosure is enabling."") (citing Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm. Co., Ltd. , 927 F.2d 1200, 1213, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). The examiner, additionally, notes the lack of working examples describing the prevention of any kind of cancer by transdermal delivery of aspirin. (Answer, page 4). Further, the examiner notes that the claims are not limited to a particular type of cancer but are directed to the treatment of ""cancer generally"". (Answer, pages 3 and 4). The examiner concludes that (Answer, page 5): the instant specification does not provide enablement for the prevention of any cancer via the transdermal administration of aspirin, even at the disclosed blood levels. As explained in PPG Indus., Inc. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., 75 F.3d 1558, 1564, 37 USPQ2d 1618, 1623 (Fed. Cir. 1996): The test is not merely quantitative, since a considerable amount of experimentation is permissible, if it is merely routine, or if the specification in question provides a reasonable amount of guidance with respect to the direction in which the experimentation should proceed to enable the determination of how to practice a desired embodiment of the invention claimed. Ex parte Jackson, 217 USPQ 804, 807 (Bd. App. 1982). In the case before us, the examiner has established that the specification is lacking in guidance as to the use or application of the transdermal system for the prevention of cancers generally. Overall, we find that the examiner provides both evidence and sound scientific reasoning in support of her position. We, therefore, find no error in  7   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 the examiner's determination that a prima facie case of unpatentability has been established sufficient to support the rejections of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph. Having met her initial burden, the burden shifts to the appellants to rebut the basis for the rejection. Appellants, initially, argue that the amount of direction or guidance present in the application is adequate for those skilled in this art to practice the invention and cites the article by Thun I, published in 1991, as evidence that aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer and reduce mortality caused by colonic cancer. (Principal Brief, paragraph bridging pages 7-8). However, as appellants acknowledge, the article is limited to the discussion of colon cancer and ""fails to provide further information as to the manner and form of administration and dosage."" (Principal Brief, page 8). Also, as pointed out by the examiner (Answer, page 4): In the article by Thun, it is clearly stated as a conclusion that ""regular aspirin use at low dosages may (emphasis added) reduce the risk of fatal colon cancer. Whether this is due to a direct effect of aspirin . . . or to other factors is unclear."" The results of this one study, are therefore, inconclusive as to the efficacy of aspirin in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, (sic, .) Moreover, however, even if aspirin was shown to be indisputably effective in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, that finding would not be predictive of aspirin preventing any and all cancers in general. Finally, ""reducing the risk"" is not equivalent to ""prevention of"".  8   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 We read Thun I to reflect caution on the part of the authors in describing the potential use of aspirin in the prevention of cancer in stating (page 1323, column 1, first full paragraph): The risk of all fatal cancers combined was somewhat lower among persons who used aspirin than in nonusers; this difference was of borderline statistical significance except in women in the highest category of use. No dose-response trend was seen for all cancers. Thun I, also, states (page 1324, column 1, first paragraph): However, until the findings can be replicated, they should be interpreted cautiously, given the observational nature of our study and the important differences in the biology and epidemiology of these cancers. Thus, appellants' evidence appears to urge caution with respect to the potential usefulness of aspirin in reducing the risk or prevention of cancer in a subject. In addition, the article provides little guidance which would assist those skilled in this art in practicing the presently claimed prevention of cancers in general and would not remove the need for experimentation to obtain the claimed prevention of cancer. Appellants point to page 6, lines 22-25 of the present specification as disclosing that in the prophylaxis against cancer, a therapeutically effective amount of acetyl-salicylic acid and/or acetylsalicylic acid salts in the blood corresponds to blood level values of acetylsalicylic acid of between 0.1 and 1.0 g/ml. (Principal Brief, page 11). The examiner acknowledges this disclosure, but urges that there are no working examples indicating prevention of any kind of cancer by transdermally delivering a sufficient quantity 9   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 of acetylsalicylic acid to provide blood levels between 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml. (Answer, page 4). The appellants have, also, submitted 16 references, listed above, in addition to Thun I, to establish that aspirin has efficacy in the prevention of several different cancers. (Supplemental Reply Brief filed May 19, 1997). We note, initially, that all of these documents were published after the effective filing date of the present application. (December 12, 1992). Thus, they can not be said to represent the state of the art or the skill level of those in this art as of the filing date of this application. They are of little probative value for the proposition asserted by the appellants that the disclosure was sufficient at the time of filing of the application for patent to permit the practice of the invention without undue experimentation. In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1562, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (""[A]ll of these developments occurred after the effective filing date of Wright's application and are of no significance regarding what one skilled in the art believed as of that date.""). The examiner, having reviewed these documents, maintained the position that the evidence may link aspirin to a ""reduction of risk"" of cancer, but urges that this was not equivalent to ""prevention"" as presently claimed. Having weighed all of the evidence of record, including the Wands factors, we find no error in the examiner's determination that the specification does not enable one skilled in this art to use the claimed invention throughout its scope without undue experimentation. Appellants have failed to provided evidence or arguments which, on balance, would be  10   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 sufficient to meet the burden of demonstrating that the disclosure is enabling. The examiner has established a prima facie case of lack of enablement which is sufficient to support the rejections of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, which appellants have not overcome by arguments or convincing evidence. Therefore, the rejection of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is affirmed. Claim 36: We vacate the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, as being based on a non-enabling disclosure for the following reasons. The record with regard to this claim is less than clear. Claim 36 is directed to a therapeutic method wherein the tumor prophylaxis is against tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract. The appellants in their principal Appeal Brief at page 6 state that claims 27-36 are grouped together which is reasonably read as indicating that they stand and fall together. (37 CFR  1.192(7)(1995)). Yet, in the Reply Brief of November 8, 1996 (Paper No. 18) at pages 12, appellants separately argue claim 36 as being limited to the use of aspirin against tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract which reads on the use of aspirin to prevent colon cancer. The examiner acknowledged receipt and entry of the Reply Brief in a letter mailed November 26, 1996 (Paper No. 20),but failed to respond to the newly submitted arguments relating to claim 36. Thus, we are left with no rebuttal to arguments explicitly raised by the appellants and no indication whether these arguments taken with the teaching of the Thun I would reasonably be considered persuasive. In this regard, we note  11   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 the language at page 4 of the Answer where, in discussing the relevance of Thun I, the examiner states that ""even if aspirin was shown to be indisputably effective in reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer, that finding would not be predictive of aspirin preventing any and all cancers in general."" Since ""indisputably effective"" is not the test of whether the disclosure of the application is enabling for that which is claimed, the record is not clear as to the rejection of claim 36. For these reasons, we vacate the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph. On return of the application to the examining group, we would encourage the examiner to step back and consider the evidence of record, including the Thun I reference, and determine whether the facts and evidence would reasonably support the rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, using the factors set forth in Wands, supra. New Ground of Rejection Under the provisions of 37 CFR  1.196(b) we enter the following new ground of rejection. Claims 27-29 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, as failing to find adequate written description in the application as filed for the presently claimed invention. In pertinent part, claim 27 provides: said transdermal therapeutic application system comprising a matrix containing a substance such that hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid is precluded or at least greatly reduced; and said substance being selected from the group consisting of dioctyl cyclohexane, dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane,  12   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 glycerol ester of a partially hydrogenated colophonium and dioctyl cyclohexane dissolved in n-heptane, and silicone oil. This portion of claim 27 was added by amendment filed June 6, 1996 (Paper No. 15) to replace matter previously canceled.3 Appellants indicate at page 2 of that paper, that ""[t]he amendment to claim 27 is to insert the Markush group of substances that preclude or greatly reduce hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid."" We find no written description, in the application as filed, of the members of the Markush group of claim 27 as being substances that preclude or greatly reduce hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid in the transdermal patch. The individual members of this group are named in the examples but there is no explicit statement of their function. We contrast this lack of description of these substances with the explicit statement at page 7 of the specification which states: For reducing or suppressing the hydrolysis, substances may be added such as acylating agents, preferably acetylating agents, and, in particular, acetic anhydride, . . . Further, we compare claim 1 of co-assigned U.S. Patent 5,861,170 to Kissel wherein the members of the Markush group of claim 27 are designated as ""solvents"" rather than as hydrolysis suppressing agents. The members of the Markush group of claim 27 are  Similar terminology was initially added to claim 27 by amendment filed May 25, 1995 (Paper No. 7) in response to the first Office action. In the subsequent final rejection, the examiner rejected the claim as directed to subject matter which lacked antecedent basis in the application as filed for the description of the Markush group of substances as providing hydrophobic adjustments. This terminology was canceled from claim 27, as well as the other claims in which it appeared, by amendment filed April 8, 1996. (Paper No. 11). Claim 27 was subsequently amended at the time of the filing of the Appeal Brief to reintroduce the noted language. (Paper No. 15). While not explicitly stated in the record, the examiner's initials appear on this amendment authorizing entry thereof. Further, the Examiner's Answer, at page 2, indicates that the copy of the claims attached to the Appeal Brief, which included the cited language, was correct. 3  13   Appeal No. 1997-2336 Application No. 08/256,065 individually found in the examples at pages 10-13. In each of these examples, when acetylsalicylic acid is present, the exemplified composition additionally includes acetic anhydride which the specification describes as being the substance useful to preclude or at least reduce the hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid in the transdermal system. Thus, on these facts, the designation of the substances found in the Markush group of claim 27 as substances which preclude or at least greatly reduce hydrolysis lacks written support or antecedent basis in the application as filed. Conclusion The examiner's rejection of claims 27-35 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is affirmed. The rejection of claim 36 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, is vacated. A new ground of rejection under 37 CFR  1.196(b) is entered as to claims 27-29 under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph.

All Rights Reserved.   Purpose The purpose of this monograph is to provide an extensive review of new therapy to determine whether the reviewed drug should be considered a prior authorization drug or not (open access). While prescription expenditures are increasing at double-digit rates, payors are evaluating ways to control these costs by influencing prescriber behavior and guide appropriate medication usage. This review will assist in the achievement o f qualitative and economic goals related to health care resource utilization. Restricting the use of certain medications can reduce costs by requiring documentation of appropriate indications for use, and where appropriate, encourage the use of less expensive agents within a drug class.  Introduction  1,2  On June 24, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for ziprasidone mesylate (Geodon for Injection) to rapidly control agitated behavior and psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Ziprasidone mesylate is the first and only atypical antipsychotic agent approved in the United States for intramuscular (IM) injection.  Dosage Form(s)  2,3  Geodon for Injection is available in a single dose vial as ziprasidone mesylate (20mg ziprasidone/mL when reconstituted according to label instructions) for intramuscular administration. Each mL of ziprasidone mesylate for injection (when reconstituted) affords a colorless to pale pink solution that contains 20mg of ziprasidone and 4.7mg of methanesulfonic acid soulbulized by 294mg of sulfobutylether -cyclodextrin sodium.  Manufacturer  3,4  Pfizer US Pharmaceutical Group 235 East 42nd Street New York, New York, 10017 800-438-1985 http://www.pfizer.com  Indication(s)  3,4  Ziprasidone intramuscular is indicated for the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenic patients for whom treatment with ziprasidone is appropriate and who need intramuscular antipsychotic medication for rapid control of the agitation.  PA Criteria Proposal l 2  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Clinical Efficacy  3,4  The mechanism of action of ziprasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Intramuscular Pharmacokinetics Systemic Bioavailability: The bioavailability of ziprasidone administered intramuscularly is 100%. After intramuscular administration of single doses, peak serum concentrations typically occur at approximately 60 minutes post-dose or earlier and the mean half-life (T) ranges from two to five hours. Exposure increases in a dose-related manner and following three days of intramuscular dosing, little accumulation is observed. Metabolism and Elimination: Although the metabolism and elimination of IM ziprasidone have not been systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways. The results of the intramuscular ziprasidone trials: (1) In a one-day, double-blind, randomized trial (n=79) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 20 mg or 2 mg, up to four times daily, ziprasidone intramuscular 20 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0-4 hours, and by CGI severity at 4 hours and study endpoint. (2) In another one-day, double-blind, randomized trial (n=117) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 10 mg or 2 mg, up to four times daily, ziprasidone intramuscular 10 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0-2 hours, but not by CGI severity.  Contraindications  3,4  QT Prolongation Because of ziprasidone's dose-related prolongation of the QT interval and the known association of fatal arrhythmias with QT prolongation by some other drugs, ziprasidone is contraindicated in patients with a known history of QT prolongation (including congenital long QT syndrome), with recent acute myocardial infarction, or with uncompensated heart failure. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies between ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval have not been performed. An additive effect of ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval cannot be excluded. Therefore, ziprasidone should not be given with:        Dofetilide Class Ia anti-arrhythmics Mesoridazine Pimozide Halofantrine Levomethadyl acetate Arsenic trioxide        Sotalol Class III anti-arrhythmics Thioridazine Sparfloxacin Mefloquine Dolasetron mesylate Tacrolimus        Quinidine Droperidol Chlorpromazine Gatifloxacin Moxifloxacin Pentamidine Probucol  PA Criteria Proposal l 3  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Ziprasidone is also contraindicated with drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects.  Warnings  3,4  QT Prolongation and Risk of Sudden Death Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combinations with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. Additionally, clinicians should be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The management of NMS should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological regimens for NMS. Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increases. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less  PA Criteria Proposal l 4  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do not require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome.  Precautions  3,4  General Rash  In premarketing trials with ziprasidone, about 5% of patients developed rash and/or urticaria with discontinuation of treatment in about one-sixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to the dose of ziprasidone, although the finding might also be explained by the longer exposure time in the higher dose patients. Most patients improved promptly with adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids and/or upon discontinuation of ziprasidone, and all patients experiencing these events were reported to completely recover. Orthostatic Hypotension  Ziprasidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the dose-titration period. Seizures  During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with ziprasidone, although there were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures. Ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, especially in the population of 65 years and older. Hyperprolactinemia  Ziprasidone elevates prolactin levels in humans, as do other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors. Increased prolactin levels were also observed in animal studies with this compound. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Potential for Cognitive or Motor Impairment  Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with ziprasidone. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely. Priapism  One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the event to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with similar effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Body Temperature Regulation - Although not reported with ziprasidone, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents.  PA Criteria Proposal l 5  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to elevation in core body temperature. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness  Clinical experience with ziprasidone with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited.  Adverse Effects  3,4  The most commonly observed adverse events associated with intramuscular ziprasidone (incidence 5% or greater) and observed at a rate on intramuscular ziprasidone (in higher dose groups) at least twice that of the lowest intramuscular ziprasidone group were:  Headache (13%)  Nausea (12%)  Somnolence (20%)  Drug Interactions  3,4  All interaction studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone Pharmacodynamic interactions (combined pharmacological effects): (1) Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval (2) Given the primary CNS effects, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. (3) Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. (4) Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Pharmacokinetic interactions (alteration of plasma levels): Drug/Drug Class The Effect of Other Drugs on Ziprasidone Carbamazepine  Outcome  Ketoconazole  Cimetidine Antacid Benztropine Propranolol Lorazepam Lithium  Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4; administration of 200mg BID for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35% in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered. Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400mg for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmax of ziprasidone by about 25-40%. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects Cimetidine at a dose of 800mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics. The co administration of 30mL of Maalox with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of an clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with the either of these agents. Ziprasidone at a dose of 40mg BID administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450mg BID for 7 days did not affect the steady-state level or renal clearance of lithium.  The Effect of Ziprasidone on Other Drugs  PA Criteria Proposal l 6  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Oral Contraceptives  Dextromethorphan  Ziprasidone at a dose of 20mg BID did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15mg) Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrophan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphan/dextrophan ratio.  In vitro studies revealed little potential for ziprasidone to interfere with the metabolism of drugs cleared primarily by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement. Interactions with Laboratory Tests  Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low potassium and magnesium should be repleted before proceeding with treatment.  Patients who are started on diuretics during ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium.  Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements >500msec.  Dosage and Administration Intramuscular Administration  3,4  The recommended dose is 10 to 20mg administered as required up to a maximum dose of 40mg per day. Doses of 10mg may be administered every two hours; doses of 20mg may be administered every four hours up to a maximum of 40mg/day. Intramuscular administration of ziprasidone for more than three consecutive days has not been studied. If long-term therapy is indicated, oral ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should replace the intramuscular administration as soon as possible. Since there is no experience regarding the safety of administering ziprasidone intramuscular to schizophrenic patients already taking oral ziprasidone, the practice of co-administration is not recommended. Preparation for Administration Geodon for injection (ziprasidone mesylate) should only be administered by intramuscular injection. Single-dose vials require reconstitution prior to administration; any unused portion should be discarded. Add 1.2mL of Sterile W ater for Injection to the vial and shake vigorously until all the drug is dissolved. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 20mg ziprasidone. Since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product, aseptic technique must be  PA Criteria Proposal l 7  2002 Heritage Information Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   used in preparation of the final solution. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents other than Sterile Water for Injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dosing in Special Populations Intramuscular: Ziprasidone intramuscular has not been systematically evaluated in elderly patients or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. As the cyclodextrin excipient is cleared by renal filtration, ziprasidone intramuscular should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function. Dosing adjustments are not required on the basis of gender or race.

It does have a few characteristics that seem to differentiate it from the other agents in its class, such as a low risk of weight gain and a high incidence of QT prolongation on electrocardiogram. However, since one of the limitations of the atypical antipsychotic class was no available parenteral formulation, acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia were given older, typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol). The older antipsychotic agents were effective in these situations, but would frequently cause unpleasant side effects such as dystonias, sedation, and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Since June of 2002, Geodon for injection has been indicated for use in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia - assisting in rapidly controlling the agitated behavior and psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in these patients. The maximum daily dose of Geodon for injection is 40mg per day. The safety of the intramuscular dosing has not been shown beyond three days. Therefore, in order to maintain control, the patient should be switched to oral Geodon.  Recommendation(s) It is recommended that Geodon for Injection (20mg/mL) remain on the prior authorization approval status list  classified as `Clinical Edit' status.

In an initial proposed rule published in the Federal Register on June 4, 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) proposed to amend its regulations to require a warning label on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and mau huang (collectively referred to as ephedra in these comments).  On April 3, 2000, the Agency withdrew the proposed requirements and restrictions.  The Agency now has reopened the comment period, and has requested comments on: (1) A proposed warning label for ephedra-containing products; (2) Whether, in light of more recent evidence, FDA should determine that dietary supplement products present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury; and (3) What additional legislative authorities, if any, would be necessary or appropriate to enable FDA to address this issue more effectively?    Summary of Consumers Union Position   Ephedra's known risks include hypertension, heart attack, irregular heartbeat, stroke, and seizures.  In an article published in Consumer Reports in 1995, Consumers Union was among the first to warn the public about the risks associated with the use of ephedra.  In addition, Consumers Union and ConsumerReports.org repeatedly have called on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the FDA to ban the use of ephedra in dietary supplements.  We believe that the FDA's proposed warning label is an inadequate response to this serious public health hazard and fails to protect consumers from those risks. We believe that based upon information available to Consumers Union, and to the Agency, it is clear that dietary supplements containing ephedra do indeed pose an unreasonable risk of illness or injury and that the Secretary of DHHS Secretary Tommy Thompson should commence with the process to ban ephedra immediately under the powers he currently holds under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994     Secretary Thompson Should Immediately Ban Ephedra   Since 1993, the FDA has received 117 reports of deaths among ephedra users, as well as 16,000 reports of other problems such as strokes, seizures, heatstroke, heart disorders, and psychotic episodes.   As stated in a letter from Consumers Unions President James Guest to Secretary Thompson, dated November 15, 2002, we urge Secretary Thompson to declare dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and mau huang adulterated under Section 402 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (The Act), 21 U.S.C.  342(f)(1)(A)(i) because they [present] a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury and 342(f)(1)(C underconditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling. In addition, we urged the Secretary to initiate proceedings to ban the production and sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra under Section 402 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(f)(1)(C), because they pose an imminent hazard to public health or safety.  In the time interval since Consumers Union sent the above letter, the Agency has failed to act, and more consumers have suffered  and possibly have died from use of ephedra-containing  products.  The February 17, 2003 death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler focused additional attention on ephedra.  As is well known,  Bechler, 23, died of heatstroke after a spring-training practice session.  Several news reports after his death revealed that ephedra supplements were found in his locker.  On March 13, 2002, the Associated Press reported that Broward County, Florida, medical examiner Dr. Joshua Perper stated that toxicology tests disclosed significant amounts of ephedra in his body tissues. The presence of that substance probably contributed to the victims heatstroke and eventual demise.     Recent Evidence from Studies on Ephedra  Alarming evidence about the harmful effects of ephedra have been mounting for years.  We believe there is ample evidence that ephedra poses an unacceptable risk to consumers and provides minimal benefits.  Below is a summary of recent reports and studies illustrating the grave, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal, dangers posed by dietary supplements containing ephedra.    1 Annals of Internal Medicine    A report in the February 2003 Annals of Internal Medicine revealed additional evidence of ephedra-related harms. The study showed that products containing ephedra accounted for 64% of all adverse reactions to herbal products reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 2001.  The researchers calculated that the relative risk for an adverse reaction to ephedra compared with other herbs in the database was 100-fold or more.     2. Journal of the American Medical Association - RAND Report  An article based upon an evaluation of scientific reports conducted by the authors and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center -- RAND, and commissioned by DHHS and NIH, appeared in the March 26, 2003 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.  This report links the use of ephedra with risks of heart, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal problems, while finding insufficient evidence to support its use to enhance athletic performance, or to promote long-term weight loss.   The researchers stated:  We found sufficient evidence to conclude that ephedrine and ephedra are associated with 2 to 3 times the risk of psychiatric symptoms, autonomic symptoms, upper gastroenterological symptoms and heart palpitations.         3. The American Association of Poison Control Centers  The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) has reported a steadily increasing number of serious adverse events related to supplements containing ephedra over the last five years.  Data released in 2002 by the AAPCC indicates that in the year 2001 alone there were 812 reported events relating to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra as a sole ingredient, including 3 deaths, 103 adverse reactions, 10 major effects (defined as exhibiting signs or symptoms that were life-threatening or resulted in significant residual disability) and 139 moderate effects (defined as exhibiting symptoms or signs that were more pronounced, more prolonged or more systemic in nature than minor symptoms -- and where usually some form of treatment is indicated).  Of the 812 exposures, 440 persons (54%) were treated in a health care facility.  Forty-eight percent (48%) of reported exposures occurred in individuals over 19 years of age.  In addition to the above reports there were 7,115 reported events linked to the use of multi-botanical supplements containing ephedra as an ingredient, including three deaths, 1,075 adverse reactions, 87 major effects and 1,325 moderate effects.  Of the 7,115 exposures, 3,849 persons (54%) were treated in a health care facility.  Forty-three percent (43%) of reported exposures occurred in individuals over 19 years of age.   4. Other Studies    Two recent independent studies reported in peer-reviewed journals, scrutinized adverse events reports filed with the FDA between 1995 and 1999.  In the reports, researchers found dozens of cases of abnormal heartbeats, strokes and heart attacks that were likely related to ephedra use.   Samenuk and others at the New England Medical Center in Boston analyzed almost 1,000 cases of possible ephedra toxicity submitted to the FDA.  The researchers reported in the January 2002 issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings that adverse events were clearly related to immediate prior use of the ephedra-containing products in 37 people, and that 36 of these 37 victims had taken the dietary supplement products according to the manufacturers directions.  Sixteen suffered a stroke; 10 had a heart attack; and 11 died.  The study concluded that ma Huang use is temporally related to stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death; (2) underlying heart or vascular disease is not a prerequisite for ma Huangrelated adverse events; and (3) the cardio-vascular toxic effects associated with ma Huang were not limited to massive doses.     In the December 21, 2000 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, Haller and Benowitz from the University of California in San Francisco analyzed 140 cases of alleged ephedra toxicity that were reported to the FDA from 1997 to 1999.  Abnormal heart rhythms, increases in blood pressure, stroke, sudden death, and heart attack led the list.  Of those reactions, 62% were thought to be definitely or probably or possibly due to ephedra.  Eight of the 10 deaths were attributed to ephedra, including that of a 15-year-old girl.      Additional Legislative Authority  DSHEA allowed dietary supplements to receive reduced scrutiny under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.   As the growing number of adverse event reports for ephedra alone illustrates, current law is inadequate to protect consumers from the risks of dietary supplements -- known and unknown.  Although dietary supplement manufacturers are prohibited from making specific disease-cure claims for products, the ability to make a truthful structure-function claim depends upon the biological effects any botanical may have. As such, all dietary supplements making health claims may have potential inherent risks, and therefore should be reviewed for safety prior to marketing.  Efficacy is a separate problem and therefore has to be preceded by the establishment of adequate standards.  Below is a summary of some of the most important legislative changes we believe are necessary protect consumers from harm relating to the use of dietary supplements:  (1) Adverse event reporting by manufacturers of dietary supplement products should be made mandatory.  Under the current system, adverse event reporting is voluntary and creates a conflict of interest on the part of the manufacturer who might be inclined to overlook seemingly marginal risk reporting or simply fail to report adverse effects at all.   Since it is well known that only a small fraction of adverse events are ever reported to any authority, the ever-growing number of ephedra-related events take on even more significance.     (2) FDA must be granted meaningful authority to immediately halt sales of dietary supplement products posing any health risks to consumers.  Since dietary supplement manufacturers are not required to prove efficacy, and claims of benefit are often exaggerated or dubious, any risk of harm to a user should make a given product unacceptable and result in its withdrawal from the market.  The FDA should not have the burden of proving that a supplement is unsafe. Such proof is difficult to achieve since adverse event reporting is always anecdotal. In the case of ephedra that anecdotal evidence is overwhelming.    (3) Ephedra is a natural substance with recognized physiological effects. It belongs to a class of compounds known as pressor amines, all of which cause vasoconstriction and central nervous system stimulation in varying degrees. Tachycardia and euphoria are common effects. When millions of people are exposed to ephedra it should be expected that complications of those side effects (hypertensive episodes, arrhythmias, heart attacks, seizures, and strokes) will occur.  In fact, they can be anticipated. It is therefore within the current power of the FDA to declare ephedra a drug and make it subject to all the regulations pertaining thereto.     Consumers Union requests that Secretary Thompson ban ephedra-containing dietary supplement products under the authority granted by DSHEA.  In addition, we request that the FDA seek any and all additional legislative authority necessary to protect consumers from serious risks associated with dietary supplements, including FDA pre-market review, regulation of suspect dietary supplements as drugs, and mandatory adverse event reporting for all dietary supplements.

In preparation for that meeting, the panel was provided with a draft copy of the RAND report, as well as new publications since the preparation of the report.  The panel was charged to identify avenues of potential research to expand knowledge of the risks and benefits of ephedra.  In that context, the panel addressed four main areas:  the current status of evidence regarding the safety of ephedra; the current status of evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for weight loss; the current status of evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for enhanced athletic performance; and the optimal study design(s) for addressing identified gaps in knowledge regarding both safety and efficacy.       With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the safety of ephedra, the panelists concluded that:        It was clear from the RAND report that the data on safety of ephedra are currently inconclusive.  The available data afford no basis for estimating the balance of risks and benefits of ephedra.  Given the evidence currently available, however, there is no justification for the presumption of safety of ephedra.  It cannot be demonstrated that ephedra is safe, nor can it be demonstrated that ephedra is not safe.      However, while the available data may be inadequate to definitively evaluate the question of safety, they are more than adequate to clearly send a signal of concern, which must be evaluated.  The data from randomized trials are sufficient to indicate that the use of ephedrine or ephedrine with caffeine is associated with 2-3 times the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood, autonomic hyperactivity, and palpitations.  The trials were not of sufficient size to evaluate even in aggregate the possibility of serious side effects that are rare such as death, myocardial infarction, strokes, seizures and psychiatric symptoms.        Information on these serious but rare events was available only from sporadic adverse event reports.  It is important to note the limitations of these data in that they do not have information on denominators, and cannot demonstrate causality.  Of most concern were the ""sentinel"" events, which were based on documentation that:  1) an adverse event had occurred; 2) the subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the event or a toxicological examination showed ephedrine or one of its associated products in the blood or urine; and 3) an adequate investigation had evaluated for and excluded other causes.  A total of 21 sentinel events were identified with prior ephedra consumption:  two deaths, four myocardial infarctions, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases.*  About half of all sentinel events occurred in persons aged 30 years or younger, although this could easily reflect patterns of spontaneous reporting.        To more rigorously evaluate whether consumption of ephedra is causally related to these serious but rare adverse events requires an analytic epidemiologic study design, such as a case-control study.         *The Ephedra Working Group reviewed a draft copy of the RAND report in preparation for the meeting on February 26, 2003.  The final document, released on February 28, 2003, reports a total of 22 sentinel events identified with prior ephedra consumption: two deaths, three myocardial infarctions, nine strokes, three seizures, and five psychiatric cases.          Top      With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for weight loss, the panelists concluded that:            Few trials of ephedra have been conducted.  However, taken together, the evidence suggests that short-term use of ephedrine, ephedrine with caffeine, or dietary supplements containing ephedra with or without caffeine, is associated with short-term weight loss of approximately 2 pounds per month, compared to placebo.  However, panelists with extensive experience evaluating other weight loss agents noted that little is known about how ephedra is used by the public, in terms of factors that could potentiate the success of any dietary supplement, such as concurrent dietary changes, exercise, or counseling.  As a result, the reported studies that included these components are likely overestimating the effects of ephedra as it would be used by consumers, and thus many would not achieve this degree of weight loss with ephedra.          No evidence exists as to the dose-response relationship.          No evidence from controlled trials exists as to whether continued use of ephedra would result in long-term (>6 months) weight loss or weight loss maintenance, or influence clinical health outcomes as distinguished from cardiovascular disease risk factors.             Top       With regard to the current status of the evidence regarding the efficacy of ephedra for athletic performance enhancement, the panelists concluded that:           There are no clinical trials of ephedra for athletic performance enhancement.          There are no clinical trials of chronic use, even of ephedrine, for performance enhancement.  Available trials have assessed effects of acute dosing on very short-term immediate performance (1-2 hours after a single dose) among very fit individuals.          There has been limited replication of the findings with regard to ephedrine, with virtually all reported trials having emanated from a single laboratory.          Virtually all trials of ephedrine have been conducted on a small number of very fit young men (athletes, military recruits), limiting generalizability of the findings.          The available data support a modest effect of ephedrine with caffeine on very short-term indicators of athletic performance enhancement, such as time to exhaustion, increase in performance time, and power output.          In reviewing reported cases of ephedra use, no information was provided on factors such as:  patterns of actual use of ephedra by the general population to enhance athletic performance, including concomitant use of medications such as anabolic steroids; effects of different environmental conditions such as humidity and hydration; effects on blood pressure and arrhythmic effects (observed increase seen in exercise heart rates with ephedrine); effects of thermal stress plus exercise stress; and effects of sustained use on performance over time.         Top       With regard to the next steps in terms of research on ephedra, the panel agreed that a portfolio of research options should be recommended.           The Ephedra Working Group made the clear and strong recommendation that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) must consider dealing with the safety of ephedra as its first priority.  Given that the young represent a vulnerable population in whom assessing risks are of greatest concern,  the panel recommended that the first step of any research portfolio should be a case-control study conducted among adolescents and young adults using ephedra for performance enhancement.  ""Cases"" in various such studies could include ischemic vascular events, and/or cardiovascular events, and/or heat stroke.  Not only would a case-control study be the optimal study design to evaluate these rare events, but the lack of substantial co-morbidity in this group would make it easier to judge the existence of a cause-effect relationship, as compared with the co-morbidities present in obese women using ephedra for weight loss.  While the rigorous scientific design of such a case-control study would involve careful consideration of a number of epidemiologic issues, it would allow the evaluation of the safety of ephedra use among the young in a cost-efficient and timely manner.           While such a case-control study is ongoing, a number of other research avenues to evaluate safety and efficacy could be pursued, which would take varying lengths of time to complete and would concurrently address many of the current gaps in knowledge concerning ephedra. These include:            The initiation of surveys, or the piggy-backing of questionnaires onto ongoing cohort studies, in order to elucidate the current patterns of use of ephedra, including dose and use of concurrent medications, as well as the characteristics of the users.  This would also allow initiation of prospective follow-up of self-reported users.  Such information would provide critical pieces regarding the numerators of events and denominators of use, information that would inform the design of future studies.            The conduct of basic research investigations, including pharmacokinetic drug interaction assessments (including identification of particular vulnerabilities and interactions with agents such as anabolic steroids or sympathomimetics), and experiments that examine physiologic responses under such conditions as exercise and thermal stress.            The conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ephedra for weight loss among overweight and obese women and men.  The first part of this research would consist of a Phase II study, evaluating adverse effects, weight loss, and physiological responses, as well as optimal dosing.  The next step would consist of a randomized clinical trial of adequate sample size to characterize side effects and evaluate efficacy with regard to moderate or long-term weight loss, weight loss maintenance, and relevant health outcomes.  The panelists emphasized that for any clinical trial testing, the study design would have to control for the quality of the active ingredient in the accurate amount, an effort that would require standardizing the products and determining the right dose to be used for testing.                Top     Comments  The panel emphasized that there was not going to be a quick or inexpensive way to answer the ephedra questions of safety and efficacy definitively; that one study could not provide all the answers; and that it would take a portfolio of research approaches.  While the panel members were clearly cognizant that their charge was not to advise on the regulatory aspects of ephedra, but only to identify potential research opportunities to expand knowledge, they felt the situation with ephedra was directly analogous to that seen in the development of any new drug, while recognizing that it is a complex botanical product.  Finally, deciding how to invest precious NCCAM, ODS, and NIH resources in answering public health questions is always a difficult issue.  While evaluating the safety issues of a product being widely used is an overarching priority, the panelists felt a decision to invest a significant portion of NCCAM's research dollars in establishing the efficacy of ephedra and ephedra-containing products as weight loss tools would involve the weighing of competing research priorities.

GX229-50-11351574	"NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE National Institutes of Health  Questions and Answers About Homeopathy Homeopathy (""home-ee-AH-pah-thy""), also known as homeopathic medicine, is a form of health care that developed in Germany and has been practiced in the United States since the early 19th century. Homeopathic practitioners are commonly called homeopaths. This fact sheet answers some frequently asked questions on homeopathy and reviews scientific research on its use and effectiveness. Key Points  In homeopathy, a key premise is that every person has energy called a vital force or selfhealing response. When this energy is disrupted or imbalanced, health problems develop. Homeopathy aims to stimulate the body's own healing responses. Homeopathic treatment involves giving extremely small doses of substances that produce characteristic symptoms of illness in healthy people when given in larger doses. This approach is called ""like cures like."" Various explanations have been proposed as to how homeopathy might work. However, none of these explanations has been scientifically verified. Research studies on homeopathy have been contradictory in their findings. Some analyses have concluded that there is no strong evidence supporting homeopathy as effective for any clinical condition. However, others have found positive effects from homeopathy. The positive effects are not readily explained in scientific terms. It is important to inform all of your health care providers about any therapy that you are currently using or considering, including homeopathic treatment. This is to help ensure a safe and coordinated course of care.         1. What is homeopathy? The term homeopathy comes from the Greek words homeo, meaning similar, and pathos, meaning suffering or disease. Homeopathy is an alternative medical system. Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice, and often have evolved  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183  Page 1   apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States.* Homeopathy takes a different approach from conventional medicine in diagnosing, classifying, and treating medical problems. Key concepts of homeopathy include:   Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's defense mechanisms and processes so as to prevent or treat illness. Treatment involves giving very small doses of substances called remedies that, according to homeopathy, would produce the same or similar symptoms of illness in healthy people if they were given in larger doses. Treatment in homeopathy is individualized (tailored to each person). Homeopathic practitioners select remedies according to a total picture of the patient, including not only symptoms but lifestyle, emotional and mental states, and other factors.    2. What is the history of the discovery and use of homeopathy? In the late 1700s, Samuel Hahnemann, a physician, chemist, and linguist in Germany, proposed a new approach to treating illness. This was at a time when the most common medical treatments were harsh, such as bloodletting, purging, blistering, and the use of sulfur and mercury. At the time, there were few effective medications for treating patients, and knowledge about their effects was limited. Hahnemann was interested in developing a less-threatening approach to medicine. The first major step reportedly was when he was translating an herbal text and read about a treatment (cinchona bark) used to cure malaria. He took some cinchona bark and observed that, as a healthy person, he developed symptoms that were very similar to malaria symptoms. This led Hahnemann to consider that a substance may create symptoms that it can also relieve. This concept is called the ""similia principle"" or ""like cures like."" The similia principle had a prior history in medicine, from Hippocrates in Ancient Greece--who noted, for example, that recurrent vomiting could be treated with an emetic (such as ipecacuanha) that would be expected to make it worse--to folk medicine.14,15 Another way to view ""like cures like"" is that symptoms are part of the body's attempt to heal itself--for example, a fever can develop as a result of an immune response to an infection, and a cough may help to eliminate mucus--and medication may be given to support this self-healing response.  Conventional medicine, as defined by NCCAM, is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. To find out more about these terms, see the NCCAM fact sheet ""What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?""  Items 113 in the references served as general sources for this historical discussion.  Bloodletting was a healing practice used for many centuries. In bloodletting, incisions were made in the body to drain a quantity of blood, in the belief that this would help drain out the ""bad blood"" or sickness. NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183 Page 2  *   Hahnemann tested single, pure substances on himself and, in more dilute forms, on healthy volunteers. He kept meticulous records of his experiments and participants' responses, and he combined these observations with information from clinical practice, the known uses of herbs and other medicinal substances, and toxicology, eventually treating the sick and developing homeopathic clinical practice. Hahnemann added two additional elements to homeopathy:  A concept that became ""potentization,"" which holds that systematically diluting a substance, with vigorous shaking at each step of dilution, makes the remedy more, not less, effective by extracting the vital essence of the substance. If dilution continues to a point where the substance's molecules are gone, homeopathy holds that the ""memory"" of them--that is, the effects they exerted on the surrounding water molecules--may still be therapeutic. A concept that treatment should be selected based upon a total picture of an individual and his symptoms, not solely upon symptoms of a disease. Homeopaths evaluate not only a person's physical symptoms but her emotions, mental states, lifestyle, nutrition, and other aspects. In homeopathy, different people with the same symptoms may receive different homeopathic remedies.    Hans Burch Gram, a Boston-born doctor, studied homeopathy in Europe and introduced it into the United States in 1825. European immigrants trained in homeopathy also made the treatment increasingly available in America. In 1835, the first homeopathic medical college was established in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By the turn of the 20th century, 8 percent of all American medical practitioners were homeopaths, and there were 20 homeopathic medical colleges and more than 100 homeopathic hospitals in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous medical advances were made, such as the recognition of the mechanisms of disease; Pasteur's germ theory; the development of antiseptic techniques; and the discovery of ether anesthesia. In addition, a report (the so-called ""Flexner Report"") was released that triggered major changes in American medical education. Homeopathy was among the disciplines negatively affected by these developments. Most homeopathic medical schools closed down, and by the 1930s others had converted to conventional medical schools. In the 1960s, homeopathy's popularity began to revive in the United States. According to a 1999 survey of Americans and their health, over 6 million Americans had used homeopathy in the preceding 12 months.16 The World Health Organization noted in 1994 that homeopathy had been integrated into the national health care systems of numerous countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.7 Several schools of practice exist within homeopathy.17 Persons using homeopathy do so to address a range of health concerns, from wellness and prevention to treatment of injuries, diseases, and conditions. Studies have found that many people who seek homeopathic care seek it for help with a chronic medical condition.18,19,20   Toxicology is the science of the effects of chemicals on human health.

What kind of training do homeopathic practitioners receive? In European countries, training in homeopathy is usually pursued either as a primary professional degree completed over 3 to 6 years or as postgraduate training for doctors.14 In the United States, training in homeopathy is offered through diploma programs, certificate programs, short courses, and correspondence courses. Also, homeopathic training is part of medical education in naturopathy.** Most homeopathy in the United States is practiced along with another health care practice for which the practitioner is licensed, such as conventional medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, acupuncture, or veterinary medicine (homeopathy is used to treat animals). Laws about what is required to practice homeopathy vary among states. Three states (Connecticut, Arizona, and Nevada) license medical doctors specifically for homeopathy. 4. What do homeopathic practitioners do in treating patients? Typically, in homeopathy, patients have a lengthy first visit, during which the provider takes an in-depth assessment of the patient. This is used to guide the selection of one or more homeopathic remedies. During followup visits, patients report how they are responding to the remedy or remedies, which helps the practitioner make decisions about further treatment. 5. What are homeopathic remedies? Most homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals. A remedy is prepared by diluting the substance in a series of steps (as discussed in Question 2). Homeopathy asserts that this process can maintain a substance's healing properties regardless of how many times it has been diluted. Many homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted that not one molecule of the original natural substance remains.12,21 Remedies are sold in liquid, pellet, and tablet forms. 6. How does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate homeopathic remedies? Because of their long use in the United States, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 1938 declaring that homeopathic remedies are to be regulated by the FDA in the same manner as nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, which means that they can be purchased without a physician's prescription. Today, although conventional prescription drugs and new OTC drugs must undergo thorough testing and review by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before they can be sold, this requirement does not apply to homeopathic remedies. **  Naturopathy, also known as naturopathic medicine, is an alternative medical system that emphasizes natural healing approaches (such as herbs, nutrition, and movement or manipulation of the body). Some elements of naturopathy are similar to homeopathy, such as an intent to support the body's own self-healing response. Page 4  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183   Remedies are required to meet certain legal standards for strength, quality, purity, and packaging. In 1988, the FDA required that all homeopathic remedies list the indications for their use (i.e., the medical problems to be treated) on the label.22,23 The FDA also requires the label to list ingredients, dilutions, and instructions for safe use. The guidelines for homeopathic remedies are found in an official guide, the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which is authored by a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization of industry representatives and homeopathic experts.24 The Pharmacopoeia also includes provisions for testing new remedies and verifying their clinical effectiveness. Remedies on the market before 1962 have been accepted into the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States based on historical use, rather than scientific evidence from clinical trials. 7. Have any side effects or complications been reported from the use of homeopathy? The FDA has learned of a few reports of illness associated with the use of homeopathic remedies. However, the FDA reviewed these reports and decided that the remedies were not likely to be the cause, because of the high dilutions.3 Here is some general information that has been reported about risks and side effects in homeopathy:   Homeopathic medicines in high dilutions, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are considered safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions.25 Some patients report feeling worse for a brief period of time after starting homeopathic remedies. Homeopaths interpret this as the body temporarily stimulating symptoms while it makes an effort to restore health. Liquid homeopathic remedies can contain alcohol and are permitted to have higher levels of alcohol than conventional drugs for adults. This may be of concern to some consumers. However, no adverse effects from the alcohol levels have been reported either to the FDA or in the scientific literature.3 Homeopathic remedies are not known to interfere with conventional drugs; however, if you are considering using homeopathic remedies, you should discuss this with your health care provider. If you have more than one provider, discuss it with each one.      As with all medicinal products, a person taking a homeopathic remedy is best advised to:    Contact his health care provider if his symptoms continue unimproved for more than 5 days. Keep the remedy out of the reach of children. Consult a health care provider before using the product if the user is a woman who is pregnant or nursing a baby.  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub.

This section summarizes results from (1) individual clinical trials (research studies in people) and (2) broad analyses of groups of clinical trials. The results of individual, controlled clinical trials of homeopathy have been contradictory. In some trials, homeopathy appeared to be no more helpful than a placebo; in other studies, some benefits were seen that the researchers believed were greater than one would expect from a placebo. Appendix I details findings from clinical trials. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses take a broader look at collections of a set of results from clinical trials. Recent examples of these types of analyses are detailed in Appendix II. In sum, systematic reviews have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition. Two groups of authors listed in Appendix II found some positive evidence in the groups of studies they examined, and they did not find this evidence to be explainable completely as placebo effects (a third group found 1 out of 16 trials to have some added effect relative to placebo). Each author or group of authors criticized the quality of evidence in the studies. Examples of problems they noted include weaknesses in design and/or reporting, choice of measuring techniques, small numbers of participants, and difficulties in replicating results. A common theme in the reviews of homeopathy trials is that because of these problems and others, it is difficult or impossible to draw firm conclusions about whether homeopathy is effective for any single clinical condition. 9. Are there scientific controversies associated with homeopathy? Yes. Homeopathy is an area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that has seen high levels of controversy and debate, largely because a number of its key concepts do not follow the laws of science (particularly chemistry and physics).   It is debated how something that causes illness might also cure it. It has been questioned whether a remedy with a very tiny amount (perhaps not even one molecule) of active ingredient could have a biological effect, beneficial or otherwise. There have been some research studies published on the use of ultra-high dilutions (UHDs) of substances, diluted to levels compatible with those in homeopathy and shaken hard at each step of dilution. The results are claimed to involve phenomena at the molecular level and beyond, such as the structure of water, and waves and fields. Both laboratory  A placebo is designed to resemble as much as possible the treatment being studied in a clinical trial, except that the placebo is inactive. An example of a placebo is a pill containing sugar instead of the drug or other substance being studied. By giving one group of participants a placebo and the other group the active treatment, the researchers can compare how the two groups respond and get a truer picture of the active treatment's effects. In recent years, the definition of placebo has been expanded to include other things that could have an effect on the results of health care, such as how a patient and a health care provider interact, how a patient feels about receiving the care, and what he or she expects to happen from the care.  In a systematic review, data from a set of studies on a particular question or topic are collected, analyzed, and critically reviewed. A meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to analyze results from individual studies.  For some examples, see references 2629. NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183 Page 6     research and clinical trials have been published. There have been mixed results in attempts to replicate them. Reviews have not found UHD results to be definitive or compelling.*** There have been some studies that found effects of UHDs on isolated organs, plants, and animals.15 There have been controversy and debate about these findings as well.   Effects in homeopathy might be due to the placebo or other non-specific effect. There are key questions about homeopathy that are yet to be subjected to studies that are well-designed--such as whether it actually works for some of the diseases or medical conditions for which it is used, and if so, how it might work. There is a point of view that homeopathy does work, but that modern scientific methods have not yet explained why. The failure of science to provide full explanations for all treatments is not unique to homeopathy. Some people feel that if homeopathy appears to be helpful and safe, then scientifically valid explanations or proofs of this alternative system of medicine are not necessary.      10. Is NCCAM funding research on homeopathy? Yes. Current National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)supported research projects are studying:    Homeopathy for physical, mental, and emotional symptoms of fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder involving widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points on the body, and fatigue). Homeopathy for brain deterioration and damage in animal models for stroke and dementia. The homeopathic remedy cadmium, to find out whether it can prevent damage to the cells of the prostate when those cells are exposed to toxins.

Clinical Trials on Homeopathy Published from 1998 to 2002 Citation Vickers and Smith, 2002 34  Description Seven trials were included in the review (three prevention and four treatment trials); only two studies had sufficient information for complete data extraction. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 242 participants aged 18 to 55 years.  Findings The homeopathic remedy oscillococcinum appears safe and effective in reducing the duration of influenza, but has no effect on prevention. Trial compared an oral homeopathic treatment to placebo in asthmatic people allergic to house dust. Authors found the homeopathic treatment ""no better than placebo."" They noted ""some differences between the homeopathic immunotherapy and placebo for which we have no explanation."" Traumeel S, a homeopathic skin cream, may significantly reduce the severity and length of pain and inflammation of the tissues lining the inside of the mouth from chemotherapy in children being treated with bone marrow transplantation. Team tested the hypothesis that homeopathy is a placebo by examining effects of an oral homeopathic preparation in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. They found a ""significant objective improvement in nasal airflow"" compared with the placebo group. However, both groups reported subjective improvement in ""nasal symptoms"" (with no statistically significant difference between groups). Authors concluded that the objective evidence supports that ""homeopathic dilutions differ from placebo."" Individualized homeopathic treatments improved digestive problems in children with acute childhood diarrhea. Results are consistent with findings of a previous study.  Lewith et al., 2002  28  Oberbaum et al., 200135  Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 32 children; 30 completed the study.

Jacobs et al., 200037  Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 126 children; 116 completed the study.  Due to the large number of trials, these studies have been selected to give a representative overview of the findings published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals in English and indexed in the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database.

For the treatment of hay fever, a homeopathic nasal spray is as efficient and well tolerated as a conventional therapy, cromolyn sodium. A subgroup of patients with HIV in the symptomatic phase, receiving treatment, had increased levels of CD4 cells at the end of the trial; the placebo subgroup did not. Homeopathic remedies, including arnica, are not effective for muscle soreness following long-distance running. The homeopathic treatment vertigoheel, and the standard treatment of betahistine, are equally effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of vertigo attacks.

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Clinical Trials of Homeopathy Citation Ernst, 2002 33    Description Analyzed 17 systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) of controlled clinical trials for homeopathy.  Findings Author found that the reviews failed to provide strong evidence in favor of homeopathy. No homeopathic remedy was proven by convincing evidence to yield clinical effects that are different from placebo or from other control intervention for any medical condition. Positive recommendations for use of homeopathy in clinical practice are not supported, and ""homeopathy cannot be viewed as an evidence-based form of therapy"" until more convincing results are available. Authors found that the majority of trials had major weaknesses in methodology and/or reporting. Homeopathy trials were ""less frequently randomized...and reported less details on dropouts and withdrawals"" than the other types. Authors found that the ""strength of evidence remains low"" because of trial flaws and other limitations. They added that ""at least one [of the tested homeopathic treatments] shows an added effect relative to placebo."" Group recommended that homeopathy be studied further using the same methods used to study conventional medicine. Rigorous clinical trials indicate arnica is not more effective than a placebo; most trials studied use of arnica for tissue trauma. Authors concluded that their results were not compatible with a hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy are completely due to placebo. However, they found insufficient evidence that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. They stated that further research is warranted if it is rigorous and systematic.  Linde et al., 200142  Analyzed the methodological quality of 207 randomized trials collected for 5 previously published reviews on homeopathy, two herbal medicines (St. John's wort and echinacea), and acupuncture. Analyzed 16 randomized, controlled trials (17 comparisons were made) comparing homeopathic treatment to placebo. Work was part of a report prepared for the European Union on the effectiveness of homeopathy. 43  Cucherat et al., 200017  Ernst and Pittler, 1998  Systematic review of eight trials.  Linde et al., 19976  Analyzed 89 trials. Each trial was controlled; compared homeopathy to a placebo; was either randomized or doubleblinded; and yielded a written report.    Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are defined on page 6. Page 13  NCCAM Clearinghouse Pub. No. D183   Kleijnen et al., 1991  21  Assessed 105 controlled trials of homeopathy, 68 randomized.  Authors found a positive trend in the evidence, regardless of the quality of the trial or the method of homeopathy used. They cautioned, however, that definitive conclusions about homeopathy could not be drawn, because many of the trials were not of good quality and the role of publication bias was unknown.  Long and Ernst, 2001  44  Systematic Reviews of Clinical Trials on Single Medical Conditions Systematic review of four osteoarthritis clinical trials. Research on homeopathic treatment for osteoarthritis is insufficient to reliably assess the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis. Controlled clinical trials indicate that homeopathic remedies appear to work better than a placebo in studies of rheumatic syndromes, but there are too few studies to draw definitive conclusions, and efficacy results are mixed.

FDA is issuing this final rule  after considering public comments on its proposed regulation, issued as  a tentative final monograph (TFM), and all new data and information on  antiperspirant drug products that have come to the agency's attention.  DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 9, 2004.     Compliance Dates: The compliance date for products with annual  sales less than $25,000 is June 9, 2005. The compliance date for all  other products is December 9, 2004.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald M.

Background      In the Federal Register of October 10, 1978 (43 FR 46694), FDA  published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a  monograph for OTC antiperspirant drug products, together with the  recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antiperspirant Drug  Products (the Panel), which evaluated the data on these products. The  agency's proposed regulation (TFM) for OTC antiperspirant drug products  was published in the Federal Register of August 20, 1982 (47 FR 36492).     In the Federal Register of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the  agency issued a final rule establishing that certain active ingredients  in OTC drug products are not generally recognized as safe and effective  and are misbranded. These ingredients included seven antiperspirant  ingredients, which are included in Sec.  310.545(a)(4) (21 CFR  310.545(a)(4)). In this rulemaking, the agency is adding one additional  ingredient to this section. (See section III.1 of this document.)     In the Federal Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452), the agency  requested public comment on two citizen petitions, and a response to  one of the petitions, related to the safety of aluminum compounds in  OTC antiperspirant drug products. This final monograph completes the  TFM and provides the substantive response to the citizen petitions.     Twenty-four months after the date of publication in the Federal  Register, for products with annual sales less than $25,000, and 18  months after the date of publication in the Federal Register, for all  other products, no OTC drug product that is subject to this final rule  and that contains a nonmonograph condition may be initially introduced  or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless  it is the subject of an approved new drug application (NDA) or  abbreviated new drug application. Further, any OTC drug product subject  to this final monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the  compliance dates of the final rule must be in compliance with the  monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced  or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.  Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily as soon as possible.     In response to the TFM on OTC antiperspirant drug products and the  request for comment on the citizen petitions, the agency received 20  comments. One manufacturer requested an oral hearing before the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs on six different issues. Copies of the  information considered by the Panel, the comments, and the hearing  request are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061,  Rockville, MD 20852. ``OTC Volumes'' cited in this document refer to  information on public display.     The agency received some ``feedback'' communications under the OTC  drug review procedures (see the Federal Registers of September 29, 1981  (46 FR 47740) and April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050)). The agency has included  these communications in the administrative record and addressed them in  this document.     The safety issues raised by the citizen petitions are discussed in  section II.F of this document. The agency believes it has adequately  responded to the six issues related to the hearing request; therefore,  a hearing is not necessary.  II. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments  A. General Comments on OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products      (Comment 1) One comment requested that FDA reconsider its position  that OTC drug monographs are substantive, as opposed to interpretive,  regulations.     The agency addressed this issue and reaffirms its conclusions as  stated in  [[Page 34274]]  paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for  classification of OTC drug products (May 11, 1972, 37 FR 9464 at 9471  to 9472) and in paragraph 1 of the preamble to the TFM in the present  proceeding (47 FR 36492 at 36493).     (Comment 2) Three comments disagreed with the agency's proposed  definition of an antiperspirant: ``A drug product that, when applied  topically to the underarm, will reduce the production of perspiration  (sweat) at that site,'' (47 FR 36492 at 36503). One comment contended  it was unduly restrictive and unnecessary to limit use only in the  underarm area because it is not the only area of the body upon which  these products could potentially be applied. The comment asked the  agency to modify the definition to parallel the pharmacologic activity  of the active ingredients and suggested: ``A drug product that, when  applied topically, will reduce the production of perspiration (sweat)  at that site.''     A second comment stated that the definition limiting use to the  underarm only would adversely affect its products labeled for use on  the hands and for use with orthotic and prosthetic appliances (to keep  appliance-skin contact areas dry). Noting that the agency and the Panel  recognized the similarities and differences between axillary and foot  perspiration, a third comment stated that ingredients effective in the  underarm area are probably effective to control foot perspiration.     The agency agrees with the first comment that it is not necessary  to specify the area of use on the body in the definition of an  antiperspirant because that information is included in the product's  labeling. Accordingly, the agency is deleting the phrase ``to the  underarm'' from the definition of an antiperspirant in Sec.  350.3 (21  CFR 350.3) of this final monograph to read: ``Antiperspirant. A drug  product applied topically that reduces the production of perspiration  (sweat) at that site.'' The use of an antiperspirant on other areas of  the body, as mentioned by the second and third comments, is discussed  in section II.A, comment no. 4 and section II.C, comment 14 of this  document.     (Comment 3) One comment stated that the TFM for OTC antiperspirant  drug products was substantively and procedurally defective because it  failed to address adequately the Panel's Category III recommendations  concerning ``enhanced duration of effect'' and ``problem perspiration''  and failed to state what testing was required to substantiate these  claims. The comment requested that FDA issue a new or amended TFM to  address these issues.     The agency has determined that there is no need to withdraw, amend,  or initiate a new TFM. Since the Panel's report was published in 1978,  the procedural regulations for the OTC drug review were revised to  comply with the Court ruling in Cutler v. Kennedy, 475 F. Supp. 838  (D.D.C. 1979). The revised regulations (46 FR 47730, September 29,  1981) provide that TFMs and final monographs will no longer contain  recommended testing guidelines. The agency is not required by statute  or regulation to include testing guidelines as part of OTC panel  reports or TFMs. The agency stated in proposed Sec.  350.60 of the TFM  (47 FR 36492 at 36504) and states in Sec.  350.60 of this final  monograph (21 CFR 350.60) that ``To assure the effectiveness of an  antiperspirant, the Food and Drug Administration is providing  guidelines that manufacturers may (emphasis added) use in testing for  effectiveness.''     The ``enhanced duration of effect'' and the ``problem  perspiration'' issues are discussed in section II.C, comments 10 and 12  of this document. Extended duration of effect claims have been placed  in Category I based on data submitted by other comments (see also  comment 12). The agency has determined that claims for problem  perspiration are outside the scope of this monograph because no data  were submitted to support such claims (see also comment 10).     (Comment 4) One comment contended that the proposed monograph would  have a disastrous economic effect on its company, which markets an  antiperspirant product first formulated in 1902 and labeled for  excessive perspiration, including keeping the hands free of  perspiration (labeled for use on the hands for tennis, racquetball,  bowling, football, and other sporting uses), and marketed for  prosthesis and orthotic use (for amputees to keep their appliance  contact areas dry).     To qualify for exemption from the ``new drug'' definition under the  1938 grandfather clause of the act, the drug product must have been  subject to the Food and Drug Act of 1906, prior to June 25, 1938, and  at such time its labeling must have contained the same representations  concerning the conditions of its use (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(1)). Under the  1962 grandfather clause of the act, a drug product which on October 9,  1962 was: (1) Commercially used or sold in the United States; (2) not a  ``new drug'' as defined in the 1938 act; and (3) not covered by an  effective NDA under the 1938 act, would not be subject to the added  requirement of effectiveness ``when intended solely for use under  conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with  respect to such drug on that day.'' (Public Law 87-781, section  107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 788, note following 21 U.S.C. 321).     The person seeking to show that a drug comes within a grandfather  exemption must prove every essential fact necessary for invocation of  the exemption. See United States v. An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex  Ulcerine,'' 469 F.2d 875, 878 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S.  938 (1973). Furthermore, the grandfather clause will be strictly  construed against one who invokes it. See id.; United States v. Allan  Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899  (1966). A change in composition or labeling precludes the applicability  of the grandfather exemption. See USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v.  Weinberger, 412 U.S. 655, 663 (1973).     Although the comment stated that its drug products have been  marketed since 1902 with hand perspiration labeling claims, no evidence  was submitted to show that the labeling and composition of the products  have remained unchanged since either 1938 or 1962, so that they qualify  as grandfathered products. The agency requested product labeling from  these years on several occasions (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), but none was ever  provided. Without such evidence, the products do not qualify for either  grandfather exemption. The burden of proof with respect to the  grandfather exemption is not on FDA, but on the person seeking the  exemption. See An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,'' supra.     The 1938 and 1962 grandfather clauses apply only to the new drug  provisions of the act (see 21 CFR 314.200(e)) and not to the  adulteration and misbranding provisions. The OTC drug review was  designed to implement both the misbranding and the new drug provisions  of the act. (See Sec.  330.10 (21 CFR 330.10), 37 FR 9464 at 9466.) The  grandfather clauses do not preclude the agency from reviewing any  currently marketed OTC drug product, regardless of whether it has  grandfather protection from the new drug provisions, in order to ensure  that it is not misbranded.     Although the comment claimed this final rule would have a  disastrous economic effect on its company if antiperspirants can be  labeled only for underarm use, it provided no documentation about this  impact. The agency notes that while the company's products would need  to be relabeled to bear different indications, as long as the monograph  conditions are met, the  [[Page 34275]]  products could remain in the marketplace after relabeling occurred. The  economic impact of this final rule is discussed in section VI of this  document.  B. General Comments on Labeling of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products      (Comment 5) Several comments contended that FDA should not  incorporate the ``exclusivity policy'' in the final monograph by  prescribing specific labeling terminology to the exclusion of other  truthful nonmisleading language.     After these comments were submitted, in the Federal Registers of  May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258) and March 17, 1999 (64 FR 13254), the agency  published final rules changing its labeling policy for stating the  indications for use of OTC drug products. Under Sec.  330.1(c)(2) (21  CFR 330.1(c)(2)), the agency provides options for labeling OTC drug  products. The final monograph in this document is subject to the  labeling provisions in Sec.  330.1(c)(2). In addition, the monograph  labeling follows the format and content requirements of Sec.  201.66  (21 CFR 201.66).     (Comment 6) One comment objected to limiting the terms proposed in  Sec.  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to ``reduces,'' ``decreases,''  ``diminishes,'' and ``lessens.'' The comment stated that ``lower'' and  ``mitigate'' are synonyms for ``reduce'' and other words and phrases  state, truthfully and accurately, the effect of antiperspirants.     Several comments disagreed with the agency that words such as  ``stop,'' ``check,'' ``halt,'' ``end,'' ``eliminate,'' and ``protect''  should not be used in the labeling of antiperspirant drug products,  even if preceded by the word ``helps,'' because these words imply the  ability to stop underarm perspiration totally and would therefore  mislead the consumer about the effectiveness of antiperspirant drug  products. The comments mentioned the minority Panel position that ``The  Panel did not see scientific data to indicate that a consumer can  differentiate between such words as `halts,' `checks,' `stops,' and  `ends,' as disallowable words versus `diminishes' and `reduces' as  allowable words,'' (43 FR 46694 at 46725). One comment agreed with the  minority because a review of the entire record of this proceeding found  no studies or data to support a decision to disallow ``protects,''  ``halts,'' ``checks,'' and ``stops.'' Another comment requested a  hearing on this issue.     One comment disagreed with the Panel's Category II status for the  following labeling claims (43 FR 46694 at 46724): ``Dry,'' ``dry  formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``helps stop wetness,'' ``completely guards  your family,'' ``helps stop embarrassing perspiration wetness,''  ``complete protection,'' ``really helps keep you dry,'' and ``gentle  enough for sensitive areas of the body.'' The comment asked the agency  to allow these claims in the final monograph.     The agency has re-evaluated these claims in light of the comments'  arguments and its current policy to provide consumer friendly OTC drug  product labeling. The agency is deleting one previously proposed word  (``diminishes'') and adding some more consumer-friendly words  (``sweat'' and ``sweating'') to antiperspirant product labeling.     The agency proposed the word ``diminishes'' in Sec.  350.50(b) as  one of the optional terms that could be used as the first word of the  indications statement. While the word ``diminish'' means to ``reduce,''  the agency does not consider it as consumer-friendly as the other  optional words ``reduces,'' ``decreases,'' or ``lessens.'' Therefore,  the agency is not including ``diminishes'' in Sec.  350.50(b) of this  final monograph as an FDA-approved term. The agency rejected the words  ``mitigate'' and ``lower'' in the TFM (comment 14, 47 FR 36492 at 36496  to 36497). The agency's position has not changed. While the terms  ``mitigate,'' ``lower,'' and ``diminishes'' are not in the monograph  and the agency does not favor their use, manufacturers may use these  terms, or other words or phrases that truthfully and accurately express  a similar meaning, under the flexible labeling policy in Sec.   330.1(c)(2).     The agency is not changing its position on the use of the word  ``helps'' in conjunction with the words ``stop,'' ``halt,'' ``check,''  ``end,'' and ``eliminate.'' In the TFM (comment 14), the agency stated  that these words imply the ability to stop underarm perspiration  totally and would therefore mislead consumers about antiperspirant  effectiveness. Although neither the Panel nor the agency had any  consumer comprehension studies to support a decision to disallow this  information, the comments also did not provide any data to support  these terms. The agency would consider these terms if data are provided  to show that consumers would not be misled about the effect of  antiperspirant drug products. The agency is not including ``helps  protect'' before ``underarm dampness,'' ``underarm perspiration,'' or  ``underarm wetness,'' because the language is not clear and could  confuse consumers.     The agency is not including any ``dry'' or similar claims (``dry,''  ``dry formula,'' ``super dry,'' ``really helps keep you dry'') in this  final monograph because no criteria have been established to define  ``dry.'' Thus, what may be ``dry'' for one manufacturer's product may  not be ``dry'' for another manufacturer's product. The agency would  consider including ``dry'' claims in the monograph if appropriate  criteria for such claims are developed.     The agency is not including claims such as ``complete protection''  or ``completely guards your family'' in the monograph because there is  no evidence that antiperspirant drug products provide ``complete''  protection. The agency is not including the claim ``gentle enough for  sensitive areas of the body'' because the words ``sensitive areas'' may  imply that the product can be used on other body areas in addition to  the underarm. The agency is not including the claim ``helps stop  embarrassing perspiration wetness'' because what is ``embarrassing'' or  ``problem'' perspiration for one individual may not be ``embarrassing''  or a ``problem'' for others. (See section II.C, comment 10 of this  document.)     The agency is not including both ``perspiration'' and ``wetness''  in the same claim because it considers the duplicative wording  unnecessary. The currently allowed claims are ``* * * underarm  wetness'' or ``* * * underarm perspiration.'' The agency would have no  objection to ``* * * underarm perspiration wetness,'' but such would  have to be done under the flexible labeling provisions of Sec.   330.1(c)(2). The agency is adding the words ``sweat'' and ``sweating''  in Sec.  350.50(b) as other ways to describe ``wetness'' and  ``perspiration,'' because consumers regularly use these terms to  describe perspiration. Based on the previous discussion, the agency  concludes that a hearing is not warranted on these issues.     (Comment 7) Three comments requested that OTC antiperspirant drug  products be exempted from the keep out of reach of children and  accidental ingestion warnings in Sec.  330.1(g) because these products  are not toxic by oral ingestion. One comment noted only one reported  ingestion in 30 years of marketing antiperspirant products. Another  comment stated that aerosols, in particular, should be exempt from the  ingestion warning due to the characteristics of the delivery system and  the warnings already required for aerosols pressurized by gaseous  propellants under Sec.  369.21 (21 CFR 369.21).     Although the comments did not submit any data to show that  antiperspirant drug products are safe if ingested, the agency believes  these products should not be toxic by oral  [[Page 34276]]  ingestion for most individuals. However, individuals with renal  dysfunction or immature renal function (i.e., infants) are at a higher  risk from any exposure to aluminum. Further, ingestion of the various  inactive ingredients present in these products may make young children  ill or cause other undesirable consequences. Without adequate proof of  safety if accidental ingestion were to occur, the agency has no basis  to exempt OTC antiperspirant drug products from the accidental  ingestion warning.     Although aerosol antiperspirant drug products are unlikely to be  accidentally ingested by most consumers, the agency notes that the  product containers are similar to those used for some food products.  Spraying an aerosol into the mouth and ingesting it could be more  hazardous than ingesting other dosage forms of the product because of  the aerosol propellants. The warnings required under Sec.  369.21, for  those drugs in dispensers pressurized by gaseous propellants, are not  related to ingestion, but state the following: ``Avoid spraying in the  eyes. Do not puncture or incinerate. Do not store at temperatures above  120 [deg]F. Keep out of reach of children.'' The agency does not  consider these warnings a basis to exempt aerosol antiperspirants from  the accidental ingestion warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) for topical  drug products. The last statement of the warning required by Sec.   369.21 and the first warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) (i.e., ``Keep  out of reach of children.'') are identical as of March 17, 1999 (64 FR  13254 at 13294). Section 350.50(c)(4)(ii)) of the final monograph  requires aerosol antiperspirant drug products to bear the language in  Sec.  369.21. These products do not have to repeat the first general  warning required by Sec.  330.1(g) but need to have the accidental  ingestion warning required by Sec.  330.1(g).     (Comment 8) Two comments objected to the proposed warning in Sec.   350.50(c) for aerosol antiperspirants, which states: ``Avoid excessive  inhalation.'' The comments argued that the warning duplicates and gives  less information than the current warning required for aerosol drug  products under Sec.  369.21.     Section 369.21 requires the following warning statement for a drug  packaged in a self-pressurized container in which the propellant  consists in whole or in part of a halocarbon or hydrocarbon: ``Use only  as directed. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and  inhaling the contents can be harmful or fatal.'' The agency does not  consider this warning (which addresses deliberate misuse) as being the  same as a general statement warning people to avoid excessive  inhalation. There are many people who would not deliberately misuse the  product who should be alerted to keep away from their face and mouth  and to avoid excessive inhalation. The warning appears in the final  monograph in more consumer friendly language and in the new labeling  format as follows: ``When using this product [bullet] keep away from  face and mouth to avoid breathing it.'' (See Sec.  201.66(b)(4) for  description of a ``bullet.'')  C. Comments on Category III Effectiveness Testing      (Comment 9) Several comments objected to user perception testing to  substantiate Category III effectiveness claims. (See comment 24, 47 FR  36492 at 36499.) The comments contended that the user perception test  is not reliably indicative of product effectiveness and offers at best  a crude index of activity that is difficult to employ for precise  qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The comments considered  objective gravimetric sweat collection procedures more reliable than  user perception testing to assess antiperspirant activity levels and  requested that user perception testing be deleted. Three comments  submitted data on user perception testing of Category III claims,  including extra effective, 24-hour duration, emotional sweating, and  foot perspiration (see section II.C, comments 11 through 14 of this  document).     The agency has determined that user-perception test data support  emotional sweating, 24-hour protection, and extra effective claims.  Accordingly, the agency concludes that there are sufficient data on  user perception tests (including both user and independent observer  perception tests) for use of antiperspirants for the underarm. No  further user perception tests are necessary if an underarm  antiperspirant shows at least 20 percent sweat reduction by gravimetric  tests for emotional sweating and 24-hour protection claims or 30  percent sweat reduction for extra effective claims. Adequate user  perception tests have not been conducted for parts of the body other  than the underarms, such as the hands or feet. The agency will still  require user perception and other effectiveness data to support use of  antiperspirants on the hands and feet (see section II.A, comment 4 and  section II.C, comment 14 of this document).     (Comment 10) Several comments objected to the Category III status  of the claims ``problem perspiration'' and ``especially troublesome  perspiration.'' One comment contended these claims are not inherently  misleading or untruthful and many people who do not perspire heavily  may, at times, consider themselves to have ``problem'' or  ``troublesome'' perspiration.     Other comments objected to the agency's definition of problem  perspiration as affecting the upper 5 percent of perspirerers,  contending that a more realistic approach would be to let consumers  define the meaning of these words by running efficacy studies on people  who identify themselves as having problem or especially troublesome  perspiration. One comment objected to the economic consequences of  testing the top 5 percent of the population to establish a ``problem  perspiration'' claim, because this could raise the price for one  efficacy evaluation from the current $5,000 to $10,000 up to $200,000.  The comment requested a hearing on this issue if FDA did not revise its  approach.     No data were submitted to the agency to show that any OTC  antiperspirant drug product is effective in reducing ``problem'' or  ``especially troublesome'' perspiration. The agency is not aware of any  products that currently qualify as effective for those conditions. If  products are found to be effective in the future, the agency will  include a definition and labeling for ``problem'' or ``especially  troublesome'' perspiration in the monograph. The agency proposed in the  tentative final monograph that a 30 percent reduction in sweat  production in the upper 5 percent of perspirerers is necessary for a  ``problem perspiration claim'' (47 FR 36492 at 36500). As discussed in  section II.C, comment 9 of this document, gravimetric testing is  sufficient to prove these claims. The agency would find acceptable an  antiperspirant effectiveness study on a population of individuals who  perceive themselves to have ``problem perspiration,'' as one comment  suggested. Based on changes in the testing to support these claims, the  agency concludes that a hearing is not needed.     (Comment 11) Several comments objected to the agency's proposed  Category II classification of the claims ``extra strength,'' ``extra  effective,'' or any other comparative effectiveness claims (see comment  19, 47 FR 36492 at 36498). The comments argued that if manufacturers  can demonstrate by appropriate testing and methods of statistical  analysis that one product is more effective than another, they should  be permitted to so inform consumers. The comments noted that the agency  had approved an NDA for an acetaminophen ``extra strength'' product and  allowed sunscreen products to label  [[Page 34277]]  their degree of effectiveness. One comment requested a hearing on this  subject.     To prove the validity of comparative claims, two comments submitted  both gravimetric and perceptual data (Refs. 4 and 5). Another comment  submitted gravimetric data only (Refs. 6 and 7) and stated that one  study showed that a 10 percent difference in antiperspirant  effectiveness can be measured with currently marketed antiperspirant  products. This comment stated that adequate data (Ref. 8) had been  submitted to the Panel (43 FR 46694 at 46715) to show that as  differences in antiperspirant performance levels increase, larger  numbers of consumers perceive the difference. These data included a  chart plotting differences in sweat reduction against the percentage of  subjects who noted variations in axillary wetness. The chart shows that  at 20 percent sweat reduction, approximately 45 to 50 percent of the  subjects noticed a difference; at 35 percent sweat reduction,  approximately 60 percent noticed a difference; and at 50 percent sweat  reduction, approximately 75 percent noticed a difference. The comment  contended that this study confirmed the Panel's determination that the  user can perceive a shift of at least 10 percent in antiperspirant  effectiveness and that a product providing a 30 percent or greater  sweat reduction is perceived as more effective than a standard  antiperspirant. The comments requested monograph status for ``extra  strength'' and ``extra effective'' claims, as qualified by gravimetric  studies.     The agency has determined that some of the studies (Ref. 4) meet  the Panel's ``guidelines for user perception test to be done for claims  of `extra-effective' to be classified as Category I'' (43 FR 46694 at  46730). In these studies, two solid stick antiperspirant products  (containing either 10 percent or 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate)  were compared by both a gravimetric and a user perception test. In the  gravimetric test, 91 female subjects used the 10-percent product, and  88 used the 25-percent product. A 17-day conditioning period with no  antiperspirant use was followed by four daily applications of one of  the products to a randomly selected axilla (armpit or underarm). The  opposite axilla received no treatment and served as the control.  Baseline sweat production was determined the first day of the test. On  days two and three, the antiperspirant was applied and 1 hour later a  sweat production sample was collected. On day five, 24 hours after the  fourth application, a sweat production sample was collected. Both the  10- and 25-percent products were more effective than the no treatment  control for all time periods according to the statistical methods  (Wilcoxon signed rank test) in the agency's guidelines for  effectiveness testing of OTC antiperspirant drug products (Ref. 9).  Evaluation of the Z values for the two 1-hour test days and the 24-hour  test day showed that both products were statistically (Wilcoxon test)  at least 20 percent better than the control axilla for all time periods  (p < 0.001 for all three cases). Thus, both products met the  requirements for standard effectiveness, i.e., a minimum of 20-percent  reduction in underarm perspiration. Applying the same statistical  methods to a 30-percent reduction in underarm perspiration on the last  24-hour data showed that the 25-percent product was more effective than  no treatment (p < 0.001) and, thus, met one of the extra effective  criteria.     The same study design was used in the user perception test except  that the subjects applied the 10-percent product under one axilla and  the 25-percent product under the other axilla. On day five, 24 hours  after the fourth application, the 100 female subjects were asked  ``Under which arm do you feel drier?'' All subjects had a preference:  33 favored the 10-percent product and 67 favored the 25-percent  product. A statistically significant number of the subjects were able  to perceive that the 25-percent product was more effective than the 10- percent product (p = 0.0005 one-sided). This result exceeded the  Panel's requirement that 58 out of 100 subjects have a preference for  the test antiperspirant (43 FR 46694 at 46731). Thus, these studies  showed that the 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate met the Panel's  criteria (gravimetric measurements and user perception) for an extra  effective claim.     The agency has determined that the studies indicate that  gravimetric testing shows an adequate difference between a standard  antiperspirant (with a 20-percent reduction in sweat) and an  antiperspirant with at least a 30-percent reduction in sweat, as  required by the Panel, to support an ``extra effective'' claim. The  agency stated in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36499)  that once the level of activity that is perceivable by users has been  established using the Panel's recommended guidelines, it will not be  necessary to perform user perception testing on individual products.  Accordingly, the agency concludes that no further user perception  testing is necessary for an ``extra effective'' claim, which is being  included in the monograph for those antiperspirant products that reduce  underarm perspiration by 30 percent or more using the guidelines for  effectiveness testing of antiperspirant drug products referred to in  Sec.  350.60.     The Panel placed ``extra-strength'' claims in Category II because  it concluded that ``the presence of more active ingredient in an  antiperspirant product cannot be used as a basis for a claim of added  effectiveness because additional amounts of antiperspirant active  ingredient do not necessarily result in improved product  effectiveness'' (43 FR 46694 at 46724). The Panel also stated that  ``the term `extra-strength' normally refers to increased concentration  of the active ingredient which would normally mean added  effectiveness.'' Several comments agreed that more active ingredient  may not yield more effectiveness. Thus, a product containing 20 percent  of an active ingredient (compared to 15 percent) that did not provide  30 percent or more sweat reduction could not claim ``extra strength''  or ``extra effective.''     The agency does not believe that for antiperspirants the claim  ``extra strength'' is as informative to consumers as the claim ``extra  effective.'' The agency considers ``extra effective'' to be the key  information that consumers want to know to select an appropriate  antiperspirant product. The agency is including this new labeling claim  in Sec.  350.50(b)(4) of this final monograph. Based on this  discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this  subject.     (Comment 12) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III  classification of claims for enhanced duration of effect, such as ``24- hour protection,'' ``one spray keeps you comfortably dry all day,''  ``prolonged protection,'' etc. (43 FR 46694 at 46728). One comment  stated that if an antiperspirant product can be shown to provide the  required 20-percent reduction in perspiration under hotroom conditions  for 24, 48, etc. hours after application, then duration claims have  been substantiated.     Three manufacturers submitted gravimetric studies (Refs. 4, 7, 10,  and 11) that used a hotroom to induce sweating and measured sweat  collected in cotton pads twice over a 24-hour period. The tested  ingredients showed a 20-percent or more reduction in sweat production  for both collection times, which the comments contended satisfied  enhanced duration claims such as ``24 hour protection'' and ``all day  protection.'' One comment added that its data (Ref. 11) support a  variety of product forms (cream, roll-on, solid  [[Page 34278]]  stick) and, thus, the enhanced duration effect is not limited to  product form.     The agency has determined that the data support a claim of enhanced  duration for 24 hours according to the Panel's criteria. The protocols  in seven of the studies (Refs. 7 and 10) varied only slightly from the  Panel's recommended protocol. Subjects in one study abstained from  antiperspirant use for 2 weeks prior to the study. Subjects in the  other six studies stopped using antiperspirants 4 weeks prior to the  studies. The subjects were pretreated with an antiperspirant for the 5  days prior to beginning sweat collection procedures. Sweat was  collected 4 and 24 hours following the last antiperspirant application.  Five studies included untreated axilla controls, and two studies  included placebo controls. One product was tested in two different  studies (one with a placebo and one without), and the results were  virtually identical. The tests supported enhanced duration efficacy of  20 percent sweat reduction over the 24-hour period for aluminum  zirconium tetrachloride (15.5 percent roll-on and 18.2 percent stick),  zirconium tetrachloride (20 percent roll-on), aluminum chlorohydrate  (6.8 percent aerosol), and aluminum chloride (20 percent solution).     Other data (Ref. 4) also supported enhanced duration of  effectiveness for antiperspirant solid sticks containing 10 and 25  percent aluminum chlorohydrate. Subjects, who abstained from  antiperspirant use for 17 days prior to the study, were pretreated with  an antiperspirant for the 3 days prior to sweat collection, 1 and 24  hours after the last antiperspirant application. Standard hotroom and  sweat collection procedures were used. Over the 24-hour period, both 10  percent and 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate sticks reduced sweat  production in the treated axilla by 20 percent compared to the  untreated axilla. The 25-percent aluminum chlorohydrate product also  showed a 30-percent reduction in sweat production.     Six other studies (Ref. 11) support enhanced duration claims. Most  products showed a 20-percent reduction in sweat production compared to  an untreated axilla for both the 4- and 24-hour evaluation periods,  with several products showing a 30-percent sweat reduction. However,  the studies did not identify the antiperspirant active ingredients.     The agency is including the following enhanced duration claims in  Sec.  350.50(b)(3) of this final monograph: ``all day protection,''  ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour protection.'' In  order to make such a claim, an antiperspirant product must reduce sweat  production by at least 20 percent over a 24-hour period after  application using the guidelines for effectiveness testing referred to  in Sec.  350.60. Antiperspirant products that meet the extra effective  criteria (see section II.C, comment 11 of this document) over a 24-hour  period can be labeled with both extra effective and enhanced duration  claims (e.g., ``24 hour extra effective protection,'' ``all day extra  effective protection,'' ``extra effective protection lasts all day,''  etc.). Claims of enhanced duration for more than 24 hours are  nonmonograph because the agency has not received any data to  demonstrate antiperspirant effectiveness for more than 24 hours  according to the Panel's criteria.     (Comment 13) Several comments objected to the Panel's Category III  classification of claims for control of emotional sweating, e.g.,  induced by tension or stress (43 FR 46694 at 46728). The comments  contended that a product's antiperspirant activity is the same whether  the sweat is due to thermal conditions or emotional factors. Some  comments disagreed with the need for additional testing, especially  consumer perception testing, to establish these claims. One comment  requested a hearing.     One comment submitted clinical data (Refs. 7 and 12) which it  contended showed: (1) There is a valid scientific protocol that  combines a gravimetric sweat test with a word-quiz stress test to  measure reduction in emotionally-induced sweat; (2) an antiperspirant  is not washed from the axillae during controlled emotional stressing,  and excessive sweat does not diminish antiperspirant effectiveness; (3)  an antiperspirant effective in reducing thermally-induced sweat is  effective in reducing emotionally-induced sweat also; and (4) an  antiperspirant that reduces emotionally-induced sweat by 20 percent or  more meets the standard for antiperspirant effectiveness for which user  perception and benefit has already been accepted and, thus, there is no  need for additional user perception testing. The studies included  aerosol, roll-on, and stick products containing aluminum chlorohydrate  or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, the major antiperspirant  active ingredients.     The agency has determined that gravimetric sweat tests combined  with mental stress tests support an emotionally-induced sweating claim.  The data included 12 studies with the same design of 5 days each on  panels of approximately 25 female subjects: Pretest-abstention from all  antiperspirants for at least 4 weeks prior to the study; day one-- pretreatment control sweat collection under no stress; day two-- pretreatment control sweat collection under emotional stressing; days  two through five--apply test product; and days four and five-- posttreatment sweat collection under emotional stressing. Subjects  applied the antiperspirant test formulation to one axilla and used  either a comparative formulation, a control placebo formulation, or no  treatment on the opposite axilla. A control emotional challenge test,  which lasted for about 60 minutes, was done on day two and an emotional  challenge test was done on days four and five of the study.     Emotional sweating was induced by having subjects do a word  definition test conducted by a moderator experienced at insuring  optimum stress. The subjects received monetary rewards for a correct  definition, but forfeited some of their rewards for incorrect or  untimely definitions. Subjects had a 5-second time limit to begin a  response and a 15-second maximum time to give the actual word  definition. After 60 minutes, sweat was measured gravimetrically from  the preweighed absorbent pads. Standard sweat collection and  statistical evaluation procedures were used. The median sweat output  for the 12 studies was 1,257 milligrams (mg) for the pretreatment  control under emotional stressing compared to 415 mg for the  pretreatment control under no stress. This word definition test  effectively elicited a sweat response.     In the 12 studies using the word definition test, there was at  least a 20-percent reduction of sweat production. The top 10 percent of  heavy sweaters from each study (25 subjects) having the highest  sweating rates on the untreated axilla had a 36.8 percent average sweat  reduction compared to 38.2 percent reduction in the remaining 90  percent of each population (196 subjects), showing no significant  difference in effectiveness in the two groups. Majors and Wild (Ref.  13) obtained similar results when comparing individual percent  reduction in thermal sweating in the antiperspirant-treated axilla to  rate of sweating from the untreated axilla in 89 subjects. They found  that heavy sweating did not affect the rate of reduction.     The products tested under the emotional sweat protocol were also  evaluated under a standard thermal sweat protocol at 100 [deg]F with 30  percent relative humidity. The average percent sweat reduction for  aerosols was 37.0 percent for emotional sweating and 34.0 percent for  thermal sweating, for sticks it was 46.0 percent for emotional  [[Page 34279]]  sweating and 41.4 percent for thermal sweating, and for roll-ons it was  51.3 percent for emotional sweating and 53.3 percent for thermal  sweating. These data show that the same products have similar average  percent sweat reduction for both emotional and thermal sweating.     The agency concludes that gravimetric sweat tests combined with  mental stress tests are sufficient to show effectiveness for control of  emotionally-induced sweating; the data show antiperspirant drug  products that are effective for thermal sweating are also effective for  emotional sweating. The agency has determined that no additional  testing (e.g., user perception tests) is required for an emotionally- induced sweating claim for products containing monograph ingredients  that meet the guidelines for effectiveness testing of antiperspirant  drug products referred to in Sec.  350.60.     The agency is including the following emotionally-induced sweating  claim in Sec.  350.50(b)(2) of this final monograph: ``also [select one  of the following: `decreases,' `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm  [select one of the following: `dampness,' `perspiration,` `sweat,'  `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to stress''. Based on the previous  discussion, the agency concludes that a hearing is not needed on this  subject.     (Comment 14) One comment requested monograph status for 25 percent  aluminum chlorohydrate to control foot perspiration based on  gravimetric and perceptual data from four randomized, double-blind,  bilateral, paired-comparison trials, each having 12 female subjects  (Ref. 14). Treatment was randomly assigned; aluminum chlorohydrate was  used on one foot and placebo on the other foot. A 25 percent aluminum  chlorohydrate solution in 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water and a  placebo control consisting of 50 percent ethanol:50 percent water were  used in the first study. The same solutions in aerosol form were used  in the other three studies. The procedure in the agency's ``Guidelines  for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' (Ref.  9) was modified for foot testing: (1) A 3-day pre-treatment period  during which subjects were not to use any foot care products, with each  subject receiving four daily product applications prior to final  hotroom posttreatment testing collection; (2) sweat collection media  were cotton socks rather than absorbent pads; (3) a required 5-minute  period of mild exercise (walking around the hotroom at the beginning of  each collection period); and (4) a modified method to calculate  effectiveness due to the erratic rate of sweat collections for both  treated and control feet.     The comment stated that the calculation technique included in the  agency's guidelines could not be used for the following several  reasons: (1) The increased number and higher concentration of sweat  glands in the foot area, (2) the occlusive nature of the foot area, and  (3) the erratic rate of sweat collections for both treated and control  feet. The comment contended that by considering the baseline, the  posttreatment sweat collections, and the preferential subject  perception data, statistically significant differences could be shown  between sweat collection values for the treated foot compared to  baseline values.     The comment stated that based on at least a 5-percent difference  between the measured sweat output of each foot, sweat reduction was  achieved for the treated foot in 25 of 48 subjects (52 percent)  compared to only 10 of 48 subjects (21 percent) for the control foot.  The comment added that, based on the user perception questionnaire, 75  percent of the subjects (29 out of 39 subjects who were able to  discriminate) were able to perceive after the hotroom exposure that the  treated foot was drier compared to only 21 percent of the subjects (10  out of 48) who perceived the control foot to be drier.     A second comment submitted a proposed clinical protocol (Ref. 15),  but never submitted any clinical data.     The agency has found the data are insufficient to support a foot  antiperspirant claim. In axillary sweating tests submitted to the  Panel, the range of effectiveness (average percent sweat reduction) of  antiperspirants was 20 to 40 percent in most tests, with aerosols  having a reduction range of 20 to 33 percent (43 FR 46694 at 46713). In  the comment's studies on aluminum chlorohydrate for foot  antiperspirancy (Ref. 14), the average percent sweat reduction was  below 10 percent, which is considerably below the 20 percent minimum  level of sweat reduction recommended by the Panel for efficacy testing  of OTC antiperspirant drug products on the foot (43 FR 46728). In  addition, the agency has a number of concerns about the comment's data  treatment methods: (1) The particular sweat collections selected for  analysis were not chosen consistently across studies but were based on  arbitrarily chosen final sweat measurements that varied with the  different studies, (2) the choice of a 5-percent difference between the  measured sweat output of each foot as ``clinically significant'' seems  arbitrary and was not prespecified in the protocol, (3) the efficacy  criterion used (greater than 15 percent reduction from baseline) was  apparently defined after the data were collected and the results are  therefore potentially biased, and (4) comparison with baseline is not  an adequate basis upon which to conclude product efficacy because it  ignores placebo and time effects that are accounted for in between  product comparisons. The agency's analysis of ``across study'' data  (using the average of the two sweat collections on day four, or average  of the four collections on day four and five as the baseline, and the  average of the two final collections as a measure of the final sweat  product) did not show a statistically significant mean (or mean  percent) sweat reduction from baseline in treated or control feet.     The agency does not agree with the comment's evaluation of its user  perception data, but considers the product as ineffective both in  subjects who preferred placebo and in subjects with no preference. It  appears that the comment chose to ignore tied preferences. However,  when subjects with no preference were included in the analysis, 22 out  of 48 subjects (45.8 percent) and 29 out of 48 subjects (60.4 percent)  preferred the treated foot, before entering and after leaving the  hotroom, respectively. Both proportions are not significantly different  from 1/2 (two-tailed, p = 0.28 and 0.15, respectively). Furthermore,  the subjects apparently could not perceive which foot, treated or  untreated, was drier. More subjects failed to choose the drier foot,  than chose it correctly, both at baseline and posttreatment. Thus, the  wetness perception study failed to show that subjects are able to tell  marginal differences in sweating of the feet.     The agency has concluded that no statistically significant  treatment effect was found in sweat reduction or in subject's  perception of sweat (Ref. 16). Thus, 25 percent aluminum chlorohydrate  has not been shown to be an effective foot antiperspirant. The agency  provided the second comment suggestions on its protocol; a revised  protocol was acceptable (Ref. 17), but no test data were ever  submitted. The agency is not including foot antiperspirancy claims in  the final monograph.  D. Comments on Testing Guidelines      (Comment 15) Several comments requested that the background section  of the effectiveness testing guidelines include the following: ``FDA  recognizes that alternative methodologies may be appropriate to qualify  an antiperspirant drug product as effective. These  [[Page 34280]]  guidelines do not preclude the use of alternative methodologies that  provide scientifically valid results.''     The agency is adding this statement (but changing the words  ``alternative methodologies'' to ``alternate methods'') and adding  ``subject to FDA approval'' to provide for alternate methods and  statistical evaluations of effectiveness test data.     (Comment 16) Several comments requested that the relative humidity  of 35 to 40 percent in the effectiveness testing guidelines be lowered  to 30 percent, the hotroom condition widely used by industry. One  comment submitted the results of effectiveness studies (Refs. 7, 10,  and 18) that used a hotroom operated at 30 + 3 percent relative  humidity. The comment stated that 30 percent relative humidity  accurately measures antiperspirant effectiveness without causing  excessive discomfort to test subjects. Two other comments submitted  effectiveness test data where the relative humidity in the hotroom was  ``about 35 percent'' (Refs. 19 and 20) or ``35 percent +/- 5 percent''  (Ref. 21).     Based on these data, the agency is revising the relative humidity  range for hotroom conditions in the antiperspirant effectiveness  testing guidelines from 35 to 40 percent to a range of 30 to 40  percent. Seven studies (Ref. 10) that showed an enhanced duration of  effectiveness of 20 percent sweat reduction over a 24-hour period for  several antiperspirant products (see also section II.C, comment 12 of  this document) used a protocol (Ref. 18) in which the subjects were  placed in a controlled environment with the temperature held at 100 +/-  2 [deg]F and the relative humidity held at 30 +/- 3 percent. Because  the subjects were able to generate at least 150 mg of sweat per axilla  per 20 minute period, the agency considers the results of the  gravimetric tests valid. In other studies (Refs. 20 and 21), sweating  was induced by having the subjects sit in a hotroom maintained at a  temperature of 100 +/- 2 [deg]F and at a relative humidity of about 35  percent or 35 +/- 5 percent. These studies support claims of extra  effectiveness and enhanced duration (24-hour claims). See section II.C,  comments 11 and 12 of this document. To assure that test subjects sweat  adequately during the hotroom test, the agency is adding the following  baseline perspiration rate condition: ``Baseline perspiration rate.  Test subjects must produce at least 100 milligrams of sweat from the  untreated or placebo control axilla in a 20-minute collection in the  controlled environment.''     (Comment 17) Two comments requested revision of the part of the  antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines that involves  application of a control formulation to the alternate axilla during  testing. Noting that the guidelines state that the control formulation  is to be ``devoid of any antiperspirant activity * * * determined in a  test compared to no treatment,'' a comment contended that it should be  appropriate to compare antiperspirant activity directly against an  untreated axilla and, thereby, reduce the time, complexity, and cost of  the testing, especially the cost of developing a control formulation  ``devoid'' of antiperspirant activity. The comment requested that the  testing guidelines be revised to provide for the application of a  control formulation or no treatment to the other axilla of each test  subject. The other comment submitted data from two studies (Refs. 22  and 23) where one antiperspirant formulation was tested against both a  placebo control and an untreated axilla control with virtually  identical results; therefore, a placebo control was unnecessary to  evaluate product effectiveness.     The data (Refs. 22 and 23) involved an aerosol spray containing 6.8  percent aluminum chlorohydrate tested by two gravimetric sweat tests  under hotroom conditions to substantiate the claim that the product  provides ``all day wetness protection.'' Both studies had the same  design: Day one--pretreatment control collection; days two, three, and  four--application of antiperspirant; and days four and five-- posttreatment sweat collection 4 and 24 hours after application. The  data were evaluated using one of the statistical methods recommended in  the antiperspirant testing guidelines. In one study (Ref. 22), the  product was tested against a placebo aerosol in 44 subjects. The  placebo was identical to the test formulation and supposedly devoid of  antiperspirant activity; the formula difference was adjusted with  aerosol propellant. The results were statistically significant and  showed that the aluminum chlorohydrate aerosol effectively reduced  sweat production by at least 20 percent more than the placebo aerosol  at 4 and 24 hours after application. However, the placebo showed some  antiperspirant activity. In the second study (Ref. 23), the same  product was tested against an untreated axilla control in 49 subjects  with statistically significant results. The aluminum chlorohydrate  aerosol effectively reduced sweat production by at least 20 percent  more on the treated axilla than the untreated control axilla at 4 and  24 hours after application.     The agency is unable to conclude from these data that an untreated  comparator is equivalent to use of a placebo. The observed effect of a  treatment (e.g., antiperspirant) may represent the sum of the  pharmacological effects of the test drug and other effects associated  with the intervention effort, which may include psychological effects  and the effects of the excipients used in a product formulation.  Although studies have been conducted in the past using no treatment for  one axilla, the use of a placebo control for that axilla allows for  assessment of the net treatment effects of the test article. Therefore,  the agency is retaining the requirement for a placebo/vehicle control  in the antiperspirant effectiveness testing guidelines.     The proposed guidelines stated that the control formulation is as  similar as possible to the test formulation and devoid of any  antiperspirant activity. As the placebo used in one study (Ref. 22) was  not completely devoid of antiperspirant activity, the agency is  revising the guidelines to state:     Hotroom procedure. (1) For gravimetric and user perception  testing, treatments consist of the application of the test  formulation to one axilla and the application of a placebo control  formulation to the other axilla of each test subject. Except for the  active ingredient, the placebo control formulation should be as  similar as possible to the test formulation.     The agency concludes that this revised testing procedure will  reduce the time, complexity, and cost of testing because it eliminates  the cost of developing a control formulation ``devoid'' of  antiperspirant activity.  E. Comments on Antiperspirant Active Ingredients      (Comment 18) Several comments noted a discrepancy in a heading in  an active ingredient table in the Panel's report (43 FR 46694 at  46697), where ``Metal:Halide'' is used, and in proposed Sec.  350.10  (47 FR 36492 at 36504), where ``Al:Cl'' is used. Two comments suggested  that ``Al:Cl'' in the table heading and in Sec.  350.10 should be  changed to ``Metal:Cl,'' because the ratio range in the table is for  the ratio of the ``Cl'' to either aluminum (``Al'') or aluminum plus  zirconium (``Al+Zr'').     The agency notes that the ratio range designated as ``A1:Cl'' in  the TFM should have been ``Metal:Halide,'' as it was in the Panel's  report. The agency is not including the ratio range table in Sec.   350.10 of this final monograph because this information is now included  in the U.S. Pharmacopeia-  [[Page 34281]]  National Formulary (USP-NF) monographs for each active ingredient  included in Sec.  350.10, where applicable. The agency is changing the  introductory text of Sec.  350.10 to state: ``Where applicable, the  ingredient must meet the aluminum to chloride, aluminum to zirconium,  and aluminum plus zirconium to chloride atomic ratios described in the  United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary.''     (Comment 19) Two comments agreed with the agency that buffer  components present in the compound, such as glycine or glycol, should  be omitted when calculating the maximum allowable concentration of  active ingredients in an antiperspirant product (47 FR 36492 at 36495).  One comment noted a potential source of confusion because the active  ingredients table in proposed Sec.  350.10 included the buffer names  along with the active ingredient names. To minimize confusion and to be  consistent with the agency's policy regarding buffers, the comment  requested the agency to remove the buffer names from the ``active  ingredient'' column in Sec.  350.10. The comment proposed a number of  changes in the active ingredient section.     When the Panel first discussed terminology for aluminum chloride  and aluminum chlorohydrate antiperspirant active ingredients, the  buffer additives were not included (Ref. 24). Subsequently, the  Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (CTFA) Antiperspirant  Task Force developed definitions for aluminum chlorohydrex complexes  with propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, and for aluminum  zirconium chlorohydrex complexes with glycine (Ref. 25). The Panel  adopted these definitions, including those for ingredients with  buffered additives, in its report (43 FR 46694 at 46696 and 46697), and  the agency proposed this nomenclature in the TFM (47 FR 36492). Since  the comment was submitted, the USP-NF developed names for these  antiperspirant active ingredients that include the names of the  buffers, where applicable, and active ingredient names in this final  monograph include the buffer, where applicable.     The agency considers calculation of the concentration of an  antiperspirant ingredient present in a product based on the amount of  anhydrous ingredient to be appropriate. Buffered antiperspirant  ingredients contain the same active chemical moiety as the  corresponding nonbuffered ingredients, and the antiperspirant activity  of both ingredients is similar.     (Comment 20) One comment requested the agency allow concentrations  of antiperspirant active ingredients above those proposed in the  monograph as long as the amount of ingredient applied to the skin is  not greater than the amount judged safe by the Panel. The comment noted  that, in the TFM (comment no. 12, 47 FR 36492 at 36495 to 36496), the  agency had disagreed with earlier comments on this issue and stated  that ``the comments included no new data to show that a higher  concentration of antiperspirant active ingredient marketed in a  particular container would deliver no more than the amount of active  ingredient judged safe by the Panel.''     The comment submitted new data from eight usage studies (Ref. 26)  to support a higher (up to 35 percent) active ingredient concentration  for powder roll-on antiperspirant drug products. Fifty male and female  subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, participated in each study.  Subjects were given a preweighed product and instructed to use only  that product, to keep a record of how many times they used it, and not  to allow anyone else in the household to use the product. An average of  43 subjects completed the 1-week studies and returned their product to  the laboratory where it was reweighed.     The amount of product applied with each use was calculated. The  four powder roll-ons, which contained 33 percent aluminum zirconium  tetrachlorohydrate, were found to deliver between 23 and 44 mg of  antiperspirant ingredient per axilla per use. The other product forms  (solid stick, cream, or liquid roll-on), containing 18 to 19 percent of  either aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate,  were found to deliver between 54 and 98 mg of antiperspirant ingredient  per axilla per use. The comment contended these data show that higher  concentrations of active antiperspirant ingredients, as used in powder  roll-on systems, deposit no more and, in fact, deposit less active  ingredient than is deposited in a liquid roll-on, solid stick, or cream  product containing proposed monograph concentrations of active  ingredients. Thus, the comment argued that concentrations up to 35  percent of Category I active ingredients should be allowed in powder  roll-on antiperspirants.     This issue was specifically brought before the Panel, which did not  agree to change the maximum concentration (Ref. 27). The Panel noted  that aluminum antiperspirants can be irritating, expressed concern that  a small amount of a concentrated formulation may be more irritating  than a large amount of a more dilute formulation, and concluded that  antiperspirant products with a higher concentration would need an NDA  with additional safety studies. The agency notes that increasing the  concentration of aluminum antiperspirant ingredients increases the  acidity of the material and irritation of the skin (Refs. 28, 29, and  30). The agency concludes that safety data are needed to show that  powder roll-on dosage forms containing up to 35 percent aluminum  chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium chlorhydrates are not irritating.     Since the TFM was published, several citizen petitions have raised  concerns about the amount of aluminum absorbed from topical  antiperspirant drug products. (See section II.F, comment 23 of this  document.) The agency has no data showing that products containing up  to 35 percent aluminum chlorhydrates or aluminum zirconium  chlorhydrates increase aluminum absorption and is not revising the  monograph to provide for powder roll-on dosage forms containing up to  35 percent antiperspirant active ingredient, without additional safety  data being provided.     (Comment 21) One comment requested monograph status for aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared by neutralizing aluminum chloride with  magnesium hydroxide even though the aluminum to chloride (Al:Cl) ratio  of the ingredient prepared in this manner does not fall within the  range specified for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate in the TFM. The  comment stated that during the course of the rulemaking all aluminum  chlorhydrates placed in Category I were prepared by conventional  techniques: Either by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum  monochlorohydrate or by a controlled reaction of aluminum metal with  hydrochloric acid. Thus, the comment argued that it was both  appropriate and convenient to characterize the various aluminum  chlorhydrates in terms of their Al:Cl ratios.     The comment stated that its data showed that the reaction of  aluminum chloride with magnesium hydroxide yields aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate equivalent to that listed in the TFM and the  neutralizer magnesium hydroxide does not contribute either aluminum or  chloride ions to the neutralization process; thus, the Al:Cl ratio of  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared this way will always remain 0.33,  the same as aluminum chloride alone. The comment was concerned because  this Al:Cl ratio of 0.33 does not fall within the ratio range of 1.9  down  [[Page 34282]]  to but not including 1.25:1 proposed for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 36492 at 36504). The comment  contended that if the final product is regarded as a mixture of  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride, and if the amount  of chloride that serves as counter ions for the magnesium ions were  subtracted from the total chloride, then the Al:Cl ratio of the  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate component of the mixture would have the  Al:Cl ratio specified in the TFM. The comment submitted data (Ref. 31)  using gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis of the  eluates (the substance separated out by washing) to show that aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared by this neutralization method is  chromatographically indistinguishable from that prepared by  conventional methods. The comment suggested designating the ingredient  prepared by the neutralization method as ``aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  MAG.''     The agency does not find these analytical data sufficient to  support the comment's claim that the ingredient prepared by this  neutralization method is chemically equivalent in composition to  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. The chromatographic indistinguishability  from aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared by conventional methods only  demonstrates that the chromatographic method in this study is  insufficient to support the claim. This result perhaps is to be  expected because the gel permeation chromatographic method used in this  study is based primarily on a size exclusion principle; however, the  agency doubts that any chromatographic method will provide such  support.     USP 23-NF 18 Fifth Supplement (Ref. 32) added a monograph for  aluminum sesquichlorohydrate and described it as consisting of complex  basic aluminum chloride that is polymeric and loosely hydrated and  encompasses a range of aluminum-to-chloride atomic ratios between  1.26:1 and 1.90:1. Its chemical formula is stated as:  Al y (OH) 3y-z Cl z .nH 2 O.     According to the method described in the comment, when aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate is prepared by the reaction of aluminum chloride  with magnesium hydroxide, the product must be a mixture of aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate and magnesium chloride. The agency does not  consider it suitable from a technical point of view to simply designate  this material as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. Information provided by  the comment shows that the alternate process material is not  ``equivalent in composition'' because the aluminum to chloride ratio of  0.33 is outside the specified range for aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  and because the material contains measurable amounts of magnesium.  Also, as discussed in section II.E, comment 18 of this document,  because the atomic ratio range should be metal to halide, magnesium  should be counted as a metal in the atomic ratio range of the comment's  material. Using the name aluminum sesquichlorohydrate for an ingredient  prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with magnesium  hydroxide would be misleading because this would imply that the drug is  the same identifiable ingredient as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate  prepared by neutralization of aluminum chloride with aluminum  chlorohydrate. The agency believes the material described in the  comment should be classified as a new ingredient, perhaps an aluminum  magnesium chlorohydrate, rather than aluminum sesquichlorohydrate.     The agency concludes that additional information on the chemical  characterization of the proposed material, particularly its ionic  structure, is needed to permit a more scientific review. The submitted  information does not provide a technical basis for allowing the  substitution of aluminum sesquichlorohydrate manufactured by  neutralization with magnesium chloride for that neutralized with  aluminum monochlorohydrate. The USP-NF monograph (Ref. 32) does not  contain information to characterize or identify an aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate containing magnesium (e.g., no identification or  content test, and no assay involving magnesium calculations).     Further, the agency notes that no clinical efficacy data were  provided to show that the material proposed in the comment would be  equally effective as aluminum sesquichlorohydrate prepared in the  conventional manner. Even minor variations in formulation, such as the  addition of emollients or buffers, can alter the effectiveness of an  antiperspirant ingredient. (See comment no. 8 in the TFM (47 FR 36492  at 36494).) The new mixture may be just as effective. However, whether  such a finding would apply to equal amounts, or whether an equivalent  effect could be achieved with a greater or lesser amount of aluminum  sesquichlorohydrate prepared with magnesium hydroxide, should be  determined by effectiveness testing that follows the guidelines  referred to in Sec.  350.60 of the final monograph. The agency needs  appropriate effectiveness data and an appropriate USP-NF monograph  amendment (see 21 CFR 330.14(i)) before the ingredient prepared by the  new method can be generally recognized as safe and effective and  included in the final monograph.     (Comment 22) One comment objected to the agency's rejection of its  earlier request (discussed in comment no. 9 of the TFM, 47 FR 36492 at  36495) that combinations of two or more Category I antiperspirant  ingredients should be Category I. The comment stated that the  combination policy in Sec.  330.10(a)(4)(iv) allows combinations of two  or more safe and effective active ingredients; thus, the Panel should  be reversed.     In the TFM (47 FR 36495), the agency concurred with the Panel (43  FR 46694 at 46718) that both combinations of antiperspirant active  ingredients and combinations of antiperspirant active ingredients with  other types of active ingredients (except for a deferred  antiperspirant/antifungal combination) are Category II because of no  information on the existence of any such combinations or any data to  support their safe and effective use.     The agency classified antiperspirant/antifungal combination drug  products in Category III in the TFM for OTC antifungal drug products  (December 12, 1989, 54 FR 51136 at 51148 and 51149). No additional data  were submitted to support this combination, and in the final monograph  for OTC antifungal drug products (September 23, 1993, 58 FR 49890 at  49891), the agency classified all antifungal combination drug products  as nonmonograph.     The comment did not provide any supporting data or specific  examples of Category I antiperspirant ingredients that would be  suitable for use in combination with other antiperspirant or  nonantiperspirant Category I ingredients. Thus, the combination policy  does not apply. These combinations remain nonmonograph. However, new  clinical data may be submitted to support safety and effectiveness.  F. Comments on the Safety of Aluminum Ingredients      (Comment 23) The information and arguments presented by the citizen  petitions that questioned the safety of aluminum-containing ingredients  in OTC antiperspirant drug products and the comment that disagreed with  one of the citizen petitions were discussed in detail in the Federal  Register of March 23, 1993 (58 FR 15452 at 15453 and 15454). One  petition was concerned that aluminum can be absorbed and get into the  blood and that some of the aluminum in the blood enters the brain,  [[Page 34283]]  where it remains and accumulates. The petition cited a study by Perl  and Good (Ref. 33) that suggested that inhaled aluminum compounds could  have a direct nasal-olfactory pathway to the brain. The other petition  contended that two inhalation studies (Refs. 34 and 35) provided by  industry showed aluminum absorption in the peribronchial lymph nodes,  brain, and adrenal glands of the animals after 12 and 24 months. Both  petitions expressed concern about the potential neurotoxicity of  aluminum upon chronic use, especially a possible link to Alzheimer's  disease.     The comment that disagreed with one petition contended that the  majority of the petitioner's references described findings from in  vitro studies that did not consider the blood-brain barrier, which is  the brain's main defense against potentially toxic substances such as  aluminum. The comment contended that extraordinarily high  concentrations of aluminum were used in these studies, and that  aluminum from antiperspirants would never reach a biologically  significant level to be of concern. The comment stated that the  majority of researchers investigating the etiology of Alzheimer's  disease would consider current evidence insufficient to link aluminum  to Alzheimer's disease. The comment concluded that current scientific  information does not support the need to reclassify the safety of  aluminum-containing antiperspirants.     The agency does not find the current evidence sufficient to  conclude that aluminum from antiperspirant use results in Alzheimer's  disease. Both petitions mention the widely quoted study by Perl and  Good (Ref. 33) as showing that inhaled aluminum compounds may get  directly into the brain by a nasal-olfactory pathway. The agency does  not consider this animal study (published as a one-page Letter to the  Editor in Lancet) as adequate to establish a direct nasal-olfactory  pathway for aluminum. This study was only a small pilot animal study,  about which the agency has a number of concerns.     First, the method of introducing the aluminum to these animals was  not physiologically relevant. Two strips of Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin  sponge, USP) saturated with high concentrations of aluminum salts (15  percent aluminum lactate or 5 percent aluminum chloride) were inserted  into rabbits' left nasal recess through a hole drilled into the frontal  bone. While the authors attempted to demonstrate the accessibility of  aluminum from the nasal recess to the brain, the agency questions  whether the normal use of antiperspirant aerosols would ever produce a  high aluminum concentration in this relatively distant anatomic site.  Second, the size of this study was very small (only three rabbits in  each group). The agency is concerned that any error in this complicated  surgical procedure to introduce the aluminum salts or in preparing the  specimens for analysis could have caused a major difference in the  final results. Third, the results were not consistent. Of the three  animals exposed to aluminum lactate, besides the involvement of the  left olfactory bulb and the cerebral cortex, only one rabbit had a  lesion in the hippocampus while the other two rabbits had granulomas  found in the pyriform cortex. In the group exposed to aluminum  chloride, only one rabbit had a granuloma in the olfactory bulb while  the other two rabbits were free of lesions. The distribution of lesions  in this study was fairly random. If a nasal-olfactory pathway exists  for neuronal aluminum transport, the agency believes that the  distribution of these lesions should follow a more persistent  anatomical pattern. In addition, the authors were unable to explain why  two of the six rabbits were free of lesions. Finally, although some of  the rabbits had granulomas, these lesions did not resemble the plaques  or neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease, and none of  the rabbits had any symptomatic neurologic deficit. While this study  implied that access to the brain via the nasal recess may be possible  under nonphysiological conditions, a direct nasal-olfactory pathway and  any relationship to Alzheimer's disease cannot be established. Several  other studies, which were not done with aluminum, are of no value in  establishing a direct nasal-central nervous system pathway for aluminum  antiperspirants.     Aluminum lactate, one aluminum salt used in this study (Ref. 33),  is not included in this final monograph. Sodium aluminum lactate has  been used as a buffer for aluminum sulfate in a nonaerosol dosage form,  but that product is nonmonograph.     In one of the inhalation studies (Ref. 34), the life-span of the  male hamsters exposed to the aluminum chlorhydrate aerosol was shorter  (583 days) than that of the controls (661 days). The female hamsters  exposed to aluminum chlorhydrate had a slightly longer life-span (489  days) than the controls (481 days). Male hamsters exposed to aluminum  chlorhydrate coated with a high concentration of isopropyl myristate,  an emollient frequently used to increase the retention on the skin of  the aluminum salts used in antiperspirant products, had a life-span  (646 days) comparable to the controls (661 days). Overall, these  numbers do not follow a consistent pattern and could be affected by  other experimental conditions.     The same petition criticized the other inhalation study (Ref. 35),  contending that the results showed that the animals had suffered  significant weight loss and increased terminal brain-to-body weight  ratios, results it considered consistent with clinical aluminum  toxicity, and that the increase in brain weight was possibly due to  cerebral edema. The petition claimed that because aluminum was found to  be deposited in the animals' brains, peribronchial lymph nodes, and  adrenal glands, this proved that systemic absorption of aluminum had  occurred and that aluminum had been transported to the brain. Other  comments disagreed with the petition's argument that the rats in this  study were found to have detectable aluminum levels in their brains  after 12 months, contending that this finding may only be artificial  considering the analytical methods used. The comments added that if  aluminum did accumulate in the rats' brains, those rats should have had  symptoms of neurotoxicity, which they did not have. The comments  concluded that the artificial finding should be ignored.     The agency does not concur with the petition's extrapolations. The  weight loss occurred only in rats and not in guinea pigs that were  similarly treated. The increase in terminal brain-to-body weight ratio  occurred only in the female rats at 12 months in the low- and high-dose  groups. The female rats in the middle-dose group and all the males were  not affected. At 24 months, this same ratio was found to increase only  in the high-dose groups of both sexes; however, the increase in the  female high-dose group was not statistically significant. The agency  notes that all of these findings did not follow any predictable pattern  or a pattern that would be expected from a dose-related or cumulative  toxin exposure.     The pattern of deposition was not consistent. In the guinea pigs,  aluminum was found in the peribronchial lymph nodes, but not in the  adrenal glands and brains (as occurred in the rats). The agency finds  it possible that aluminum absorption and deposition may be animal  dependent. If this were the case, then even if the rat data were  evidence of a problem, the same situation may not apply to humans. The  agency is not aware of other investigators having similar results.     The petitions and the comment had different views on a study by  Rollin,  [[Page 34284]]  Theodorou, and Kilroe-Smith (Ref. 36) in which rabbits were exposed to  aluminum oxide dust for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 5 months. The  authors of the study found that the brains of these rabbits had a  significant increase in aluminum at the end of the study. The first  petition contended that this study showed that the inhalation of  aluminum antiperspirants poses a special risk because this route of  delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier. The comment calculated that  this study would be equivalent to a person using spray antiperspirants  for approximately 10 seconds daily for 789 years to experience the same  toxicity. The second petition contended that this 10-seconds-exposure  assumption was incorrect because the aluminum particles in an  antiperspirant aerosol remain suspended in the air for a long period of  time, and the exposure will be more than the comment calculated.     The agency finds this study has a number of limitations: (1) The  extraordinary high concentrations of aluminum oxide exposure in the  animals, (2) the small sample size (eight animals in each group), and  (3) an overlap in the standard deviations of the results obtained  decreases the power and generalizability of the study. While the study  shows an accumulation of aluminum in the rabbits' body tissues under  certain exposure conditions, the agency does not consider the study as  providing evidence of a direct nasal-olfactory pathway or that normal  use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants would provide comparable  results. Further, the second petition's position includes a number of  assumptions, which might not occur: (1) That the place where the  product is used is a confined, poor-ventilated airspace, and (2) that  the user remains in the vicinity of the dispersed aerosol for a period  of time during which significant inhalation would occur.     One petition claimed that an epidemiology study by Graves et al.  (Ref. 37) has shown that Alzheimer's disease was associated with the  use of aluminum antiperspirants and that a high incidence of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease in Chamorro  natives of Guam, as reported by Garruto (Ref. 38), may be related to  high environmental aluminum. The agency has looked closely at the  Graves et al. study (Ref. 37) because it explored the association  between exposure to aluminum through the lifetime use of  antiperspirants and antacids and Alzheimer's disease. This was a case- control study of 130 matched pairs, where the controls were friends or  nonblood relatives of the case. Subjects (cases and controls) were  matched by age, sex, and the relationship between the case/control and  his or her surrogate (spouse or child).     The authors mentioned that, in general, antiperspirants contain  aluminum and deodorants do not, except for some deodorants marketed for  women. The authors reported that there was no association between the  use of ``any'' antiperspirant/deodorant and Alzheimer's disease.  However, when the data were stratified by aluminum-containing  antiperspirants the overall odds ratio showed a modest increase in risk  and a statistically significant trend emerged between increasing  lifetime use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants and the estimated  relative risk of Alzheimer's disease.     The authors commented that, to their knowledge, this was the first  epidemiological study of this association between antiperspirants and  Alzheimer's disease, and there were several methodologic limitations  that made interpretation of their results difficult. First, there were  missing data because the case surrogate and the control surrogate could  only recall all variables (frequency and duration of use, and product  brand name) in about one-half of the matched pairs. Second, there might  have been some misclassification because the analyses were based on the  most common brand provided, while some subjects may have used multiple  brands. Third, the authors considered the validity of the data,  resulting from difficulty in learning the subjects' exposure using  telephone interview methods, to be a critical limitation. Despite these  limitations, the authors considered an association between aluminum- containing antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease as biologically  plausible, but concluded that their findings are provocative and, due  to methodologic problems, should be considered preliminary.     Garruto (Ref. 38) described efforts to establish models of chronic  motor neuron degeneration in a long-term effort to understand the  cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum neurotoxicity. He studied  foci of dementia (ALS and Parkinson's disease) in western Pacific  populations. He mentioned experimental models in rabbits and cell  culture as demonstrating that chronic, rather than acute, toxicity is  the cause of human neurodegenerative disorders with a long latency and  slow progression. However, Garruto stated that he and his colleagues  had been most deficient in the design and implementation of good  epidemiological studies, particularly of Alzheimer's disease and the  epidemiology of aluminum intoxication per se, and described what he  felt was needed for future well-designed studies.     The petitions/comment also discussed environmental exposure to  aluminum, percutaneous absorption after topical use, inhaled absorption  after aerosol use, aluminum neurotoxicity (and a possible relationship  to Alzheimer's disease), and possible mechanisms of action. Numerous  references were provided. The agency has reviewed these references and  other literature published on aluminum since the petitions were  submitted. Many early references were simply hypotheses and different  theories that have not been adequately substantiated in humans or any  animal models. A number of studies were pilot projects in a few  animals, and the agency is unable to draw any definite conclusions  based on the small sample sizes.     The agency notes Priest's (Ref. 39) statement that most  investigators now agree that aluminum is unlikely to be implicated in  causing Alzheimer's disease, whereas Rowan (Ref. 40) contended it would  be considerably more correct to state that the issue is controversial.  More recently, Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that the question whether  aluminum presents a health hazard to humans as a contributing factor to  Alzheimer's disease is still subject to debate.     The agency finds the literature shows the issue of aluminum  toxicity and Alzheimer's disease remains controversial and is not  resolved. Scott et al. (Ref. 42) reported that aluminum has been  detected in Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, but the significance of  its presence is unknown. Kasa, Szerdahelyi, and Wisniewski (Ref. 43)  reported that histochemical staining showed that aluminum was present  in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease victims, but the structural  localization indicated that it is not primarily involved in the  etiology of the disease. Candy et al. (Ref. 44) reported that data from  post mortem brain examinations of patients with chronic renal failure  who did not have dialysis encephalopathy suggest that it is unlikely  that aluminum plays any major role in neurofibrillary tangle formation  and that its role in senile plaque formation is likely to be only part  of a complex cascade of changes. Savory et al. (Ref. 41) stated that  the lack of agreement on the question whether the brain content of  aluminum is increased in Alzheimer's disease attests to the complexity  of the issue.     Savory et al. (Ref. 41) indicated that most of the data linking  aluminum  [[Page 34285]]  exposure to Alzheimer's disease have been derived from several  epidemiological studies of aluminum in drinking water, which represents  only a small percentage of the total exposure. They concluded that  quantification of the risk of Alzheimer's disease from other sources of  aluminum (such as food additives, cosmetics, deodorants,  antiperspirants, pharmaceuticals, and respiratory dusts) is needed  before the total risk from all environmental sources of aluminum can be  fully evaluated.     Despite Graves et al.'s acknowledgment of the limitations of their  study (Ref. 37), other authors, e.g., Anane et al. (Ref. 45), report  that Graves et al. found an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease with  lifetime use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants after an  epidemiological study. Anane et al. applied low aqueous concentrations  (0.025 to 0.1 micrograms (microg)/square centimeter) of aluminum  chloride (AlCl 3 .6H 2 O) to healthy shaved Swiss  mouse skin for 130 days. They reported that this led to a significant  increase in urine, serum, and whole brain aluminum, especially in the  hippocampus area, compared to control animals. They mentioned that this  percutaneous uptake and accumulation of aluminum in the brain was  greater than that caused by dietary exposure to 2.3 microg per day in  feed and water.     Anane et al. conducted in vitro and in vivo mouse skin studies and  showed for the first time that aluminum is absorbed through mouse skin  and this contributes to a greater body burden than does oral uptake.  They also mentioned that several antiperspirant preparations containing  AlCl 3 .6H 2 O are applied to sensitive regions of  the skin, which may increase penetration and could be an important  source of body aluminum burden. Anane et al. recommended that an  epidemiological study be conducted to ascertain whether use of  AlCl 3 .6H 2 O-containing antiperspirants correlates  with neurodegenerative disease, because such cannot be excluded based  on the results of their study.     Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) stated that there is uncertainty about  how aluminum-containing substances enter the body, but current  information suggests that the skin and/or the lung are important. They  mentioned that Priest (Ref. 39) noted that at least some antiperspirant  sprays contain aluminum compounds of a particle size of about 1  micrometer (micron) (micro), which is ideally sized for deposition in  the deep lung, and that such deposition may also be relevant for skin.     Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) examined clinically diagnosed  Alzheimer's disease patients and controls (other dementias and  nondementias) and collected information to examine the association  between Alzheimer's disease and aluminum occupation. They reported that  manual work, such as welding, expected to be in direct contact with  aluminum dust and fumes does not appear to be significantly associated  with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The authors concluded that no  significant association was shown between developing Alzheimer's  disease later in life and previous occupational history for all of the  occupations in the study. This included both manual workers, who would  be expected to have had a higher exposure opportunity to aluminum dust  and fumes, and other workers at an aluminum factory. The authors  concluded that neither Alzheimer's disease nor dementia in general were  shown to be associated with previous aluminum occupation.     Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47), in 1996, repeated Doll's (Ref. 48)  conclusions from 1993 that it is generally accepted that the delayed  effects of chronic aluminum exposure have not been adequately assessed  in man. Factors that govern the bioavailability, neurotoxicity, and the  effect of chronic low dose exposure to aluminum compounds remain  unclear. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the lack of a readily  available radioactive isotope of aluminum has been a major obstacle  toward elucidating the mechanisms of absorption, distribution, and  excretion of the metal.     Both Doll (Ref. 48) and Salib and Hillier (Ref. 47) stated that the  possibility of a causal link between aluminum and Alzheimer's disease  must be kept open until uncertainty about neuropathological evidence is  resolved and the prognosis of humans exposed to aluminum by inhalation  is known. Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) stated that multidisciplinary  collaborative research efforts, involving scientists from many  different specialities, are needed, with emphasis placed on: (1)  Increasing knowledge of the chemistry of aluminum in biologic systems  and determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aluminum  toxicity, and (2) variations in neuropathology from long-term, low- level exposure to aluminum.     In summary, the literature shows that at high doses and long-term  industrial exposures, aluminum can be associated with recognizable,  specific neurologic effects. However, to date, the agency considers the  evidence insufficient to link aluminum to Alzheimer's disease,  Parkinson's disease, or ALS. Although aluminum uptake and transport by  a ``nasal-olfactory pathway'' has been suggested in a nonphysiologic  study in an animal model (Ref. 36), the agency is not aware of any  evidence in humans that supports an olfactory-neuronal transport of  aluminum to the brain.     One petition suggested that the agency require that 90 percent of  the particles of an aerosol aluminum antiperspirant be greater than 50  micro (currently the requirement is between 10 and 50 micro) to reduce  exposure to the upper respiratory tract. The agency notes that both  Priest (Ref. 39) and Forbes and Agwani (Ref. 46) discussed a particle  size of 1 micro for deposition in the deep lung. Based on current  knowledge (no proof in humans of an olfactory neuronal transport of  aluminum to the brain) and the lack of information on a minimum  particle size to affect the respiratory tract, the agency finds no  basis to impose a greater than 50micro requirement at this time. Flaten  et al. (Ref. 49) stated that the possible human toxicity of aluminum  has been a matter of controversy for well over 100 years. Despite many  investigators looking at this issue, the agency does not find data from  topical and inhalation chronic exposure animal and human studies  submitted to date sufficient to change the monograph status of aluminum  containing antiperspirants. The agency will continue to monitor the  scientific literature on aluminum and, if new information appears, will  reassess the status of aluminum-containing antiperspirants at such  time.     The agency acknowledges that small amounts of aluminum can be  absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin. Assuming  a person has normal renal function, accumulation of aluminum resulting  from usual exposures to antiperspirant drug products (application to  the underarms once or twice daily) and subsequent absorption is  considered minimal. However, people with renal dysfunction have an  impairment in normal renal excretion of aluminum.     Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) noted that the first human conditions  generally accepted to be causally related to aluminum exposure did not  occur until the 1970's, shortly after the introduction of routine  dialysis therapy in persons with chronic renal failure. Dialysis  encephalopathy was perhaps the first disease recognized in this  population (1972, 1976). Later, fracturing osteomalacia (1977, 1978)  and a microcytic hypochromic anemia (1980) were related to aluminum  exposure in dialysis patients. Flaten et al. indicated that aluminum  can cause encephalopathy, bone disease, and anemia in dialysis patients  resulting  [[Page 34286]]  from the introduction of aluminum directly into the blood stream via  high-aluminum dialysate or the consumption of large oral doses of  aluminum-containing phosphate binders. Reduced urine production (the  major route for aluminum excretion) contributes to this problem. The  authors noted that, in the early 1980's, reports began to appear  describing aluminum neurotoxicity and osteotoxicity in children with  renal failure who were not on dialysis treatment.     The agency is concerned that people with renal dysfunction may not  be aware that the daily use of antiperspirant drug products containing  aluminum may put them at a higher risk because of exposure to aluminum  in the product. The agency considers it prudent to alert these people  to consult a doctor before using or continuing to use these products on  a regular basis and is including a warning in the final monograph:  ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.``     Flaten et al. (Ref. 49) mentioned several reports of aluminum  accumulation and toxicity in individuals without chronic renal failure,  especially preterm infants (primarily fed intravenously), and stated  that preterm infants are at risk for aluminum loading because of their  immature kidney function. Term infants with normal renal function may  also be at risk because of their rapidly growing and immature brain and  skeleton, and an immature blood-brain barrier. Until they are 1 to 2  years old, infants have lower glomerular filtration rates than adults,  which affects their kidney function. The agency is concerned that young  children and children with immature renal function are at a higher risk  resulting from any exposure to aluminum. Accordingly, the agency is  requiring both general warnings in Sec.  330.1(g) on all aluminum- containing antiperspirant drug products to inform parents and others to  keep these products away from children, and to seek professional  assistance if accidental ingestion occurs. (See also section II.B,  comment 7 of this document.)     (Comment 24) One comment submitted a research paper (Ref. 50)  containing the author's theories concerning how antiperspirants and  aluminum in these products may be associated with breast cancer: The  secretions of the apocrine sweat glands contain androgens, which are  blocked by the antiperspirant and thus caused to spread internally.  These androgens may be converted in the surrounding adipose tissues to  estrogens, and excess estrogens have been associated with an increase  in breast cancer. Alternatively, these excess androgens may interfere  with the normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thereby  causing an imbalance of estrogen in the body. About 50 percent of  breast cancers occur in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and  axillary sweat glands are anatomically very close to this site. A  protein marker called GCDFP-15 (Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein),  which is normally found only in the sweat glands, was found in the  fluids of many breast cysts. The author postulated that the blocked  axillary sweat glands would cause GCDFP-15 and other markers to migrate  to the breast due to its proximity and gravity, and because the fetal  precursors for apocrine sweat glands and mammary glands are the same,  these migrated protein markers may stimulate the breast and play a role  in the carcinogenic process.     The author also postulated that aluminum may play a role in the  development of breast cancer because calcification of breast tissues  (commonly seen in breast cancer) may be caused by a local electrolyte  imbalance induced by the absorbed aluminum. The author noted that  breast cancer in Japan was more than five times lower than in the  United States and postulated this has occurred because Japanese women,  especially the older population, do not use antiperspirants. The author  noted that the breast cancer rate is currently on the rise in Japan,  especially among young premenopausal women, and postulated that this is  occurring because the young Japanese generation has adopted the western  habit of using antiperspirants.     The agency finds these theories lack sufficient evidence. The  agency notes that the amount of androgens produced by the sweat glands  is relatively insignificant compared to normal physiologic amounts  produced by the adrenals and the gonads. The agency is not aware of any  studies that have shown an ``internal spread'' of androgens or that  establish that GCDFP-15 or other protein markers are carcinogenic in  humans.     The agency considers the author's views about a local electrolyte  imbalance by absorbed aluminum causing breast tissue calcification  inconsistent with knowledge about the calcification process. In  addition, there are many benign calcifications. Finally, many proposals  (e.g., diet, lifestyle changes) have been made as to why there is an  increased incidence of breast cancer among Japanese women. However,  there is no evidence to associate this increase with an increased use  of antiperspirants. Thus, the agency concludes that there is  insufficient evidence to support these theories.     (Comment 25) The agency previously assessed the carcinogenic  potential of aerosolized aluminum chlorhydrate antiperspirants in  comment 22 of the TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36498 and 36499). Primary lung  tumors, granulomatous lesions, and macrophagic activity were evaluated  in animal studies. No increase in lung tumors was seen in the low- and  mid-dose rats given doses at least 100 times greater than the expected  human exposure via aerosolized antiperspirants. Normal macrophage  response and pulmonary fibrosis were observed at higher doses with  chronic exposure. No increase in tumors was noted in guinea pigs or  hamsters at any dose levels in the studies. While the agency removed  aerosol antiperspirant products containing zirconium from the market  because of granuloma formation (August 16, 1977, 42 FR 41374), the  agency is not aware of data that indicate aluminum antiperspirants  cause foreign body granulomas or pulmonary tumors.  III. Agency Changes      1. It has been agency policy since April 3, 1989 (54 FR 13480 at  13486), that before any ingredient is included in a final OTC drug  monograph, it must have a compendial (USP-NF) monograph. Compendial  monographs include an ingredient's official name, chemical formula, and  analytical chemical tests to confirm the quality and purity of the  ingredient. These monographs establish public standards for the  strength, quality, purity, and packaging of ingredients and drug  products available in the United States. Eighteen of the 19  antiperspirant active ingredients that the agency proposed in Sec.   350.10 of the antiperspirant TFM (47 FR 36492 at 36504) currently have  compendial monographs. Nine of the official compendial names are the  same as those proposed in Sec.  350.10, while 10 of the names have  changed slightly. (See Table 1 of this document for the previous and  current ingredient names.)  [[Page 34287]]                   Table 1.--Antiperspirant Active Ingredients ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Name in Tentative Final Monograph              Current Name ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chloride                           Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrate                      Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrex polyethylene glycol   Aluminum chlorohydrex  complex                                     polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum chlorohydrex propylene glycol      Aluminum chlorohydrex  complex.                                    propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrate                    Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrex polyethylene        Aluminum dichlorohydrex  glycol complex                              polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum dichlorohydrex propylene glycol    Aluminum dichlorohydrex  complex.                                    propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate                Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrex polyethylene    Aluminum sesquichloro-hydrex  glycol complex                              polyethylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sesquichlorohydrex propylene       Aluminum sesquichloro-hydrex  glycol complex                              propylene glycol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum sulfate buffered\1\                Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrate        Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex         Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             octachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrate       Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex        Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             pentachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate       Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex        Aluminum zirconium  glycine complex                             tetrachlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrate         Same ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex glycine  Aluminum zirconium  complex                                     trichlorohydrex gly ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Aluminum sulfate buffered with sodium aluminum lactate.      The agency is including in Sec.  350.10 of this final monograph  those antiperspirant active ingredients that currently have a  compendial monograph. Only one active ingredient, aluminum sulfate  buffered, does not have a current or proposed compendial monograph.  While aluminum sulfate does have a compendial monograph, the buffer  component, sodium aluminum lactate, does not. This buffer ingredient  must also have a compendial monograph or there must be a compendial  monograph for aluminum sulfate buffered in order for aluminum sulfate  buffered to be included in the antiperspirant final monograph. At the  present time, this ingredient is being included in Sec.   310.545(a)(4)(ii) as a nonmonograph ingredient because the agency is  not aware of any pending compendial monograph being developed. Should a  compendial monograph eventually be developed, the agency will move this  ingredient from Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(ii) to Sec.  350.10.     2. The agency is revising the format for active ingredients in  Sec.  350.10 for consistency with recent monographs: The proposed chart  format is now a paragraph format listing ingredients in alphabetical  order. The amount of active ingredient is stated as ``up to ----------  percent'' instead of as ---------- percent or less concentration.'' The  information about calculating the concentration on an anhydrous basis  is moved to the preamble of Sec.  350.10. The preamble statement about  aluminum to chloride and/or aluminum to zirconium ratios is revised to  state: ``Where applicable, the ingredient must meet the aluminum to  chloride, aluminum to zirconium, and aluminum plus zirconium to  chloride atomic ratios described in the United States Pharmacopeia- National Formulary.'' The proposed ratio range table is not included in  the final monograph because this information is now included in the  USP-NF monographs for each active ingredient in Sec.  350.10, where  applicable.     3. The agency is expanding the indications proposed in Sec.   350.50(b) of the TFM to provide additional uses based on new  effectiveness data. The agency is also revising the uses format to make  it more concise.     Because the indications proposed in Sec.  350.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and  (b)(3) of the TFM are very similar, the agency is combining them as a  single indication with choices under Sec.  350.50(b)(1): [Select one of  the following: ``decreases,'' ``lessens,'' or ``reduces''] ``underarm''  [select one of the following: ``dampness,'' ``perspiration,''  ``sweat,'' ``sweating,'' or ``wetness'']. (See section II.B, comment 6  of this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  Sec.  350.50(b)(2): ``also [select one of the following: `decreases,'  `lessens,' or `reduces'] underarm [select one of the following:  `dampness,' `perspiration,' `sweat,' `sweating,' or `wetness'] due to  stress''. (See section II.B, comment 6 and section II.C, comment 13 of  this document.) The agency is adding a new additional indication in  Sec.  350.50(b)(3): Select one of the following: [``all day  protection,'' ``lasts all day,'' ``lasts 24 hours,'' or ``24 hour  protection'']. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) The  agency is adding a new additional  [[Page 34288]]  indication in Sec.  350.50(b)(4) that states ``extra effective''. This  claim applies to products that demonstrate 30 percent or more sweat  reduction using the guidelines for effectiveness testing of  antiperspirant drug products referred to in Sec.  350.60. (See section  II.C, comment 11 of this document.) The agency is adding a new  additional indication in Sec.  350.50(b)(5) for products that  demonstrate extra effectiveness sustained over a 24-hour period: These  products may state the claims in Sec. Sec.  350.50(b)(3) and (b)(4)  either individually or combined, e.g., ``24 hour extra effective  protection,'' ``all day extra effective protection,'' ``extra effective  protection lasts 24 hours,'' or ``extra effective protection lasts all  day''. (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.)     4. The agency is revising the ``Do not apply * * *'' warning in  proposed Sec.  350.50(c)(1) to the new labeling format. The warning now  reads: ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or  irritation occurs''.     5. The agency is including a warning to alert people with renal  dysfunction to consult a doctor before using antiperspirants containing  aluminum. The warning appears in the new labeling format and states:  ``Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease''. (See section  II.F, comment 23 of this document.)     6. The agency has revised the August 1982 Guidelines for  Effectiveness Testing. The revised guidelines (dated as of the date of  publication of this document) state that ``FDA recognizes that  alternate methods may be appropriate to qualify an antiperspirant drug  product as effective. These guidelines do not preclude the use of  alternate methods that provide scientifically valid results, subject to  FDA approval.'' (See section II.D, comment 15 of this document.)     The agency has revised parts of the test procedures section of the  guidelines to delete the requirement that the control formulation be  devoid of ``any'' antiperspirant activity. Therefore, the control  formulation no longer needs to be compared to no treatment. (See  section II.D, comment 17 of this document.) The agency has changed the  permitted relative humidity of the hotroom conditions from 35 to 40  percent to a range of 30 to 40 percent. (See section II.D, comment 16  of this document.) The agency has added a requirement for ``baseline  perspiration rate'' to assure that test subjects sweat adequately  during a hotroom test: ``Test subjects must produce at least 100  milligrams of sweat from the placebo control axilla in a 20-minute  collection in the controlled environment.'' (See comment 16 also.)     Because the final monograph contains 24-hour duration effectiveness  claims, the agency has revised section 4(a)(4) of the guidelines to  state: ``For claims of enhanced duration of effect, the test should be  conducted at least two times during the period of the claim, such as 1  hour and 24 hours after the last daily treatment for 24 hour claims.''  (See section II.C, comment 12 of this document.) Because the final  monograph contains ``extra-effective'' claims shown by standard  gravimetric testing to have a 30-percent or more reduction in sweat,  the agency has revised the guidelines to include a section on data  treatment to demonstrate, with high probability, at least 50 percent of  the target population will obtain a sweat reduction of at least 30  percent. (See section II.C, comment 11 of this document.)     The revised ``Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC  Antiperspirant Drug Products'' are now dated as of the date of  publication of this final rule and are on file in the Dockets  Management Branch (address above) and on FDA's Web site at  http://www.fda.gov/cder/otc/index.htm .  Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the  guidelines should submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) request in  writing to FDA's FOI Staff (HFI-35), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857. The agency has revised Sec.  350.60 to include this information  about the guidelines.  IV. Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule      1. The agency is modifying the definition of an antiperspirant that  was proposed in Sec.  350.3 of the TFM to delete the phrase ``to the  underarm.'' (See section II.B, comment 2 of this document.)     2. The agency is revising the format for listing active ingredients  in Sec.  350.10. (See section III.2. of this document.)     3. The agency is expanding the indications for OTC antiperspirant  drug products based on new data that support these additional uses (see  section III.3. of this document) and is expanding the ``Guidelines for  Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products'' to address  some of these additional uses (see section III.6. of this document).  V. The Agency's Final Conclusions      The agency is issuing a final monograph establishing conditions  under which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized  as safe and effective and not misbranded; 18 ingredients listed in  Sec.  350.10 are a monograph condition. In the Federal Register of  November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46914), the agency published a final rule in  part 310 establishing that certain active ingredients that had been  under consideration in a number of OTC drug rulemaking proceedings were  not generally recognized as safe and effective. That final rule  included the antiperspirant ingredients aluminum bromohydrate, aluminum  chloride (alcoholic solutions), aluminum chloride (aqueous solution)  (aerosol only), aluminum sulfate, aluminum sulfate buffered (aerosol  only), potassium alum, and sodium aluminum chlorohydroxy lactate in  Sec.  310.545(a)(4), and was effective on May 7, 1991. In this final  rule, the agency is redesignating the text of paragraph (a)(4) as  paragraph (a)(4)(i), adding new paragraph (a)(4)(i) heading, and adding  new paragraph (a)(4)(ii) to contain aluminum sulfate buffered with  sodium aluminum lactate. Any drug product labeled, represented, or  promoted for use as an OTC antiperspirant drug that contains any of the  ingredients listed in Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) or that is  not in conformance with the monograph (21 CFR part 350) may be  considered a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) and  misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). Such a drug  product can not be marketed for OTC antiperspirant use unless it is the  subject of an approved application under section 505 of the act (21  U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR part 314. An appropriate citizen petition to  amend the monograph may also be submitted in accord with 21 CFR 10.30  and Sec.  330.10(a)(12)(i). Any OTC antiperspirant drug product  initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into  interstate commerce after the effective date of the final rule for  Sec.  310.545(a)(4)(i) or after the compliance dates of this final rule  that is not in compliance with the regulations is subject to regulatory  action.     Mandating warnings in an OTC drug monograph does not require a  finding that any or all of the OTC drug products covered by the  monograph actually caused an adverse event, and FDA does not so find.  Nor does FDA's requirement of warnings repudiate the prior OTC drug  monographs and monograph rulemakings under which the affected drug  products have been lawfully marketed. Rather, as a consumer protection  agency, FDA has determined that warnings are necessary to ensure that  these OTC drug products continue  [[Page 34289]]  to be safe and effective for their labeled indications under ordinary  conditions of use as those terms are defined in the act. This judgment  balances the benefits of these drug products against their potential  risks (see Sec.  330.10(a)).     FDA's decision to act in this instance need not meet the standard  of proof required to prevail in a private tort action (Glastetter v.  Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Corp., 252 F.3d 986, 991 (8th Cir. 2001)). To  mandate warnings, or take similar regulatory action, FDA need not show,  nor do we allege, actual causation. For an expanded discussion of case  law supporting FDA's authority to require such warnings, see ``Labeling  of Diphenhydramine-Containing Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human  Use, Final Rule'' (67 FR 72555, December 6, 2002).  VI. Analysis of Impacts      An analysis of the costs and benefits of this regulation, conducted  under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in the TFM for OTC  antiperspirant drug products (47 FR 36492 at 36503). The one comment  received is addressed in section II.A, comment 4 of this final rule and  further addressed later in this section.     FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive  Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). Executive  Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of  available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to  select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including  potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other  advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Under the Regulatory  Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic impact on a  substantial number of small entities, an agency must analyze regulatory  options that would minimize any significant impact of the rule on small  entities. Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  requires that agencies prepare a written statement of anticipated costs  and benefits before proposing any rule that may result in an  expenditure in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, in  the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million (adjusted  annually for inflation). The proposed rule that has led to the  development of this final rule was published on August 20, 1982, before  the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was enacted. This final rule  will not result in an expenditure in any one year by State, local, and  tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100  million.     The agency concludes that this final rule is consistent with the  principles set out in Executive Order 12866 and in these two statutes.  Additionally, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as  defined by the Executive order. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does  not require FDA to prepare a statement of costs and benefits for this  final rule, because the final rule will not result in any 1-year  expenditure that would exceed $100 million adjusted for inflation. The  current inflation adjusted statutory threshold is about $110 million.     FDA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While the  exact number of affected small entities is difficult to determine at  any given time, the agency received only one comment from a small  entity, which is discussed later in this section. This discussion  explains the agency's determination that this final rule will not have  a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities.     The purpose of this final rule is to establish conditions under  which OTC antiperspirant drug products are generally recognized as safe  and effective and not misbranded. This includes establishing the  allowable monograph ingredients and labeling. Eighteen of the 19 active  ingredients under review are included in the final monograph. The  remaining ingredient could have been included had a USP-NF monograph  been developed for this ingredient. If a USP-NF monograph is developed  before the effective date of this final monograph, products containing  this ingredient could continue to be marketed without reformulation.  Without a USP-NF monograph for the ingredient, product reformulations  to include a monograph antiperspirant active ingredient or  discontinuation of the products will need to occur. The agency believes  that this one antiperspirant active ingredient is currently in only a  few products. Based on the large number of antiperspirant drug products  in the OTC marketplace and the vast array of products that one known  affected company currently markets, the agency considers the required  reformulation or discontinuation of a few products not to be overly  burdensome or substantial. The one known affected company markets at  least 30 products not affected by this final rule. Only one of its  products includes the active ingredient excluded under the final rule.  Any company using this active ingredient has the option to: (1)  Reformulate using any of the 18 active ingredients included in this  final rule, (2) reformulate without this active ingredient and market  the product as a deodorant, or (3) discontinue the product.     This final rule establishes the monograph labeling for OTC  antiperspirant drug products and will require relabeling of all  products covered by the monograph. The agency's Drug Listing System  identifies approximately 200 manufacturers and 700 marketers of 1,300  OTC antiperspirant drug products containing the 19 ingredients covered  by this final rule. It is likely that there are additional products  that are not currently included in the agency's system. While it is  difficult to determine an exact number, the agency estimates that about  1,500 OTC antiperspirant drug products will need to be relabeled based  on this final rule.     The agency has been informed that relabeling costs of the type  required by a final monograph generally average about $3,000 to $5,000  per stock keeping unit (SKU) (individual products, packages, and  sizes). However, some of the relabeling that occurs as a result of this  specific final monograph will be due to additional indications that the  agency has included in the final monograph and that manufacturers will  wish to add to their labeling. Assuming that there are about 1,300 to  1,500 affected OTC SKUs in the marketplace, total one-time costs of  relabeling would be $3.9 million ($3,000 per SKU x 1,300 SKUs) to $7.5  million ($5,000 per SKU x 1,500 SKUs). The agency believes that actual  costs will be lower for several reasons. First, many of the label  changes will be made by private label manufacturers that tend to use  relatively simple and less expensive labeling. Second, the agency has  finalized a revised labeling format for OTC drug products in Sec.   201.66. The agency is allowing manufacturers to incorporate the  labeling changes required by this final rule along with the new general  OTC drug labeling format. Thus, the relabeling costs resulting from two  different but related final rules will be individually reduced by  implementing both required changes at the same time.     Some relabeling costs will be further reduced because the agency is  allowing up to 18 months (24 months for products with annual sales less  than $25,000) for these revisions so they may be done in the normal  course of business. Thus, manufacturers who  [[Page 34290]]  wish to add additional indications included in this final monograph can  do so at their next regular printing of product labeling. Among the  steps the agency is taking to minimize the impact on small entities  are: (1) To provide enough time to enable entities to use up existing  labeling stock, and (2) to allow the labeling changes required by this  final monograph to be done concurrently with the changes required by  the new OTC drug labeling format. The agency believes that these  actions provide small entities substantial flexibility and reductions  in cost.     The agency considered but rejected several labeling alternatives:  (1) A shorter or longer implementation period, and (2) an exemption  from coverage for small entities. While the agency believes that  consumers would benefit from having this new labeling in place as soon  as possible, a longer time period would unnecessarily delay the benefit  of new labeling and a few revised formulations. Conversely, a shorter  time period was also considered but rejected because it would be  inflexible and more costly for the affected companies. The agency  rejected an exemption for small entities because the new labeling and  revised formulations, where applicable, are also needed by consumers  who purchase products marketed by those entities. However, a longer  (24-month) compliance date is being provided for products with annual  sales less than $25,000.     One small manufacturer has indicated that it will suffer economic  consequences because it will no longer be able to make claims for use  of its antiperspirant products on the hands, and for prosthesis and  orthotic use. However, the manufacturer did not provide sufficient data  to show that its products were safe and effective for these uses and  did not provide documentation to show the economic impact of this final  rule on its sales. The agency notes that the company could: (1) Relabel  its products to contain only the monograph indications and then remain  in the marketplace, or (2) discontinue its products. While revising the  product labeling may have an economic impact on a company, it will be  able to continue to market its products and can use the expanded  indications provided by the final monograph to try to enhance product  sales.     The final rule would not require any new reporting and  recordkeeping activities, and no additional professional skills are  needed. There are no other Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or  conflict with the final rule.     For the reasons in this section and under the Regulatory  Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the agency certifies that this final  rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility  Act, no further analysis is required.  VII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995      FDA concludes that the labeling requirements in this document are  not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget because  they do not constitute a ``collection of information'' under the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Rather, the  labeling statements are a ``public disclosure of information originally  supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of  disclosure to the public'' (5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2)).  VIII. Environmental Impact      The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.31(a) that this action is  of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant  effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental  assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.  IX. Federalism      FDA has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles  set forth in Executive Order 13132. FDA has determined that the rule  does not contain policies that have substantial direct effects on the  States, on the relationship between the National Government and the  States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the  various levels of government. Accordingly, the agency has concluded  that the rule does not contain policies that have federalism  implications as defined in the Executive order and, consequently, a  federalism summary impact statement is not required.  X. Section 369.20 Revision      Section 369.20 (21 CFR 369.20) contains a recommended warning and  caution statement for OTC antiperspirant drug products under the  heading ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS:'' ``Do not apply to broken skin. If a rash  develops, discontinue use.'' This statement is very similar to, but not  quite as extensive as, the warnings required by the final monograph:  ``Do not use on broken skin'' and ``Stop use if rash or irritation  occurs''. The agency is removing the entry for ``ANTIPERSPIRANTS''  under Sec.  369.20 because it is superseded by Sec. Sec.  350.50(c)(1)  and (c)(2).  XI.

General Comments         Comments by Sidney M. Wolfe, MD   Director, Public Citizens Health Research Group   On Federal Register Notice concerning Ephedra Alkaloids  Extension of Docket 95N-0304      Is the FDA Part of the Public Health Service or   The Ephedra Industry Survival Service?                   For an agency that promised, for months, that definitive action concerning ephedra alkaloids would be taken upon completion of the Rand review, the lack of definitive action in the March 7 Federal Register Notice represents a pitiful reminder of how beholden the Administration is to the death- and injury-dealing ephedra industry. First, asking the public to comment on whether the legal standard for banning ephedra alkaloids can be met; second, asking for comments on a warning label that, if read and adhered to would still predictably result in deaths and injuries since most of these adverse effects did not occur in those using higher doses or engaging in vigorous exercise; and, finally, asking for further evidence of the dangers of these products, are all delaying tactics that will guarantee further deaths and injuries in the interval between March 7 and the inevitable ban.     At the time of our September 2001 petition to the FDA to ban ephedra alkaloids (http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7053), there was already more than adequate evidence of unreasonable risk of harm when these products were used as recommended. Since then, other than what must be described as more of the same--additional deaths and disabling injuries that would not have occurred if there had been a ban 18 months ago--the legal standard continues to be met.      What follows is an explanation, based on medical and scientific articles published well before our petition and available to anyone at the FDA, about the relationship between ephedra alkaloids and arrhythmias.      In addition to well-documented cases of strokes, presumably related to the hypertension-inducing properties of ephedra, there have been a number of sudden deaths after using ephedra of young people with no history of cardiovascular problems, including some with structurally normal hearts at autopsy. The following example, which I have condensed from medical records and an autopsy report, exemplifies this problem:    A 37-year-old woman with no past medical history suddenly collapsed in April 2002. Since there was no abnormal autopsy finding, it was assumed that she died of a cardiac arrhythmia.  At autopsy, there was no evidence of a heart attack, atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis. The pharmacologic findings consisted of non-lethal (therapeutic) levels of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (both are components of herbal ephedra) in her blood. She was 53, 110 pounds and was using a natural herbal energizer/diet supplement for weight loss.    The existence of such cases warrants a brief discussion of the mechanism, involving stimulation of cardiac cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereby drugs like ephedra alkaloids can cause arrhythmias.     Early evidence of the role of increased cardiac cAMP levels in causing arrhythmias showed that the perfusion of cAMP into isolated rat hearts decreased the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and that further lowering of the threshold occurred with the administration of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, which, like caffeine, increases tissue cAMP by inhibiting its breakdown.  By 1980, experiments with intact pig hearts found that the infusion of beta adrenergic stimulants such as adrenaline or isoproterenol, which increase cardiac cAMP levels, may play an important role in the initiation or perpetuation of ventricular tachycardia and that the combination of such drugs and cAMP and calcium ions may act via a common pathway to induce pacemaking activity [that can initiate ventricular arrhythmias] in the intact ventricular myocardium.  Subsequent human studies established that people with structurally normal hearts can experience exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia triggered by increased cAMP levels and that this can be stopped or prevented with beta blocking drugs that inhibit accumulation of cAMP.   All of this is quite consistent with the arrhythmia-provoking properties of ephedra alkaloids.    The dangers of these products, combined with the attractiveness of products that allegedly improve fitness and strength, have led to a number of deaths and serious damage in people in the armed services. According to Navy Surgeon General Richard Nelson, All three military services have documented medical cases where significant adverse events and deaths have occurred among active duty service members taking certain dietary supplements, specifically preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids. This led to a Navy ban of the sale of ephedrine-containing dietary supplements from stores at Pearl Harbor and the Marine base at Kaneohe Bay. As the administration is aware, last August (2002) their sale was also banned in Army and Air Force commissaries and PXs  following reports of more than 30 deaths in active duty military personnel using these products.

There continue to be serious questions about the risks surrounding this particular dietary supplement.    Today's Actions   HHS announced a series of actions designed to protect Americans from potentially serious risks of dietary supplement products containing ephedra and cautioned about the use of such products, especially under conditions of strenuous exercise and in combination with other stimulants, including caffeine.    What action is HHS taking?      Seeking rapid public comment on the new evidence on health risks associated with ephedra to establish an up-to-date record as quickly as possible to support new restrictions on ephedra-containing products.      Seeking rapid public comment on whether the currently available evidence and medical literature present a ""significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" from dietary supplements containing ephedra.      Seeking rapid comment on a strong new warning label on any ephedra products that continue to be marketed.      Immediately executing a series of actions against ephedra products making unsubstantiated claims about sports performance enhancement.      In seeking the 30-day public comment period, FDA is reopening a proposed rule entitled ""Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids,"" which would have required a warning statement for these products, as well as restrictions on their potency and composition. FDA later withdrew parts of this proposed rule because of concerns about the specific scientific evidence, expressed by the General Accounting Office.        Why are we taking these steps?      There continue to be serious questions about the risks surrounding ephedra, and we therefore caution all Americans about using dietary supplements containing ephedra.      Although the overall evidence suggests that serious adverse events from ephedra appear to be infrequent, we know that such events can be very serious and possibly fatal.      We believe that the current scientific evidence strongly suggests that at least some ephedra products may present an unreasonable risk.      We are particularly concerned about the risks of using products containing ephedra during heavy workouts, with caffeine and other stimulants, in a diet program that stresses the cardiovascular system, or by people under the age of 18.        What evidence is there that ephedra may be harmful?      A RAND Corporation study commissioned by NIH concluded ephedra is associated with higher risks of mild to moderate side effects such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper gastrointestinal effects, and symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor and insomnia, especially when taken with other stimulants.      The RAND review of 16,000 adverse event reports revealed two deaths, four heart attacks, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases involving ephedra in which the records appeared thorough and no other contributing factors were identified. RAND called such cases ""sentinel events,"" because they may indicate a safety problem but do not prove that ephedra caused the adverse event.        A study published this month in the  Annals of Internal Medicine  found that although ephedra products make up less than 1 percent of all dietary supplement sales, these products account for 64 percent of adverse events associated with dietary supplements.      A study published in the journal  Neurology  concluded that the rate of hemorrhagic (bleeding) strokes among ephedra users was statistically significantly higher than among non-users, for people who take doses above 32 milligrams a day. Many ephedra dietary supplement labels recommend that users take up to approximately 100 mg of ephedra daily.       Background on ephedra      Ephedra is a naturally occurring substance derived from the Chinese herbal Ma Huang. While products containing natural ephedrine alkaloids have long been used to treat certain respiratory symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine, in recent years they been extensively promoted and used with the goals of aiding weight loss, enhancing sports performance, and increasing energy.     Background on the law      FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.      The law allows FDA to prohibit sale of a dietary supplement if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury.""      This legal standard of ""significant or unreasonable risk"" implies a risk-benefit calculation based on the best available scientific evidence.      It strongly suggests that the FDA must determine if a product's known or supposed risks outweigh any known or suspected benefits, based on the available scientific evidence, in light of the claims the product makes and in light of the product's being sold directly to consumers without medical supervision.       What is next?      Once the comment 30-day period has ended, FDA will analyze the comments and publish its conclusions about the most appropriate approach to reducing the risk of using dietary supplement products containing ephedrine alkaloids.
