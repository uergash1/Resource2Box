GX040-07-2295085	"A Successful Public/Private Partnership      to Remedy Homelessness in Fairfax County            Project HOMES is a joint venture of the Department of Family Services, the    Department of Housing and Community Development, and local faith groups, community    organizations and businesses.           Our Mission               To assist families and adults in finding homes; to offer friendship        to the discouraged; to bring hope of future independence; and to prevent        homelessness from being repeated.                       These are the services that faith    groups, community organizations and businesses involved in Project HOMES have    provided and continue to provide. A valuable partnership between government    and its citizens, Project HOMES contributes to the well-being of our entire    community.   How It Works    Through Project HOMES (Housing Organizations Making Efforts to Serve), faith    groups, community non-profit organizations and businesses ""adopt""    homeless families and individuals in the county's Emergency Housing and Shelter    Program who have lost housing through no fault of their own. They act as sponsors    and may also assist financially.    The role of Fairfax County Department of Family Services, which administers    Project HOMES, is to identify appropriate families and adults, match them with    a specific group, support the volunteers who work with them, and follow each    match to completion.       Since its inception in 1988, Project HOMES has worked with over 75 faith groups and community organizations.   More than 500 homeless families and single adults have located housing through      this program.       Why Homelessness?  While lack of affordable housing is the primary cause of homelessness in Fairfax  County, other reasons people have lost their housing include:                        Abandonment        Divorce and loss of support       Domestic violence (spouse and/or child abuse)        Eviction      Family crisis                      Low wages and layoff        Mental health crisis         Prolonged illness        Unemployment               The trauma of being homeless often worsens personal and family problems. It    is harder for homeless persons to maintain steady employment. Their credit ratings    are adversely affected, and the high cost of rent and deposits makes it difficult    for them to find affordable housing.     About Homelessness   No longer regarded simply as an urban phenomenon, homelessness is a major national    concern. In recent years, homelessness in Fairfax County has mirrored state    and national trends: families and children are the fastest growing subpopulation    of the homeless. Another significant trend is that even though many homeless    persons are working, they cannot find housing because of a lack of affordable    housing.

GX076-87-11966531	"Rep. Tiahrt Votes to Repeal Social Security Earnings        Penalty for Working Seniors           Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, H.R. 5, Passes        House 422-0         (Washington) Rep. Todd Tiahrt joined today in a bi-partisan        effort to repeal the Social Security earnings penalty that penalizes        senior citizens by reducing their Social Security benefits if they choose        to work. H.R. 5 repeals the Social Security ""earnings limit"" that affects        approximately 800,000 Social Security recipients between the full        retirement age (currently age 65) and age 70. This current law policy        reduces, and in some cases eliminates, seniors' Social Security benefits        if they work and earn more than annual income limits (which amount to        $17,000 in 2000). The measure affects income earned after December 31,        1999 (i.e., beginning this year, seniors age 65 and older may work and        earn unlimited income without losing any Social Security benefits).         A CBO estimate indicates that enactment will cost $22.7        billion over the next 10 years. However, actuaries from the Social        Security Administration have indicated that the cost of the measure over        the long term is negligible.          Rep. Tiahrt said, ""I am pleased with the passage of this        important legislation in a bi-partisan manner. Yet another plank in the        Contract with America, the repeal of this earnings limit, will become law.        It is time the tax code stops penalizing seniors who choose to        work.""                   Case Study:             Ida is 66 years old. Her Social Security benefit is          $417/monthly (approx. $5,000 annually). This year she takes a part time          job as a cashier at a grocery store, earning $18,500. This is how the          earnings test will affect her:            Ida's earnings in 2000-- $18,500           Earnings limit in 2000 -- $17,000            Ida's earnings in excess of limit -- $ 1,  500           Benefit reduction in 2000 = 1/3 of excess -- $          500            Ida will lose $500 of her Social Security benefits this          year because of the earnings penalty. This means she will lose her          entire benefit in one month ($417) and part of her benefit in a second          month ($83).

GX089-36-9032591	"For Immediate Release   March 22, 2000    Contact: Donna Boyer   (202) 225-3026        Â     Work Incentives for Blind and Disabled Social Security Beneficiaries Focus of Hearing Tomorrow   Social Security Recipients, Deputy Commissioner, GAO to Testify   Hearing Tomorrow, March 23rd, at 10 a.m. in 1100 LHOB    Washington, D.C. â The Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee will hold a hearing tomorrow to examine various work incentives available to the blind and disabled on Social Security.Â  The Subcommittee will also examine potential costs and the positive work experiences of individual beneficiaries.Â  The hearing will take place tomorrow, March 23rd, in room 1100 Longworth HOB beginning at 10:00 a.m.Â Â   ""We should do all we can so every disabled worker has opportunities and incentives to stay in the workforce.Â  Everyone wants that.Â  That is what the Ticket to Work legislation passed last year was all about.Â  But we need to do more.Â  This hearing will help to show us the way,""  said Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw (R-FL).  BACKGROUND:   Social Security provides benefits for individuals who are blind or disabled and unable to work because of their medical conditions.Â  To qualify for benefits, an individual must be unable to perform work for pay due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.Â  A person is considered able to work or engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) if earning at or above a certain dollar level (known as the SGA level).Â  The SGA test applies to both determining initial and continuing eligibility for benefits.Â   Prior to 1977, all disability beneficiaries, as well as blind beneficiaries, were subject to the same SGA limit, established in regulation by the Social Security Administration.Â  The Social Security Amendments of 1977 increased the amount of the SGA limit for blind beneficiaries to the same amount as the age 65 earnings limit, but did not change the SGA limit for all other disabled beneficiaries.Â  The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 increased the age 65 earnings limit, but did not change current law with respect to the blind.Â   In 2000, the SGA limit for blind beneficiaries is $1,170 per month and this amount is indexed annually for wage growth.Â  The limit for non-blind disability beneficiaries was increased from $500 to $700 per month in July 1999, after remaining at the same level for the past 10 years.    -###-  Home  |  About Rep.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors' survey found that ""overall demand for both emergency food and shelter grew during 1997 for most of the surveyed cities.  Demand for food increased at a higher rate, and in more cities, than has been reported in recent years, and demand for shelter increased at a lower rate, and in fewer cities, than in past years -- although more of the shelter demand remained unmet, and shelters in more cities have had to turn people away.""  Among the findings, cities report:  HUNGER  **  an average increase of 16% in the number of requests for emergency food assistance (86% of cities registering an increase). **  19% of all requests for emergency food assistance go unmet. **  emergency food assistance facilities may have to turn away people in need due to lack of resources (71% of cities). **  emergency food assistance facilities have had to decrease the number of bags of food provided and/or the number of times that people can receive food (76% of cities). **  causes of hunger include low-paying jobs, unemployment, food stamp cuts, high housing costs, poverty or lack of income, and low benefits in public assistance programs.  HOMELESSNESS  **  3% increase in the number of requests for emergency shelter (59% of cities). **  an average of 27% of the requests for emergency shelter by homeless people overall and 32 percent of the requests by homeless families alone are estimated to have gone unmet during the last year. **  causes of homelessness include substance abuse and lack of needed services, lack of affordable housing, mental illness, low paying jobs, domestic violence, and changes and cuts in public assistance.  HOUSING  **  an increase in requests for assisted housing by low income families and individuals(75% of cities). **  applicants must wait an average of 19 months for public housing in the survey cities. **  elimination of Section 8 incremental certificates will mean a longer wait for assisted housing, more overcrowding and increased homelessness.  IMPLEMENTING WELFARE REFORM IN AMERICA'S CITIES reports on a 34-city survey regarding the impact that the new welfare law is having, and is expected to have, on metropolitan areas.  The Task Force on Welfare Reform Implementation of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, found cities' welfare concerns include:  JOBS  **  of the cities able to provide jobs data, 92% anticipate an inability to meet the welfare law's work participation requirements due to an insufficient number of low-skill jobs. **  transportation was cited as a major problem in getting TANF and Food Stamp recipients to work (84%); however, 74% of cities report plans to provide transportation to work for recipients.  CHILD CARE  **  state reimbursement inadequately covers the cost of full day center-based child care (71%) and home based child care (62%). **  29% of cities anticipate that children who are not receiving child care subsidies would be displaced from child care.  LEGAL IMMIGRANTS  **  the average waiting time to become a naturalized citizen has lengthened, now averaging 13.5 months (92%); however, 64% of cities report the implementation of programs to assist in naturalization efforts.

GX013-18-7076345	EXECUTIVE ORDER Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   EO 91-01    Â     ESTABLISHING A STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS    Â     Â     An  increasing and unacceptable number of Washington citizens are becoming homeless. The reasons for homelessness are many and complex. They include a lack of affordable housing, wages and transfer payments which do not keep up with the rising cost of housing, domestic violence, shortage of special housing with support services for persons with mental illnesses, the problems of alcoholism and substance abuse, and the growing number of troubled youth.    Â     Private businesses, charitable organizations, cities, counties, the federal government, and the State of Washington have started to invest substantial resources in assisting the homeless and have begun to address the root causes of homelessness. Because homelessness is a multifaceted problem, its solution requires a coordinated blend of resources and efforts from the private sector and all levels of government.    Â     NOW, THEREFORE,  in recognition of the nature of the problem, the need for coordination, and to put into action the first recommendation of the Governor's Task Force on Homelessness in its report to me, I, Booth Gardner, Governor of the State of Washington, do hereby establish a State Advisory Council on Homelessness, as follows:    Â     1. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The Council shall consist of up to 15 members selected by the Governor to represent private businesses, non-profit organizations that provide services to the homeless, public housing authorities, cities, counties, and the federal government. In addition, the Council shall consist of the Directors of the Department of Community Development, Department of Social and Health Services, Employment Security Department, Department of Health, Department of General Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Corrections, and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or their designees.    Â     2. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The Director of the Department of Community Development shall chair the Council, with a vice chair selected from among the members who do not represent state agencies. The members shall serve without compensation except for reimbursement for travel expenses to and from meetings. Staffing to the council shall be provided by the Department of Community Development with the assistance of other member state agencies.    Â     3. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Each state department shall cooperate with the Council, and furnish it with such information as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this order.    Â     4. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The Council shall meet at least quarterly in locations agreed upon by the members.    Â     5. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The Council shall carry out the following responsibilities:    Â     a. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Review actions recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Homelessness and advise the Governor on what measures can be taken to coordinate state efforts on behalf of people who are homeless.    Â     b. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Make annual policy recommendations to the Governor on ways to enhance the state's ability to respond to the needs of people who are homeless.    Â     c. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Provide a forum for representatives of private businesses, service providers, and local, federal, and state government to address issues and coordinate programs relating to homelessness across the state.    Â     d. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Increase the awareness of homeless Issues at state and local government agencies and local organizations that provide services to people who are homeless, and promote training for employees to better serve people who are homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless.    Â     e. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   Promote interagency cooperation in distributing public information, both to educate the general public about the needs of the homeless and to provide homeless people and service providers with current information about available resources.    Â     6. This order shall take effect immediately.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  I have hereunto    set my hand and caused the seal of the State    of Washington to be affixed at Olympia    this 23rd day of February A.D., Nineteen hundred and ninety-one.

This fiscal note contains 7 pages.    FISCAL ANALYSIS        ASSUMPTION      Officials from the  Office of Prosecution Services, Department of Health,  and  Department of Public Safety - Missouri Highway Patrol  have assumed for similar proposals from this session that this proposal will not fiscally affect their agencies.        Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA)  stated there may be some increase in the number of cases filed, but the OSCA would not anticipate a significant impact on the workload of the judiciary.      Officials from the  Office of State Public Defender (SPD)   have responded to similar proposals from this session and  stated that in FY 99, the SPD provided representation in 507 cases of endangering the welfare of a child for indigent clients.  If just 20 % of these cases could be filed as child assault cases, then approximately 100 cases would move from a D felony to an A or B felony.  As the severity of a case escalates, the amount of attorney time required to provide representation also escalates.  The SPD assumes they will need one-half of an  FTE for an Assistant Public Defender ($33,360) and one-quarter of an FTE for a Paralegal ($23,112).  The new FTE would require the necessary expense and equipment items as well.      Oversight  assumes that the SPD could hire one additional Assistant Public Defender to handle the increased workload resulting from enactment of this proposal.  Oversight has removed the rental costs from the fiscal estimate provided by the Office of State Public Defender.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Legal Services (DLS)  assume this proposal requires the local child fatality review panel to review all deaths of children that meet guidelines set by the Department of Social Services.  Local child fatality review panels currently have guidelines as to which deaths to review and are trained to use the guidelines.  Additionally, the panel has discretion to review any child death reported to it by the medical examiner or coroner.  Some local child fatality review panels currently review all deaths in their county.      The DLS stated the proposal differentiates, in child fatality cases, whether a medical examiner/coroner or the child's personal physician shall notify the Division of Family Services within 24 hours.  The DFS is currently taking information on child fatalities.  The proposal modifies the time frame as to when the Division of Family Services is contacted.  The proposal also add reports of child pornography to be investigated, along with other reports alleging criminal violations on a child.  The Division of Family Services already investigates reports of     child pornography.          ASSUMPTION  (continued)      The proposal modifies expungement criteria and time frame in reports where Division of Family Services finds insufficient evidence.  The Division of Family Services is to maintain reports concluded with insufficient evidence for 10 years form the date of the report or date of last report if there were subsequent reports.  The electronic storage of data will be addressed by the Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing.      The proposal includes child physical abuse, neglect, exploitation and fatalities along with child sexual abuse, within the purview of the State Technical Assistance Team (STAT).  The proposal requires the STAT investigators to have proper training for peace officers.  STAT investigators currently meet this training requirement and receive continuing education.      The DLS stated there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DLS contained in the proposal.  Current resources will continued to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services (DFS)  stated    there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DFS contained in this proposal.  Current resources will continue to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing (DDP)  the DDP stated the child abuse system currently uses 2,300 cylinders for record retention.  The DDP estimates the provisions of this legislation would require an additional 9,200 cylinders of disk storage (8 gigabytes) for 10 year retention.  Costs were estimated at $3,445, $4,258, and $4,386 for FY 01, FY 02, and FY 03, respectively for the additional computer storage space.  The costs were charged to the General Revenue Fund.      Officials from the  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education  (DESE)   assume this proposal will not fiscally affect their agency.   The DESE went on to state that local multi-disciplinary teams  conducting investigations are now to include a liaison of the local public school district.  It is assumed that most school districts will be able to accommodate this provision with existing staff.      However, the proposal will affect the local school districts by an unknown amount expected to exceed $100,000 annually for Internet filtering software.   The DESE estimates that there are 140,286 computers around Missouri school districts with Internet connectivity.  Forty-two (42%) percent of districts report using filtering software on 85% of their computers.  The distribution of these computers across the districts is not known.  Filtering software ranges in cost from $0 to $25.  Additionally, software prices and capabilities vary according to the target age level.                ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Given this information, DESE believes the cost of this proposal would be significant, and in excess of $100,000.  The DESE does not believe there is enough information available to construct a specific cost estimate.   Oversight  will reflect unknown costs exceeding $100,000 annually for local school district funds.        Oversight  will also reflect unknown costs (not expected to exceed $100,000 annually) to the local library districts if they should choose to buy Internet filtering software.  The proposal gives the local public libraries the option to buy the software or to set policy regarding Internet access.  Oversight will also include the possibility of costs to local city and county governments, which operate public libraries, should the libraries choose to install Internet filtering software.      Officials from the  Department of Corrections (DOC)  have responded to similar proposals from this session that they could not predict the number of new commitments which could result from the creation of the offense(s) outlined in this proposal.  An increase in commitments would depend on the utilization by prosecutors and the actual sentences imposed by the court. If additional persons were sentenced to the custody of the DOC due to the provisions of this legislation, the DOC would incur a corresponding increase in operational costs either through incarceration (at least $35.00 per inmate, per day) or through supervision provided by the Board of Probation and Parole (at least $3.00 per offender, per day).        Due to the wide variance of newly created crimes and punishments, the fiscal impact as it relates to the DOC is unknown.      The DOC anticipates that new beds might have to be constructed to accommodate the number of offenders receiving longer sentences due to this proposal.  At this time, the DOC is unable to     determine the number of people that would be convicted under the provisions of this proposal to estimate the fiscal impact for additional capital improvements.        Estimated construction cost for one new maximum security inmate bed is $48,800.      Oversight  assumes the proposal could result in more offenders being incarcerated or placed on probation.  Additional costs for supervision and care by the DOC, although unknown, would     likely exceed $100,000 annually.                      ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Oversight  notes the proposal requires the local Child Fatality Review Panels to investigate all deaths, which meet the DOSS guidelines for review, of children under the age of 18.  The Department of Health - Bureau of Vital Statistics reports that during 1998, there were 1,035 deaths of persons under the age of 18 in the state.  The breakdown of deaths of persons under the age of 18 is as follows:      0 to 1 years old     - 573 deaths    1 to 4 years old     - 112    5 to 9 years old     -   77    10 to 14 years old - 101    15 to 17 years old -  172      Total deaths       1,035      Oversight cannot predict the number of deaths of persons under the age of 18 the local child fatality review teams will choose to investigate.  However, it would be reasonable to assume some deaths of children will now be reviewed that would not have been reviewed prior to enactment of this proposal.  The requirements of this proposal should not cause the local officials involved in the child fatality review boards to hire additional personnel, however, miscellaneous costs could increase.  These local government costs are unknown, but not expected to exceed $100,000 annually.        FISCAL IMPACT - State Government   FY 2001    (10 Mo.)

This fiscal note contains 11 pages.    FISCAL ANALYSIS        ASSUMPTION      Officials from the  Office of Prosecution Services, Department of Health,  and  Department of Public Safety - Missouri Highway Patrol  have assumed for similar proposals from this session that this proposal will not fiscally affect their agencies.        Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA)  stated there may be some increase in the number of cases filed, but the OSCA would not anticipate a significant impact on the workload of the judiciary.      Officials from the  Office of State Public Defender (SPD)   have responded to similar proposals from this session and  stated that in FY 99, the SPD provided representation in 507 cases of endangering the welfare of a child for indigent clients.  If just 20 % of these cases could be filed as child assault cases, then approximately 100 cases would move from a D felony to an A or B felony.  As the severity of a case escalates, the amount of attorney time required to provide representation also escalates.  The SPD assumes they will need one-half of an  FTE for an Assistant Public Defender ($33,360) and one-quarter of an FTE for a Paralegal ($23,112).  The new FTE would require the necessary expense and equipment items as well.      Oversight  assumes that the SPD could hire one additional Assistant Public Defender to handle the increased workload resulting from enactment of this proposal.  Oversight has removed the rental costs from the fiscal estimate provided by the Office of State Public Defender.      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Legal Services (DLS)  assume this proposal requires the local child fatality review panel to review all deaths of children that meet guidelines set by the Department of Social Services.  Local child fatality review panels currently have guidelines as to which deaths to review and are trained to use the guidelines.  Additionally, the panel has discretion to review any child death reported to it by the medical examiner or coroner.  Some local child fatality review panels currently review all deaths in their county.      The DLS stated the proposal differentiates, in child fatality cases, whether a medical examiner/coroner or the child's personal physician shall notify the Division of Family Services within 24 hours.  The DFS is currently taking information on child fatalities.  The proposal modifies the time frame as to when the Division of Family Services is contacted.  The proposal also add reports of child pornography to be investigated, along with other reports alleging criminal violations on a child.  The Division of Family Services already investigates reports of     child pornography.

The Division of Family Services is to maintain reports concluded with insufficient evidence for 10 years form the date of the report or date of last report if there were subsequent reports.  The electronic storage of data will be addressed by the Department of Social Services - Division of Data Processing.

The requirements of this proposal should not cause the local officials involved in the child fatality review boards to hire additional personnel, however, miscellaneous costs could increase.  These local government costs are unknown, but not expected to exceed $100,000 annually.      Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services (DFS)  stated    there is no programmatic or fiscal impact to the DFS contained in this proposal.  Current resources will continue to be utilized to meet the statutory requirements.      Oversight  assumes significant costs will be incurred at the local level to conduct hotline evaluations, investigations, and assessment within Jackson County; report quarterly to the director of the division of family services; conduct an annual review of the community standards, procedures and protocols established by the response team; and produce an annual report.  These unknown costs will likely exceed $100,000; however, the statutory authority for the response team will cease on December 31, 2005.      Public School and Library Internet Access      Officials from the  Office of State Courts Administrator  assume the proposal would result in no fiscal impact to the agency.             ASSUMPTION  (continued)      Officials from the  Missouri River Regional Library  assume they would need one FTE Network Assistant ($46,000) and one FTE Library Assistant ($21,804).  They would need equipment costing approximately $30,000 annually.  They also estimate needing web site registrations, database licensing and filtering software costing approximately $125,000 annually.        Officials from the  Daniel Boone Regional Library  assume the proposal would result in personnel costs of approximately $150,000 annually; capital improvements of approximately $72,000 in FY 2001; and computer software and supplies of $43,000 in FY 2001 and approximately $9,000 annually in subsequent fiscal years.      Officials from the  Secretary of State's Office (SOS)  state Section 181.020(4), RSMo, directs the Missouri State Library to ""furnish information and counsel as to the best means of establishing and maintaining libraries, selection of materials, cataloging, and other details of library management.""  To that end, the State Library employs staff within the Library Development Division to carry out this function.  Library Development staff provide assistance     through one on one consultation and training sessions.  It is estimated that questions from public library directors, trustees, and those maintaining the software on library computers would require the services of the equivalent of .5 FTE.  Personnel costs for .5 FTE ($18,240) Library Consultant are based on budget rate for the position.  Salary increases are projected at 4%.  Expense and Equipment calculations are $3,352 per each new .5 FTE.  The  Oversight Division  used salaries increases of 2.5% in the fiscal impact.      SOS officials state it would not be possible to project a total cost of public libraries to install filtering software.  Costs for filtering software vary widely by vendor and type, number of computer stations, and whether the software is installed on each ""client"" computer workstation or on a central server.  The web pages of a sampling of filtering software vendors indicate approximate annual costs in the following ranges: $150 for a site with 5 computers; $500 to $800 for 25 computers; and up to $2,500 or more for a site with 125 computers.  Several large library systems with many branches would have 100 or more computer stations requiring filtering software.  Libraries choosing to install the filtering software on a server could also need to purchase suitable equipment for the installation.  SOS officials also assume public libraries could have additional staff costs due to the legislation.  Staff time required for installation and maintenance of filtering software could be significant.  If all terminals have filtering software,     requests from adults for access to unfiltered sites might require assistance from library staff.  Requests to have sites unblocked would be processed individually, and could require individual adjustments of the software.  Library staff would also have to monitor the use of the computer workstation, to ensure the filtering software is active when the workstation is used by minors.  Library technical services staff would also need to spend considerable amounts of time, at least initially, checking to see that the filtering software did not block access to sites the library did not wish to block.          ASSUMPTION  (continued)      The proposal would require the SOS to establish rules and regulations for enforcement.  The estimated cost of a page in the Missouri Register is $22.50.  The estimated cost of a page in the Code of State Regulations is $26.50.  The actual costs could be more or less than the number given.  The impact of this legislation in future years is unknown and depends upon the frequency and length of rules, filed, amended, rescinded or withdrawn.        Officials from the  Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE)  assume the proposal would result in no direct fiscal impact to DESE.  At the local school district level, DESE assumes the following:      1)  140,286 computers in Missouri school districts with internet connectivity.     2)  42% of districts report using filtering software on 85% of their computers.      3)  The distribution of these computers across districts is not known.      4)  Filtering software ranges in cost from $0 to $25.  Additionally, software prices and capabilities vary according to the target age level.        Given this information, DESE believes the cost of this legislation would be significant, i.e., in excess of $100,000; however, DESE does not feel there is enough information available to construct a specific estimate.      Jefferson County Child Assessment Center      Officials from the  Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services - Children's Services Section  stated this proposal would have a fiscal impact to the Department in that an additional $250,000 would be required to bring the proposed Child Assessment Center (CAC) to the level of the CAC's currently receiving funding through the Department.

DESCRIPTION      This proposal makes various changes to the statutes regarding child abuse and neglect, child pornography, Internet access in public and private schools and public libraries.      This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and may require additional capital improvements or rental space.      Public School and Library Internet Access              The proposal would require public schools and public libraries which provide a public access computer to equip the computers with software that seeks to prevent minors from gaining access to material that is harmful to minors or purchase Internet connectivity from an Internet service provider that provides filter services to limit access to material harmful to minors.        Public libraries would be required to develop and implement by January 1, 2001, a policy that establishes measures to restrict minors from gaining computer access to material that is harmful to minors.        The Secretary of State would be required to establish rules and regulations for the enforcement of the requirements.       This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and would not require additional capital improvements or rental space.      Jefferson County Child Assessment Center      This proposal adds the Jefferson County Child Assessment Center to the list of child assessment centers eligible to receive funding from the Department of Social Services - Division of Family Services.      This legislation is not federally mandated, would not duplicate any other program and would not require additional capital improvements or rental space.      Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team      Section 1 of the proposal would create a pilot project to be known as the ""Jackson County Child Abuse and Neglect Response Team"".

A household paying more than 30 percent of their total income towards their    rent or mortgage is considered to be cost burdened. A household paying more    than 50 percent of their income towards their rent or mortgage is considered    to be severely cost burdened.    The following discussion analyzes the housing problems and assistance needs    of households by various income groupings. For purposes of the discussion below,    a household with a housing problem is described as:        Occupying a housing unit that meets the U.S. Census definition of having      a physical defect ( lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);      Overcrowded (more than one person per room living in a unit); and/or,      Cost burdened.      Low Income   The ""low income"" designation applies to those households whose incomes are    at or below 50 percent of the adjusted family median income ( incomes are adjusted    for family size). It is estimated by the Maricopa Association of Governments    (MAG) year 2000 planning update that 79,267 households or 80% of the 98,654    low income households in Phoenix had a housing problem. Of the 79,267 households,    41,110 low income renters and 38,157 low income homeowners were paying more    than 30 percent of their income for housing costs. Cost burdened low income    households can be further identified by household type: elderly, small family,    large family, and all others. Of the 41,110 cost burdened low income renters    5,168 were elderly households, 15,683 were small families, 6,465 were large    families and the remaining 13,794 households in the ""other"" category.    The data derived from the 1990 census and projected to the year 2000 by MAG,    the Maricopa Association of Governments, allows for analysis of the housing    problems of households earning below 30 percent of the adjusted family median    income. Of the 79,267 low income occupied households in Phoenix:       43%, or 34,085 households, earned less than 30% of median.      Of the 34,085 households 78%, or 26,586 households, had one or more housing      problem.      77%, or 26,245 households, were estimated to be cost burdened.      While 65%, or 22,155 households, were severely cost burdened.       Of the 26,245 households considered to be cost burdened rental or owner occupied    households, 80 %, or 20,996 households, were estimated to be actually paying    greater than 50% of their income on rent and utilities for the year 2000.   Overcrowding    The degree of overcrowding among low income renter households is 19.4 percent    within the 0 to 30 percent of median income group and 16.9 percent among the    31 to 50 percent of median income group. Of large family renters in the 0 to    30 percent income group, 79.3 percent live in overcrowded conditions and 71.5    percent of the large family renters in the 31 to 50 percent income group live    in overcrowded conditions.     Overcrowding among low income owner households in Phoenix is not as high as    with low income renter households. At the time of the 1990 census, only 6.1    percent of all owners earning 0 to 30 percent of adjusted median income were    considered overcrowded. A total of 7.6 percent of owners earning 31 to 50 percent    of adjusted median income were overcrowded. However, if low income elderly homeowners    were not counted as part of the calculation, the number of overcrowded owner    households would increase to 12.3 percent and 14.7 percent for the respective    income categories.   Disproportionate Need    Disproportionate need is defined as one racial or ethnic group displaying    a noticeably greater need for housing assistance than the population has a whole.    For purposes of the CP, a difference of 10 percent in housing needs data between    the population as a whole and minority population is an indicator of disproportionate    need.    Based on the 1990 census data and available year 2000 projections, there were    no instances of assistance needs being disproportionately greater for minority    populations among the low income group. The year 2000 projection does indicate    an overall increase in the Hispanic population by 28% making this the largest    single ethnic group growth. The greatest disparities were:        Minority owners within the 31 to 50 percent median income bracket had 70      percent of housing problems compared to 63 percent for the population as a      whole ( Hispanic owner households at 71 percent have the greatest incidents      of housing problems); and,           Black elderly owners within the 31 to 50 percent median income bracket had      65 percent of housing problems compared to 59 percent for the population as      a whole.       Notably there were several areas where minorities had lesser incidents of    housing problems than the population as a whole.    It should be noted that housing conditions are not being adequately accounted    for in the Census data and therefore, not represented statistically to the degree    of actual housing problems that are faced by the minority population in Phoenix.    It is known that a relatively greater proportion of the minority population    resides in the older sections of Phoenix and for that reason, undoubtedly faced    a greater incidence of substandard housing. The 1994 City of Phoenix Housing    Condition Evaluation projected that of the 426,307 housing units evaluated;    122,540 dwelling units needed minor repairs; 9,013 units needed major repairs;    and 2,575 units were not feasible to repair.    Moderate Income    The ""moderate income"" designation applies to those households whose incomes    are greater than 50 percent but less than or equal to 80 percent of the adjusted    family median income. It is estimated through MAG year 2000 projections that    40,927 households, or 50 percent, of the 81,822 moderate income households in    Phoenix had some sort of housing problem. It is estimated that16,472 moderate    income renters and 17,881 moderate income homeowners were paying more than 30    percent of their income towards their rent (cost burdened). Of the 16,472 cost    burdened moderate income renters, 2,249 were elderly households, 6,275 were    small families, 1,225 large families and the remaining 7,723 were in the ""Other""    category. Only 4 percent of moderate income renter households and 7 percent    of moderate income owner households were considered severely cost burdened.    There continues to be a significant difference when compared to low income households    as noted previously.   Overcrowding    The degree of overcrowding among the renter households is 12.5 percent within    the 51 to 80 percent of median income group. Of large family renters in the    51 to 80 percent income group, 61.9 percent are overcrowded. Overcrowding among    moderate income owner households is 6.3%. These figures, according to the 1990    census are still within year 2000 projections. Overcrowding among moderate income    owner households (6.3%) is on par with other Arizona cities.    Disproportionate Need    There were no instances of assistance needs being disproportionately greater    for minority populations among the moderate income group. The following are    the most disparate incidents in this income group:        Minority owners within the 51 to 80 percent median income bracket had a      55 percent incident of housing problems compared to 50 percent for the population      as a whole (black owner households had a 57 percent incidents of housing problems);      and,               Hispanic renter households within the 51 to 80 percent median income bracket      had a 63 percent incident of housing problems compared to 50 percent for the      population as a whole.      Middle Income    The ""middle income"" designation applies to those house holds whose incomes    are greater than 80 percent but less than or equal to 95 percent of the adjusted    family median income. Year 2000 projections indicate 9,975 households, or 27    percent, of the 36,591 middle income households had some sort of housing problem.    Of this number, 1,903 middle income renters and 7,049 middle income homeowners    were paying more than 30 percent of their income towards their rent (cost burdened).    Of the 1,903 cost burdened middle income renters, 260 are estimated to be elderly    households, 925 small families, 103 large families and the remaining 615 were    in the ""Other"" category. The incidence of severely cost burdened middle income    households is still projected to be negligible in the year 2000 as it was in    the 1990 Census. There was insufficient data available to discuss overcrowding    and disproportionate need within the middle income category.   Trends    An indicator of housing need can be derived from the waiting lists for assisted    housing in Phoenix. The public housing and Section 8 waiting lists are continuously    open. As of February 2000, there were a total of 15,321 households on waiting    lists for assisted housing. There were 1,490 households on the waiting lists    for public housing, 767 for elderly housing, 262 for the scattered sites homeownership    program and 12,802 for the Section 8 rental voucher program.     The City's public and Section 8 housing inventories consist of:       1,776 conventional public housing units with an annual 32% turnover rate         636 elderly housing units with an annual 13% turnover rate      456 scattered site single family homes with an annual 24% turnover rate         4,191 Section 8 vouchers with an annual 6% turnover rate       Based on the competition for the City's assisted housing units, a household    may be on a waiting list from a few months to several years depending on the    type of housing and program desired. The City has established local preferences    for public and Section 8 housing. The local preferences are given to families    that:        Are working and to those unable to work because of age or disability      Residents who live and/or work in the jurisdiction      Families displaced through City of Phoenix action or are referred from the      Maricopa County Attorney Victim Witness Program       The table below illustrates the number of households on the waiting list for    public housing and Section 8 vouchers as of February, 2000 in need of assisted    housing by number of bedrooms required:                                                                                         Bedroom Size                                              Households                                                                       1                                              4,963                                                                       2                                              10,745                                                                       3                                              8,575                                                                       4                                              2,553                                                                       5                                              194                                                                                The assisted housing waiting lists indicate that there is a greater need of    housing for small families (2 to 4 persons). Approximately 5% (767) of the total    households on the lists are elderly or disabled households.     Affordability of single family housing is an increasing issue within the housing    market. According to the Arizona State University's Real Estate Center a household    would have to make over $45,000 to afford the median priced home in 1999 ($129,900).    When half of Arizona households make less than $35,000, the increasing affordability    problem becomes clear. The percent of households who can afford the median value    home has declined from 65% in 1970 to an estimated 35% in 1999.

This data table is used only as a guide to demonstrate housing    needs. The data developed in the Consolidated Plan is generally more current    than 1990 Census information.    Current Estimates and Five-Year Projections    The Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) population and housing projections    were utilized to update the 1990 Census data as well as the 1995 special Census.    From this, a current estimate of rental subsidy need was made. It was also used    to project rental estimates and projections. The ratios between rental households    in need, by household type, to total households derived from the 1990 Census    were assumed to remain the same in estimating the current need and the five    year projected need. Through this process it was projected that the total rental    subsidy need for low income households will increase by 5,703 households over    the next five years.

The low and moderate income populations          in Phoenix increases at about a rate of 2% per year based on this ten          year overview.      Homeless Population   Homelessness    The Nature and Extent of Homelessness    Homeless people in Phoenix reflect the diversity, complex characteristics,    and special needs of all homeless people in the United States. Despite their    diversity, almost all homeless people are extremely poor. Regardless of their    other difficulties, the lack of basic needs (housing, food, clothing, medical    care) are common to all homeless people. Some homeless people require limited    assistance in order to regain permanent housing and self-sufficiency. Others,    especially people with physical or mental disabilities, require extensive and    long-term support.    The definition of ""homelessness"" used in this Consolidated Plan is derived    from the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. According to this definition,    a person is considered homeless who:        Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence; or,      Has a primary night-time residency that is a:      Supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary      living accommodations;     An institution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended      to be institutionalized; or,      A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular      sleeping accommodation for human beings.       The term ""homeless individual"" does not include any individual imprisoned    or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a state law.    The State Homeless Coordination Office estimates, on any given night, there    are as many as 12,000 people living on the streets or in emergency or transitional    shelters in Maricopa County. The State Homeless Coordination Office conducted    a statewide point-in-time survey of emergency and transitional shelters in July    1998. On the night of the survey, 3,454 homeless people were counted in Maricopa    County shelters. Of this number 1,610 were individuals and 1,844 indicated they    were members of a family. The State Homeless Coordination Office reports approximately    6,000 individuals and 2,000 persons in families remain unsheltered in Maricopa    County each night.    Based on findings from outreach worker estimates, shelters, transitional housing    programs and service providers in Phoenix and supported by national studies,    the subcommittee working on updating the Maricopa Association of Governments    Homeless Plan has estimates the homeless population in Maricopa County is comprised    of the following subpopulations:     Thirty-three percent of the homeless population consists of    people in families with children with the following characteristics:       One-third are homeless because of poverty issues only;      Thirty percent have substance abuse issues;      Thirty percent are experiencing domestic violence;      Three percent have an adult family member with a serious mental illness;         Three percent have an adult with a dual diagnosis of substance abuse and      serious mental illness:      One percent has a member who has HIV/AIDS.       In January 1998, seven emergency shelters and transitional housing programs    in Phoenix participated in a national survey of family homelessness coordinated    by Homes for the Homeless and The Institute for Children and Poverty in New    York City. The final report, ""HOMELESS IN AMERICA: A CHILDREN'S STORY"" was published    in 1999. It contained data obtained by over 200 organizations in twenty cities    in the United States. The results of the survey includes the following national    data and data obtained in Phoenix:                                                                                          AGE/ETHNICITY                                               PHOENIX                                               NATIONALLY                                                                        < 5 Years                                              41%                                              49%                                                                        5 to 17 Years                                              59%                                              52%                                                                        African American                                              27%                                              63%                                                                        Asian                                              0%                                              1%                                                                        Latino                                              23%                                              13%                                                                        Native American                                              10%                                              2%                                                                        White                                              38%                                              16%                                                               Â                                                                      Times Homeless:                                                        FREQUENCY                                         PHOENIX                                         NATIONALLY                                                              Once                                        58%                                        73%                                                              Twice or More                                        42%                                        27%                                                              Witnessed DV                                        51%                                        40%                                                              Witnessed Com.

The average rental rates in Phoenix are: $472 for a one-bedroom apartment, $503    for a two-bedroom apartment, and $894 for a three-bedroom apartment. The HUD    standard for determining appropriate rents is that no more than 30% of a household's    income should be spent on housing costs (including utilities). The household,    which earns $1,120 (based on $7/hour full-time employment), should be paying    $336/month for rent and utilities.      Poverty    The Maricopa County Association of Governments has estimated at least one-third    of the families with children in Maricopa County live at or below the Federal    Poverty Level. The Children's Defense Fund has estimated that, on a national    basis, one in five families in our country live in poverty. A single female    heads most homeless families in Maricopa County. Of these families, the 1990    Census found thirty-three percent live in poverty. The 1990 Census also determined    that 51% of single female parent families with children under five years of    age live in poverty.      Inadequate Community Support for People with Disabilities   1. People with Addictions to Alcohol and/or Other Substances      The abuse and/or addiction to alcohol or other substances typically leads    to major impairment of the ability to function on a day-to-day basis, including    maintaining employment, acceptable family and social interaction. If the abuser    cannot attain or maintain abstinence, family, social, and employment supports    are usually withdrawn at some point. In many cases, one of the results is loss    of housing. The nature of recovery from addictions has been found to likely    include relapses. Most homeless shelters do not allow residents to actively    use alcohol or other substances and therefore many people remain unhoused. When    a person in a shelter relapses, they are evicted and return to living on the    streets.    The most prevalent population includes people who abuse various types of substances.    In responses to survey questions in ""A Snapshot of Homeless People in Phoenix,""    a 1996 survey of homeless people in Phoenix (Morrison Institute for Public Policy,    Arizona State University), 36 percent of the respondents reported abusing alcohol    or other drugs during the previous twelve months. Outreach workers for the regional    behavioral health system estimate between 75 and 80 percent of all unsheltered    single people are suffering from substance abuse. Based on the State Homeless    Coordination Office's July 1998 survey of homeless shelter providers, over 36    percent of homeless adults in families were dealing with substance abuse problems    on the survey night. It is estimated that approximately 5,900 homeless persons    in Maricopa County have substance abuse problems.   2. People with a Serious Mental Illness    Without adequate support, people with serious mental illnesses often stop    taking medication needed to remain stable. When decompensation occurs, and support    is not available, many people with a serious mental illness leave housing, on    their own or through eviction. People with serious mental illnesses are usually    afraid to enter large mass shelters. Most shelters do not have adequate staff    to offer special assistance needed by the seriously mentally ill population.    If in a shelter, people with a serious mental illness that are not taking their    medication, often have difficulty following shelter rules and are evicted.    According to a 1992 National Institute of Mental Health report, an estimated    30 percent of all single homeless adults are seriously mentally ill. The Arizona    Department of Health Services estimates approximately 15 percent of homeless    persons are dually diagnosed as seriously mentally ill and substance abusing.    When these percentages are applied to the homeless population in Maricopa County,    potentially 1,094 homeless individuals are afflicted with a serious mental illness    only. Another 1,137 homeless people could be dually diagnosed with a mental    illness and substance abuse problem. During the State Homeless Coordination    Office's survey of shelters in Maricopa County in July 1998, of the estimated    12,000 homeless 6% or 720 persons could be dually diagnosed and 7% or 840 persons    could be diagnosed having a serious mental illness.     3. People with HIV/AIDS    The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has concluded, by the year    2000, Maricopa County will have 6,000 reported cases of AIDS. Estimates indicate    4,000 deaths will have occurred and 15,400 persons in Maricopa County will be    living with HIV or AIDS. ADHS also reports persons living with AIDS, in the    future, will be more likely to be people of color and less likely to be homosexual    men. Instead, they will more likely have some histories of Intravenous Drug    Use (IDU) and be women. According to a 1992 National Commission on AIDS report,    approximately 15 percent of homeless single people are HIV/AIDS-infected. A    1995 HIV Consumer Survey conducted by the Arizona AIDS Foundation found 16 percent    of persons in Maricopa County with HIV/AIDS were living on the streets, in a    shelter, or in a treatment center.      People Experiencing the Effects of Trauma    It is estimated that at least half of the women experiencing homelessness    are, or have been, victims of abuse, either as an adult or as a child. In many    cases, homeless youth leave home to escape problems such as physical and sexual    abuse, drug abuse by parents, and severe family conflict. The effects of domestic    violence and other trauma result in severe anxiety and depression, poor health    and nutrition, and low self-esteem.    1. People Who are Victims of Domestic Violence    According to the 1998 State Homeless Coordination Office's point-in-time survey    of shelters, approximately 19 percent of the sheltered family population were    in shelters because they were victims of domestic violence. In addition, the     1997 Arizona Uniform Family Violence Program Report  indicated over 14,397 requests    for service were turned down from domestic violence shelters because of lack    of space. The eight domestic violence shelters in Maricopa County reported providing    50,561 bed nights of shelter last year to about 2,721 women and their children.    During intake, 543 victims reported they had called the police for assistance    during the most recent incidence of domestic violence. It was also reported    95 percent of the perpetrators were arrested for a domestic violence incident.    Service providers and advocates estimate 50 percent of all homeless women have    left their households because of domestic violence.     2. Homeless Youth     Nowhere To Go, A Report on Runaway and Homeless Youth in Arizona  estimates    the total number of runaway and homeless youth in Arizona to be 5,000 each year.    Youth advocates estimate that up to 58 percent, or 2,900 of these youth, reside    in Maricopa County during the course of a year and up to 670 at any point in    time. The Children's Action Alliance estimates that shelters in Arizona turned    away about 4,300 requests for shelter by homeless youth in 1998. There are only    69 emergency beds available throughout Arizona for youth on their own, eight    of which are in Maricopa County. In 1996, 7,831 youth were arrested in Arizona    for running away from home. This number represents a 51% increase in arrests    from 1990.    According to the National Network for Youth and the National Coalition for    the Homeless, an estimated 46% of homeless youth have been physically abused,    and 17% have experienced unwanted sexual activity by a family or household member.    An estimated 66% report having an alcoholic parent. These sources also indicate    youth may become homeless when their families suffer financial crises resulting    from lack of affordable housing, limited employment opportunities, insufficient    wages, no medical insurance, or inadequate welfare benefits. These youth become    homeless with their families, but are late separated from them by shelter, transitional    housing, or child welfare policies. A very high percentage of homeless youth    have had previous institutional placements, as much as twenty percent of youth    arriving at federally funded shelters were previously placed in the last year.     Barriers to Ending Homelessness in Phoenix     Housing is not affordable to people with low incomes . The U.S. Department    of Housing and Urban Development has reported that between 1995 and 1997, rents    increased faster than income for the 20% of people with the lowest incomes in    the nation. The waiting time for subsidized housing in Phoenix is about 56 months.     Low wages and changes in the welfare system have left many families living    in poverty and unable to afford housing . The dollar amount received from    current family welfare benefits (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families - TANF)    and Food Stamps combined give families income, which places them at the Federal    Poverty level. Welfare does not end poverty. Since November 1997, over 12,000    families in Arizona reached the two-year time limit for receiving TANF. Although    moving from ""welfare to work"", most families are earning minimum wage, they    are still living in poverty.    Because of low wages many families struggle to obtain childcare, medical care,    food, and housing. With little income for these necessities, families are in    imminent danger of becoming homeless. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Housing    and Urban Development reported that families with children represented 40% of    the households who are paying more than half of their income for housing or    live in substandard housing. In Fiscal Year 1998-99, the five City of Phoenix    Family Services Centers provided crisis assistance to over 25,000 low-income    families. Without this homeless prevention intervention, many of these families    would have lost their housing.     Homeless people, scattered throughout Maricopa County, have difficulty    learning about and accessing services . Although very visible, the downtown    homeless population represents only a small percentage of the homeless population    in Maricopa County. People in outlying areas aren't aware of assistance or lack    transportation to get assistance. Outreach teams must cover a 9,200 square mile    area in order to reach all of the homeless people in Maricopa County.     Because of funding source restrictions, emergency shelter in Arizona is    only provided to families for up to 3 months during a one-year period . This    means a family can usually stay in only one shelter during the year. If a family    ""does not make it"" at a shelter, they usually return to living on the streets.    Three months is not adequate time to stabilize crisis situations, especially    for chronically homeless families with substance abuse, mental health, life    skills, and employment problems. Many homeless families exiting emergency shelters    do not meet the requirements of transitional housing programs because of lack    of preparation and therefore return to living on the streets.     Safe, decent housing is not affordable for people recovering from homelessness .    Receipt of affordable housing is the single greatest predictor of formerly homeless    persons' ability to remain in housing (Practical Lessons, the 1998 National    Symposium on Homelessness Research, August 1999). People making minimum wages,    especially if they have children, cannot afford deposits and ongoing rental    fees for market rate housing. People living in emergency shelters and transitional    housing programs are required to save money. When they access permanent housing    that is not affordable for them , they are at great risk of recidivism to homelessness    when they run out of savings, experience a crisis, or make a bad decision.    Many homeless people have credit problems and/or criminal records. Most rental    housing will not accept people with a criminal or bad credit history. City of    Phoenix operated housing programs also uses this restriction. The results are    families live doubled up, live in substandard housing, or return to the streets.    Most rental properties require a $25 fee for a credit check. Most homeless people    don't have the money to comply with this requirement. These fees are non-refundable    and have to be paid at each property. Results are families live doubled up,    live in substandard housing, or return to the streets.      The behavioral health system in Maricopa County does not have enough funding    to provide adequate housing and services to the seriously mentally ill population    in Maricopa County . ComCare, the previous Regional Behavioral Health Authority    (RBHA) in Maricopa County estimated there are at least 1,000 homeless seriously    mentally ill people living without housing in the county. Value Options, the    new RBHA, says there are 12,000 people with a serious mental illness in Maricopa    County. They have about 1,000 Shelter + Care or Supportive Housing Program vouchers.       Alcohol and drug abuse treatment is almost nonexistent for homeless people .    Almost all treatment programs are only available to people who have private    insurance coverage, to those who are low income and can pay their portion of    treatment based on income, or who have Arizona Health Care Cost Containment    System (AHCCCS) coverage. Most homeless people have jobs that don't have insurance    as a benefit, or they have zero income, or on AHCCCS because of another disability.    AHCCCS pays for two weeks of treatment.      Monitoring     The Human Services Department performs financial and programmatic monitoring    of all City contracts directed toward assistance for the homeless. The monitoring    process is initiated through a financial desk audit. Each agency completes a    questionnaire regarding internal fiscal policies/procedures and submits back-up    documentation to support a randomly selected monthly expenditure request previously    submitted for reimbursement from the Human Services Department.    An on-site monitoring visit is then made to each agency. The purpose of the    visit is to verify that the Statement of Work for each contract is carried out    according to the contract's provisions. The verification includes interviews    with appropriate fiscal and programmatic agency staff, review of case records,    and inspection of other relevant agency documents. Technical assistance is provided    by the Human Services Department in regard to any findings from the monitoring    or other issues identified by the contractor.    A written report is made for each monitoring. The report includes applicable    findings of compliance and non-compliance with contract requirements. If non-compliance    is found, each incident is identified as a ""Corrective Action"" in the report.    A Corrective Action must be rectified within a specified time frame. Consequences    of not making a correction can include future contract payments to termination    of the contract. The report also identifies ""Recommendations"" for improving    procedures, policies, or activities related to administering or providing the    contracted services. Each monitoring report and correspondence about follow-up    activities are sent to HUD's Phoenix Community Planning and Development Office.       LEAD BASED PAINT     Lead poisoning affects children of every demographic group. Low income families,    however, are disproportionately affected. Housing that has not been adequately    maintained is potentially the most hazardous to young children because of the    likelihood of chipping, peeling or flaking paint. Much of the older housing    stock available to low income families is in this deteriorated condition.    Lead was banned from residential paint in 1978. Housing built before 1978,    therefore, may present a lead hazard if any coat of paint contains lead. It    is not the presence of lead that causes the hazard, however, but in exposure    to the lead through dust or paint chips. Young children most frequently become    exposed by inadvertently ingesting lead containing dust through the course of    normal hand-to-mouth activities. Additionally, children are exposed to these    hazards during the remodeling or the repair or of older homes.    In 1995, 325 cases of elevated blood lead levels were reported statewide.    In 1993 there were 315 cases reported. The 1993 data indicated a 573 percent    jump over previous years, and was largely due to new mandatory screening requirements    for Medicaid-eligible children and perfected screening processes. As can be    seen between the data reported for 1995 compared with1993 the increase is statistically    minor. Of the 325 cases reported in 1995 132 were from the City of Phoenix.    The 1995 data is considered consistent with current year (1999) data available    from the Arizona Department of Health Services with 289 cases reported statewide.    The estimate is that 103 cases were from the City of Phoenix.    The City of Phoenix is committed to providing housing rehabilitation assistance    in a lead safe manner. In that spirit the City is moving rapidly to implement    the new lead hazard control regulations which resulted form section 1012 and    1013 of the Residential Lead-Based Pain Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. In 1999,    the City received its third Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant. The City    is integrating lead hazard control into all of its housing rehabilitation programs    and is working with local nonprofits to train their staff on how to do the same.    Local jurisdictions are being asked by HUD to estimate the number of housing    units within the jurisdiction that are occupied by low or moderate income families    that might contain lead based paint hazards. The information contained in this    document is based on estimates using 1990 Census and were possible augmented    by the 1995 Census update. The following HUD formula was used to extrapolate    the estimated percentage of low income housing with lead based paint.              Â        Estimated Units                 90 percent of low income housing built        pre-1940        8,300                 80 percent of low income housing built        1940 1959        53,000                 62 percent of low income housing built        1960  1979        72,000                Total       133300          As indicated by the numbers above, it is estimated that 76 percent of the    176,000 low income housing units built prior to 1980 may contain lead based    paint and, therefore, constitute a hazard under HUD guides. Because data is    unavailable to determine what percentage of these units were built prior to    1978 actually house families with young children, this assessment takes the    conservative approach that all households are risk.     The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), in the summer of 1998, conducted    a randomized door to door screening of children less than 6 years old in two    central Phoenix neighborhoods, Garfield and University Park. Garfield is one    of the Neighborhood Initiative Areas (NIC) and University Park is in the Enterprise    Community (EC). The study found that 5.2 percent of children screened had elevated    blood lead levels and that approximately 10 percent of children between the    ages of 12 and 35 months had elevated blood lead levels.          ADHS maintains a statewide lead poisoning registry, which is based on          a passive surveillance system, whereby all elevated blood lead (ebl) levels          are required to be reported by both the physician and the laboratory.          Virtually all lead screening conducted in Arizona is performed by the          state's Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System          (AHCCCS). Consequently, rates of lead poisoning among non-AHCCCS eligible          children, including the many children who have no access to health care,          are statistically absent (other than for the study noted above). It is          unknown to what extent the registry rates reflect the rates of lead poisoning          among the total child population. AHCCCS does not release personal identifiers          for non-ebl children and thus ADHS is unable to determine if the number          of children screened is an accurate number. Childhood lead poisoning prevalence          rates, using AHCCCS data, have varied significantly from year to year.          In 1994 the statewide rate was 3.75 percent and the highest rate in Phoenix          was 14.97 percent in a zip code located within the EC. In 1996, the most          recent year for which denominator data is available, the statewide rate          is 1.3 percent and the highest rate in Phoenix was 4.1 percent in the          zip code that includes Garfield, one of the LHCP target areas.
