GX017-46-1124286	Ships that become grounded on coral reefs may cause immediate and long-term damage to reefs. A grounded ship may smash hundreds of years worth of coral growth in an instant. Over time, fuel, oil, paints and other chemicals may leak from the ship, continuing to damage the fragile corals as the ship's  hull rusts in the harsh marine environment.
