Three figures with white faces and vibrantly elongated ocher bodies stride across this round stone's surface.       Documentations of South African Khoisan religious and trance practices recorded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been used to interpret not only more recent rock art but also rock paintings and engravings thousands of years old. Southern African rock paintings and engravings often combine geometric forms with images of humans and animals, in what some scholars have argued represents hallucinatory trance imagery. Although the Coldstream Stone itself does not contain references to animals or geometric patterns, some scholars have interpreted it in terms of Khoisan trance practices because of the nasal hemorrhaging of some of the figures.

Its imagery documents a verdant Sahara teeming with life that stands in stark contrast to the arid desert the region has since become. Tassili paintings and engravings, like those of other rock art areas in the Sahara, are commonly divided into at least four chronological periods based on style and content. These are: an archaic tradition depicting wild animals whose antiquity is unknown but certainly goes back well before 4500  B.C. ; a so-called bovidian tradition, which corresponds to the arrival of cattle in North Africa between 4500 and 4000  B.C. ; a ""horse"" tradition, which corresponds to the appearance of horses in the North African archaeological record from about 2000  B.C.  onward; and a ""camel"" tradition, which emerges around the time of Christ when these animals first appear in North Africa. Engravings of animals such as the extinct giant buffalo are among the earliest works, followed later by paintings in which color is used to depict humans and animals with striking naturalism. In the last period, chariots, shields, and camels appear in the rock paintings. Although close to the Iberian Peninsula, it is currently believed that the rock art of Algeria and Tassili developed independently of that in Europe.     While these traditions are successive, it does appear that earlier ones continued on for varying lengths of time after the appearance of later ones. Two important qualifiers need to be made. First, many scholars have recently questioned a pan-Saharan chronology and there is a move away from grandiose chronological schemes to concentrating more on understanding regional chronological variability. Second, the Sahara, given its vast size and various political complications, is still an inadequately researched area in terms of rock art and very few dates exist. As more work is done and techniques for dating advance, it is likely that this four-period dating scheme will be modified in particular regions and that more will be learned about the origins and demise of Saharan rock art.

The word  Afghanistan  is used to refer to that territory, even though, and especially because, it has been known by many other names throughout history.   Afghanistan's history, internal political development, foreign relations, and very existence as an independent state have largely been determined by its geographic location at the crossroads of  Central ,  West , and  South Asia . Over the centuries, waves of migrating peoples passed through the region--described by historian  Arnold Toynbee  as a ""roundabout of the ancient world""--leaving behind a mosaic of ethnic and linguistic groups. In modern times, as well as in antiquity, vast armies of the world passed through this region of Asia, temporarily establishing local control and often dominating.   Invariably, most of Afghanistan's history was spent as part of the larger events that took place upon the  Iranian plateau  as a whole. The  Aryan peoples  who arrived in Afghanistan left their languages, ( Pashto ,  Persian , etc.) and culture as a legacy.   It is perhaps not surprising that it is the Middle Eastern influence (Iranic past and Arab invasions) that has defined modern Afghanistan, while its Greek, Central Asian nomadic, and Zoroastrian/Pagan/Buddhist past have long since vanished. Although it was the scene of great empires and flourishing trade for over two millennia, the area's heterogeneous groups, with  Turkic  groups predominant in the extreme northwest and showing some connection to the mixed  Hazaras  of the central regions, were not bound into a single political entity until the reign of  Ahmed Shah Durrani , who in 1747 founded the monarchy that ruled the country until 1973. In the nineteenth century, Afghanistan lay between the expanding might of the  Russian  and  British  empires. In 1900,  Abdur Rahman Khan  (the ""Iron Amir""), after twenty years of rule, looked at the events of the past century and wondered how his country, which stood ""like a goat between these lions (Britain and Tsarist Russia) or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill, [could] stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?""   Islam  played perhaps the key role in the formation of Afghanistan's society. Despite the early thirteenth century  Mongol  invasion of what is today Afghanistan--which has been described as resembling ""more some brute cataclysm of the blind forces of nature than a phenomenon of human history,"" even a warrior as formidable as  Genghis Khan  did not uproot Islamic civilization; within two generations, his heirs had become  Muslims . Later, native Afghan empire builders such as the  Ghorids , would continue to make Afghanistan a major medieval power as well as a center of learning that produced  Ferdowsi , and  Al-Biruni  among countless other academics and literary iconic figures.

Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)       Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that early humans were living in what is now  Afghanistan  at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in Afghanistan were among the earliest in the world. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   It is not clear who the early inhabitants of Afghanistan were, though it is likely they were connected through culture and trade to neighboring civilizations like  Jiroft  and  Tappeh Sialk  and the  Indus Valley Civilization . Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of  Mundigak  (near  Kandahar ) may have been a colony of the nearby  Indus Valley Civilization .     [ edit ]   Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex   The  Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex  became prominent in the region between 2200 and 1700 BCE (approximately). The city of  Balkh  ( Bactra ) was founded about this time (ca. 2000-1500 BCE). It's possible that the  BMAC  may have been an  Indo-European  culture, perhaps the Proto- Indo-Aryans , who began their migration into India towards the end of this period.   The centuries following the end of the BMAC and the Aryan invasions are not well known due to a lack of source information.     [ edit ]   Indus Valley Civilization   The  Indus Valley Civilization  possibly became prominent in the southern and eastern parts of the region at the same time.     [ edit ]   Ancient Afghanistan, Pre-Islamic period (before 651)             Please help  improve this article or section  by expanding it.  Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)           Main article:  Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan              Ancient Afghanistan was often ruled by various Persian dynasties, such as the  Achaemenid Empire  (559330 BCE)               Alexander the Great  fighting the Persian king  Darius  ( Pompeii  mosaic, from a 4th century BCE original Greek painting, now lost).       After several centuries of darkness, history returns to find kingdoms formed in  Arachosia ,  Bactria ,  Aria , and  Gandhara . Parts of the region were controlled by the  Medean Empire  until it was overthrown in 550 BCE by their  Achaemenid  vassals. This Achaemenid  Persian Empire  soon conquered the rest of Afghanistan and ruled for over 200 years. During the 320s BCE, Afghanistan and the rest of the Persian Empire was conquered by  Alexander the Great  and became part of his empire, which empire fragmented after his death in 323 BCE as his generals fought for supremacy. A general named  Seleucus  carved out the largest  Hellenistic  kingdom, the  Seleucid Empire , which included most of Iran and Afghanistan. In 305 BCE the Seleucids gave Arachosia and Gandhara to the  Mauryan Empire  of India in return for a treaty of alliance and 500 Indian war elephants.   Bactria and Aria remained in Seleucid hands until 250 BCE, when the Bactrian Satrap  Diodotus  rebelled and established the  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom . A campaign by Seleucid King Antiochus III led to the restoration of many of the eastern provinces in the late 200s BCE.     [ edit ]   Mauryan rule to Indo-Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms          'The  Dipavamisa  and the  Mahavamsa  speak of two Maurya princes  Ashoka  and Susima , also called Sumana as being entrusted durying the reign of their father  Bindusara  with the administration of Avantirattha and  Utaparttha  respectively. [ 4 ]                 Utharpatha included Kashmir , Punjab and Afghanistan having its capital at  Taxila  in Rawalpindi district. [ 4 ]          The Mauryan Dynasty was overthrown in 185 BCE by a general named  Pusyamitra Sunga , who founded the  Sunga Dynasty . This led to war with the  Greco-Bactrian  allies of the Mauryans, led by King  Demetrius I , who quickly overran Afghanistan and the Indus region, then marched towards the Sunga capital. Suddenly a civil war broke out amongst the Greeks when a general named  Eucratides  overthrew Demetrius' brother  Antimachus I , forcing Demetrius to abandon his Indian campaign and defend his throne, but he was defeated and restricted to his newly-conquered territories in India, which became known as the  Indo-Greek Kingdom .   Greco-Bactria continued until ca. 130 BC, when Eucratides' son, King Heliocles I, was defeated and driven out of Bactria by the Yuezhi tribes. It is thought that his dynasty continued to rule in  Kabul  and  Alexandria of the Caucasus  until 70 BCE when  King Hermaeus  was defeated by the Yuezhi.   One of Demetrius' successors,  Menander I , brought the Indo-Greek Kingdom to its height between 165-130 BC, expanding the kingdom in India to even larger proportions than Demetrius. After Menander's death, the Indo-Greeks steadily declined and the last Indo-Greek king was defeated in ca. 10 AD.

Driven from the Tarim Basin by the Xiongnu in the early 100s BC, the Yuezhi pushed a  Scythian  tribe called the  Indo-Scythians  or Sakas, south into the Greco-Bactrian lands. In 140 BC they defeated the last Greco-Bactrian King, Heliocles I. Soon afterwards, the Indo-Scythians captured Arachosia from the Indo-Greeks (Arachosia was then renamed  Sistan ). Unable to invade India from the north, the Indo-Scythians took a more southerly route, through  Gedrosia  to Sindh, then moving north along the Indus river.   The Indo-Scythians were defeated by the  Parthian Empire  and driven from Sistan into India by 20 AD, where they founded the  Western Satraps  Kingdom that survived until about 405 AD. In the meantime, Parthia's hold on the region was tenuous, and soon broke away to become the short-lived Kingdom of the  Indo-Parthians .     In Bactria, the  Yuezhi  were united in the mid 1st century CE to become the  Kushan Empire .     [ edit ]   Northern region   Northern parts of Greco-Bactria were conquered by the  Tocharian  or  Yuezhi  tribes in the 140s BC, while the  Indo-Scythians  or  Sakas  conquered Arachosia (which became known as Sakastan and later  Sistan . The Indo-Scythians fled to India after they were defeated by the  Parthians  and  Indo-Parthians  in the early 1st century AD.   Invasions by the  Kushans ,  Sassanid  Persians,  Hephthalites  or  White Huns , and  Gktrks  followed in succeeding centuries.     [ edit ]   Kushans  and  Buddhism   During the  Kushan  rule, Afghanistan became the center of  Buddhist  culture and learning.          The Kushan empire reached its zenith in the reign of Kanishk the Great (AD78-144) who was responsible for the preservation development and propagation of the Buddhist religion and arts in the far east .

Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)       By 642  CE , Arabs had conquered  Persia  and invaded Afghanistan from the west, introducing Islam. Afghanistan at the time had local rulers called the  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Shahi , which were under the influence of the empire of  Tang China , which had extended its influence all the way to  Kabul . The Khorasani Persian-Arabs controlled the western and northern areas until they were conquered by the  Ghaznavid Empire  in 998.   The Arab forces did not conquer all of Afghanistan. The southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan remained independent, first as part of the  Kushano-Hephthalite  Kingdoms (from 565 to 870 AD), then as part of the Hindu  Shahi  Kingdom of  Gandhara , which lasted until it was conquered by the Muslim  Ghaznavid Empire  in 1021 AD.   Mahmud of Ghazni  (998-1030) consolidated the conquests of his predecessors and turned Ghazna ( Ghazni ) into a great cultural center as well as a base for frequent forays into India. The Ghaznavid dynasty was defeated in 1148 by the  Ghurids  ( Ghor ), but Ghaznavid Khans continued to live in Ghazni as the ' Nasher ' until the early 20th century, but they did not regain their once vast power until about 500 years later when the  Ghilzai   Pashtuns 's defeated the  Safavid  Persians in Kandahar. Various princes and  Seljuk  rulers attempted to rule parts of the country until the  Shah   Muhammad II  of the  Khwarezmid Empire  conquered all of Persia in 1205. By 1219, the empire had fallen to the  Mongols .

The country became a part of  Mongol Empire . Ghazni was main base for the Mongol campaigns of India.  Neguderis  settled there under the rule of  Chagatai Khans  while most of Afghanistan was a part of  Ilkhanate . De-facto of  Chagatai Khanate   Tamerlane , incorporated what is today Afghanistan into his own vast Asian empire.  Babur , a descendant of Timur and the founder of  Moghul Empire  at the beginning of the 16th century, made Kabul the capital.

(November 2007)       Afghanistan was divided from the 16th to the early 18th centuries. In the North were the  Uzbeks , the west was under  Safavid  Persia's rule and the east was ruled by the  Mughals  and local  Pashtun  rule. In 1706, the Afghans (Pashstuns), led by  Mirwais Khan Hotak  decided to rise against the Persian Safavids. The Persians were expelled. In 1721  Mir Mahmud Hotaki , son of Mirwais led the Afghans in invading Persia. The Persians were defeated in  the Battle of Gulnabad . The Afghans captured  Isfahan  ( Iran ) in 1722. Mir Mahmud became the Persian Shah. He began a reign of terror against his Persian subjects and was eventually murdered by his own troops. They selected  Ashraf Khan  as the new Afghan leader. He was able to secure peace with the  Ottomans  in 1727. However, in the next year,  Nadir Shah  of Persia launched a national revolt against the Afghan occupiers. He defeated the Afghans in the 1729 Battle of Damghan. Ashraf was killed the next year trying to flee back to Afghanistan. In 1739, Nadir Shah conquered Kandahar, and occupied Ghazni, Kabul and Lahore. After his death in 1747, the  Durrani  Pashtuns became the principal Afghan rulers.  [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Hotaki dynasty (1709-1736)       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty                 The excessive length of this article or section may adversely affect readability.   Please  discuss  this issue on the talk page, split the content into subarticles, and keep this page in a  summary style .       A picture of life in the old city of  Kandahar  under  Timurids ,  Safavids  and the Moghuls has begun to emerge since the British Institute began its excavations in 1974. Bronze ewers, imported glazed ceramics and ornate glass from Persia and imported porcelains from China speak of widespread trade. Locally made glazed wares in the Persian style speak of a cultural orientation toward the west.   On the whole, the indigenous  Pashtun  tribes living in the Kandahar area were more attached to the Persians and, indeed, on those occasions when the Moghuls received the city by means other than conquest, it was disaffected Persian governors who instigated the transfer, not the tribes. The tribes were not above pitting foreigner against foreigner in order to further their attempts to better one another. However, siding sometimes with the Persians, sometimes with the Moghuls, but never with each other, they perpetuated tribal disunity and prolonged foreign domination.   The principal contenders in these tribal disputes came from the two most important Pashtun groups in the Kandahar area, the  Ghilzai  and the  Abdali  (later  Durrani ), between whom there was long-standing enmity. As a matter of fact, because of these quarrels, many of the turbulent Abdali had been forcibly transferred to  Herat  by the irritated Persians by the end of the 16th century. This left the Ghilzai paramount in Kandahar, but the dispute more hotly contested, the hatred more deeply entrenched, and revenge more fervently sought.   The Persians were adept at manipulating such machinations and their rule at Kandahar was tolerant until the court at Isfahan began to sink in decadence. Mirroring this, the Persian governors of Kandahar became more and more rapacious and, in response, the tribes became more and more restless. Mounting tribal disturbances finally caught the concern of the court and they sent  Gurgin Khan , a Georgian known for his uncompromising severity toward revolt, to Kandahar in 1704. Kandahar's mayor at this time was  Mirwais Khan Hotak , the astute and influential leader of the Ghilzai.   Gurgin, advocate of law by force, burnt, plundered, murdered and imprisoned, but the tribes would not be subdued; revolts were crushed only to break out anew and Mirwais, credited with master-minding the rebellions, was sent to  Isfahan  tagged as a highly dangerous prisoner. Imagine Gurgin's surprise and dismay when Mirwais returned to Kandahar shortly thereafter clothed in lustrous robes of honor, symbols of respect and trust. The Shah of Persia thus declared the influence of Mirwais, not Gurgin, at the Persian court. Mirwais had extricated himself from a very nasty situation but, more importantly, he had observed the depths of decay at Isfahan, much as  Babur  had observed it at Herat, and correctly determined that the Safavid Empire was on the brink of collapse.   Mirwais formulated plans for disposing of the hated Gurgin; only the difficult task of waiting for the right moment remained.   The moment came in April, 1709. Because details of the assassination are varied, this discussion recounts the version popular among Kandarians today who say that Mirwais invited Gurgin to a picnic at his country estate at Kohkran on the outskirts of Kandahar city. Here the guests were fed all manner of rich dishes and plied with strong wines until ""everyone was plunged in debauch."" This was the moment. Mirwais struck, killing Gurgin, and his followers killed the Georgian's escort. The rebels then marched to take possession of the citadel.   Isfahan was astounded and sent emissaries to complain. The emissaries were imprisoned. Isfahan sent armies to take the city. The armies were defeated. The Persian court then sat in stunned idleness while Mirwais extended his authority throughout the Kandahar region.   If they were to remain free, the tribes must be united and to this formidable task the venerable statesman devoted the rest of his life. But not many years were left for Mirwais. He died in 1715. An imposing blue domed mausoleum at Kohkaran Bagh, next to the orchard where Gurgin was assassinated, is a fitting monument to Afghanistan's first great nationalist.   The qualities which enabled Mirwais to lead the tribes toward a meaningful unity were not, unfortunately, inherited by his ambitious 18 year old son, Mahmood, whose visions only encompassed conquest and power. Killing his uncle, elected successor to Mirwais, Mahmood gathered his followers and marched across Persia and seized the Safavid throne (1722). Mahmood met an early death in 1725 and was succeeded by his cousin, Ashraf, who ruled until 1730 when a new soldier-of-fortune, the Turkman Nadir Quli Beg, ended Ghilzai rule. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Durrani Empire (1747-1818)       Main article:  Durrani Empire       Ahmed Shah Durrani , the founder of the  Durrani Empire  and the modern state of Afghanistan, established his rule in 1747 at  Kandahar . Ahmad Shah, a  Pashtun  from the  Abdali  clan, was elected King in a  loya jirga  after the assassination of Nadir Shah Afshari in the same year. Throughout his reign, Ahmad Shah consolidated chieftains, petty principalities, and fragmented provinces into one country. His rule extended from  Mashad  in the west to  Kashmir  and  Delhi  in the east, and from the Amu Darya (Oxus) River in the north to the Arabian Sea in the south. With the exception of a 9-month period in 1929, all of Afghanistan's rulers until the 1978 Marxist coup were from  Durrani 's Pashtun tribal confederation, and all were members of that tribe's  Mohammedzai  clan after 1818.

Collision between the expanding  British  and  Russian Empires  significantly influenced Afghanistan during the 19th century in what was termed "" The Great Game ."" British concern over Russian advances in  Central Asia  and growing influence in Persia culminated in two Anglo-Afghan wars and ""The Siege of Herat"" 1837-1838, in which Persians trying to retake Afghanistan and throw out the British and Russians sent armies into the country waging wars with the British mostly around and in the city of  Herat . The  first  (1839-1842) resulted in the destruction of a British army; it is remembered as an example of the ferocity of Afghan resistance to foreign rule. The  second Anglo-Afghan war  (1878-1880) was sparked by Amir  Shir Ali 's refusal to accept a British mission in Kabul. This conflict brought  Amir Abdur Rahman  to the Afghan throne. During his reign (1880-1901), the British and Russians officially established the boundaries of what would become modern Afghanistan. The British retained effective control over  Kabul 's foreign affairs.   Afghanistan remained neutral during  World War I , despite  German  encouragement of anti-British feelings and Afghan rebellion along the borders of  British India . The Afghan king's policy of neutrality was not universally popular within the country, however.   Habibullah , Abdur Rahman's son and successor, was assassinated in 1919, possibly by family members opposed to British influence. His third son,  Amanullah , regained control of Afghanistan's foreign policy after launching the  Third Anglo-Afghan war  with an attack on India in the same year. During the ensuing conflict, the war-weary British relinquished their control over Afghan foreign affairs by signing the  Treaty of Rawalpindi  in August 1919. In commemoration of this event, Afghans celebrate  August 19  as their  Independence Day .     [ edit ]   Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war (1919-1929)          By 1921,  banditry  was dramatically curtailed in Afghanistan by harsh punishment, such as being imprisoned in suspended cages and left to die.           Main article:  Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war       King  Amanullah  (1919-1929) moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of  Europe  and  Turkey  (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by  Atatrk ), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was  Mahmud Tarzi ,  Amanullah Khan 's Foreign Minister and father-in-law - and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a  Loya Jirga ), which made elementary education compulsory. [ 19 ]  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional  Muslim   veil  for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after  Kabul  fell to forces led by  Habibullah Kalakani .     [ edit ]   Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah (1929-1973)       Main article:  Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah       Prince  Mohammed Nadir Khan , a cousin of Amanullah's, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October of the same year, and with considerable Pashtun tribal support he was declared King Nadir Shah. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of  Amanullah Khan  in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a  Kabul  student.   Mohammad Zahir Shah , Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle  Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan , who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles,  Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan , became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by  Mohammed Daoud Khan , the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the  Soviet Union  and a more distant one towards  Pakistan . However, disputes with Pakistan led to an economic crisis and he was asked to resign in 1963. From 1963 until 1973, Zahir Shah took a more active role.   In 1964, King Zahir Shah promulgated a liberal constitution providing for a bicameral legislature to which the king appointed one-third of the deputies. The people elected another third, and the remainder were selected indirectly by provincial assemblies. Although Zahir's ""experiment in democracy"" produced few lasting reforms, it permitted the growth of unofficial extremist parties on both the left and the right. These included the communist  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), which had close ideological ties to the  Soviet Union . In 1967, the PDPA split into two major rival factions: the  Khalq  (Masses) faction headed by  Nur Muhammad Taraki  and  Hafizullah Amin  and supported by elements within the military, and the  Parcham  (Banner) faction led by  Babrak Karmal . The split reflected ethnic, class, and ideological divisions within Afghan society. However, most of the following presidents and heads of state were Ghilzai (Taraki, Amin, Najib, Mullah Omar), once again trying to wrest power from the Durrani.     [ edit ]   Daoud's Republic of Afghanistan (1973-1978)       Main article:  Daoud's Republic of Afghanistan       Amid charges of corruption and malfeasance against the royal family and poor economic conditions created by the severe 1971-72 drought, former Prime Minister  Mohammad Sardar Daoud Khan  seized power in a military coup on July 17, 1973 while Zahir Shah was receiving treatment for eye problems and therapy for lumbago in  Italy . [ 20 ]  Daoud abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution, and declared Afghanistan a republic with himself as its first President and Prime Minister. His attempts to carry out badly needed economic and social reforms met with little success, and the new constitution promulgated in February 1977 failed to quell chronic political instability.   As disillusionment set in, in 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or ""Kaibar""), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA's  Khalq  faction (more independent of Moscow than the  Parcham  faction) managed to remain at large and organized an uprising.     [ edit ]   Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978-1979)   On  27 April  1978 the PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' corresponds to parts of 'April' and May). On  1 May , Taraki became  President  ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Once in power, the PDPA implemented a liberal and socialist agenda. It moved to replace religious and traditional laws with secular and Marxist ones. Men were obliged to cut their beards, women couldn't wear a  burqa , and mosques were placed off limits. It carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide and banning  usury .   The government also made a number of decrees on  womens rights , banning forced marriages, giving state recognition of womens right to vote, and introducing women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous  New Kabul Times  editorial ( May 28 ,  1978 ) which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country .... Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention.   The PDPA invited the  Soviet Union  to assist in modernizing its economic infrastructure (predominantly its exploration and mining of rare minerals and natural gas). The  USSR  also sent contractors to build roads, hospitals and schools and to drill water wells; they also trained and equipped the Afghan army. Upon the PDPA's ascension to power, and the establishment of the DRA, the Soviet Union promised monetary aid amounting to at least $1.262 billion.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       The majority of people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' restrictions on women's rights and in daily life. Many groups - partly led by members of the traditional establishment who lost their privileges in the land reform - were formed in an attempt to reverse dependence on the Soviet Union, some resorting to violence and sabotage of the country's industry and infrastructure. The government responded with heavy-handed military reprisals and arrested, exiled and executed many  Mujahideen  ""holy Muslim warriors"". The Mujahideen belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter  and National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ) began to covertly fund and train anti-government  Mujahideen  forces through the Pakistani secret service known as  Inter Services Intelligence  (ISI), with the intention of provoking Soviet intervention, (according to Brzezinski).   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On  14 September , Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     [ edit ]   Soviet intervention (1979-1992)       Main articles:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  and  Soviet war in Afghanistan                 The  neutrality  of this section is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (December 2007)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In 1979, with the Afghan army unable to cope with the large number of violent incidents, the Soviet Union sent troops to crush the uprising, install a pro-Moscow government, and support the new government. On  December 25 ,  1979 , the Soviet army entered  Kabul . This was the starting point of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the  Soviet war in Afghanistan , which ended only in 1989 with a full withdrawal of Soviet troops under the  Geneva Accords  reached in 1988 between Afghanistan and Pakistan.   For over nine years, the Soviet Army conducted military operations against the Afghan mujahideen rebels. The  American   CIA ,  Pakistan , and  Saudi Arabia  assisted in the financing of the resistance because of their anti-communist stance.   Among the foreign participants in the war was  Osama bin Laden , whose  Maktab al-Khidamat  (MAK)  (Office of Order)  organization trained a small number of mujahideen and provided some arms and funds to fight the Soviets. Bin Laden played only a limited part in this conflict and, in 1988, he broke away from the MAK with some of its more militant members to form  Al-Qaida , in order to expand the anti-Soviet resistance effort into a worldwide Islamic fundamentalist movement.   The Soviet Union withdrew its troops in February 1989, but continued to aid the government, led by  Mohammed Najibullah . Massive amounts of aid from the CIA and Saudi Arabia to the mujahideen also continued.     [ edit ]   1990s       Main article:  History of Afghanistan since 1992       After the  collapse of the Soviet Union , the Najibullah government was overthrown on  April 18 ,  1992  when  Abdul Rashid Dostum  mutinied, and allied himself with  Ahmed Shah Massoud , to take control of  Kabul  and declare the Islamic State of Afghanistan. When the victorious mujahideen entered  Kabul  to assume control over the city and the central government, internecine fighting began between the various militias, which had coexisted only uneasily during the Soviet occupation. With the demise of their common enemy, the militias' ethnic, clan, religious, and personality differences surfaced, and civil war continued.   An interim  Islamic Jihad Council  was put in place, first led by  Sibghatullah Mojadeddi  for two months, then by  Burhanuddin Rabbani . Fighting among rival factions intensified. In reaction to the anarchy and  warlordism  prevalent in the country, and the lack of  Pashtun  representation in the Kabul government, the  Taliban , a movement of religious scholars and former mujahideen, emerged from the southern province of  Kandahar . These  Taliban  took control of approximately 95% of the country by the end of 2000, limiting the opposition mostly to a small corner in the northeast. The opposition formed the  Afghan Northern Alliance , which continued to receive  diplomatic recognition  in the  United Nations  as the government of  Afghanistan .     [ edit ]   2000s          President  George W. Bush  and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan appear together in 2006 at a joint news conference.       In response to the Taliban support of Al Qaida, the terrorist group that perpetrated the  September 11, 2001 attacks  and the Taliban's refusal to assist the U.S. in prosecuting Al Qaida, the  United States  and its coalition allies launched an  invasion of Afghanistan  to oust the Taliban government. Sponsored by the UN, Afghan factions met in  Bonn ,  Germany  and chose a 30 member interim authority led by  Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun from Kandahar. After governing for 6 months, former  King Zahir Shah  convened a  Loya Jirga , which elected Karzai as president and gave him authority to govern for two more years. Then, on October 9, 2004, Karzai was elected as president of Afghanistan in the country's first ever presidential election.

It was founded in 1709 by  Mirwais Khan Hotak , the chief of the  Ghilzai  Pashtuns [ 1 ]  of  Kandahar . Mirwais and his followers rose against the Persian Safavids, starting in the city of Kandahar in 1709. He began his rule by killing  George XI  ( Gurgn Khn ), the  Georgian  governor of Kandahar and the direct representative the Persian kings. Next, Mirwais ordered the deaths of the remaining Persian government officials in the region. The Ghilzai Afghans then defeated the Persian army that was dispatched from  Isfahan  (capital of the Safavid Empire).   Mirwais Khan Hotak died peacefully in 1715 from natural cause and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki , who later led his army to invade Persia. In 1722, Mir Mahmud sacked the city of Isfahan and declared himself  Shah of Persia  (meaning  King of Persia ). However, the great majority still rejected the Ghilzai regime as usurping. For the next 7 years the Hotaki became the de facto rulers of eastern Persia and the  Peshawar  Valley.   The Hotaki dynasty was a troubled and violent one as internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control. The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the Hotaki dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  In October 1729, they were defeated by  Nader Shah , head of the  Afsharids , in the  Battle of Damghan  and pushed back to what is now Afghanistan. Nadershah marched his army through Kandahar in 1738 and eliminated the Hotaki dynasty.

It has joined Prague's Old Town and Mala Strana (Lesser Quarter) since its completion in 1402. But Charles Bridge was not the first stone structure to span the river there; it replaced the Judith Bridge, which stood in roughly the same spot and was destroyed by floods in 1342.      The foundation stone was laid with the assistance of Charles IV himself at  5:31 am  on  July 9 1357  (apparently so these odd numbers would have a palindromic sequence of ascending and descending digits). The structure was originally known as Stone or Prague Bridge, and received its present appellation around 1870, a change instigated by the poet Karel Havlicek Borovsky. Charles Bridge is 9.4 to 9.5 metres wide; it has a span of 515 metres and is supported by 16 arches. It has served transport, trade and cultural functions, but was also the scene of jousting contests, the Hussite Wars and revolutionary battles. Executions even took place there. Today Charles Bridge and Prague Castle are the two most visited sites in Prague.

His wife had urged him to build the bridge and it was given her name, Judith. It was around 514 metres long, seven metres wide at its broadest and had 27 low arches. In 1253 administration of the bridge was taken over by the Knights of the Cross. Two thirds of the structure was destroyed by a flood in February 1342, necessitating the building of a replacement - Charles Bridge.               Charles Bridge : the Statue Gallery        There are 30, predominantly Baroque, statues and groups of statues on Charles Bridge. Most of them were created at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. Today the statues are gradually being replaced by copies for reasons of preservation.              Charles Bridge Museum          The Charles Bridge Museum was opened in June 2007. It is located at Krizovnicke namesti, at the foot of the bridge itself. The Knights of the Cross, who have a long history of association with Charles Bridge, provided a former monastery hospital as a venue for the museum. In conjunction with the 650th anniversary, it features a permanent exhibition which presents the historical and cultural context of the foundation, development and present of this unique structure.

The successful invasion, aided by King  Henry II of England , marked the beginning of eight centuries of English dominance in Ireland.       Territorial  changes   Ireland was a patch-work of rival kingdoms prior to the invasion, although gradually moving towards being a genuine proto-state under a high-king. After 1169 power was nominally centralized at  Dublin , but this would not be consolidated until the  16th century .

The  Norman invasion of Ireland  was a Norman military expedition to  Ireland  that took place on  1 May   1169  at the behest of  Dermot MacMurrough  ( Irish :  Diarmait Mac Murchada ), the King of  Leinster . It was partially consolidated by  Henry II  on  18 October   1171  and led to the eventual entry of the  Lordship of Ireland  into the  Angevin Empire . Immediate consequences were the end of the  Irish High Kingship .           Contents       1   Invasion of 1169   2   Arrival of Henry II in 1171   3   Subsequent assaults   4   List of Norman captains   5   Notes   6   See also               [ edit ]   Invasion of 1169   After losing the protection of  Tyrone  Chief,  Muirchertach MacLochlainn ,  High King of Ireland , who died in 1166, MacMorrough was forcibly exiled by a confederation of Irish forces under the new High King, Rory O'Connor.   MacMurrough fled first to  Bristol  and then to  Normandy . He sought and obtained permission from  Henry II of England  to use the latter's subjects to regain his kingdom. By 1167 MacMurrough had obtained the services of  Maurice Fitz Gerald  and later persuaded  Rhys ap Gruffydd  Prince of  Deheubarth  to release Fitz Gerald's half-brother  Robert Fitz-Stephen  from captivity to take part in the expedition. Most importantly he obtained the support of the  Earl of Pembroke   Richard de Clare , known as Strongbow.   The first Norman knight to land in Ireland was Richard fitz Godbert de Roche in 1167, but it was not until 1169 that the main body of Norman,  Welsh  and  Flemish  forces landed in  Wexford . Within a short time Leinster was regained,  Waterford  and  Dublin  were under Diarmait's control. Strongbow married Diarmait's daughter,  Aoife , and was named as heir to the Kingdom of Leinster. This latter development caused consternation to Henry II, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to visit Leinster to establish his authority.     [ edit ]   Arrival of Henry II in 1171   Pope  Adrian IV , the first English  pope , in one of his earliest acts, had already issued a  Papal Bull  in 1155, giving Henry authority to invade Ireland as a means of curbing ecclesiastical corruption and abuses. Little contemporary use, however, was made of the Bull  Laudabiliter  since its text enforced papal suzerainty not only over the island of Ireland but of all islands off of the European coast, including England, in virtue of the Constantinian donation. The relevant text reads:   ""There is indeed no doubt, as thy Highness doth also acknowledge, that Ireland and all other islands which Christ the Sun of Righteousness has illumined, and which have received the doctrines of the Christian faith, belong to the jurisdiction of St. Peter and of the holy Roman Church"".   References to  Laudabiliter  become more frequent in the later Tudor period when the researches of the  Renaissance humanist  scholars cast doubt on the historicity of the  Donation of Constantine .   Henry landed with a large fleet at  Waterford  in  1171 , becoming the first  King of England  to set foot on Irish soil. Both  Waterford  and  Dublin  were proclaimed Royal Cities. In November Henry accepted the submission of the Irish kings in Dublin. Adrian's successor,  Pope Alexander III  ratified the grant of Ireland to Henry in 1172, and it was approved by all the Irish bishops at the synod of  Cashel . Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son, John, with the title  Dominus Hiberniae  (""Lord of Ireland""). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as  king , the ""Kingdom of Ireland"" fell directly under the English Crown.   Henry was happily acknowledged by most of the Irish Kings, who saw in him a chance to curb the expansion of both Leinster and the  Hiberno-Normans . This led to the ratification of the  Treaty of Windsor  in 1175 between Henry and Ruaidhr. However, with both Diarmuid and Strongbow dead (in 1171 and 1176 respectively), Henry back in England and Ruaidhr unable to curb his nominal vassals, within two years it was not worth the vellum it was inscribed upon.  John de Courcy  invaded and gained much of east Ulster in  1177 , Raymond le Gros had already captured  Limerick  and much of north Munster, while the other Norman families such as Prendergast, fitz Stephen, fitz Gerald, fitz Henry and le Poer were actively carving out virtual kingdoms for themselves.     [ edit ]   Subsequent assaults   While the main Norman invasion concentrated on Leinster, with submissions made to Henry by the other provincial kings, the situation on the ground outside Leinster remained unchanged.

[ edit ]   List of Norman captains   William Camden  claims the following list of people present at the invasion.

A baron of  Hugh de Lacy , the MacCostellos (Mac Oisdealbhaigh) were one of the first  Norman  families in Connacht, settling in Mayo in what became the Barony of Costello, which originally included part of neighboring County Roscommon (their sixteenth-century seat was near Ballaghadereen, now in Roscommon). They were the first of the Norman invaders to adopt a Gaelic name, which marks their descent from Oisdealbh, son of the famous Gilbert de Nangle (Latin: de Angulo), who was one of the first  Cambro-Norman  invaders. His family, the de Angulos, obtained vast estates in Meath, where they were Barons of Navan. The family thence spread into Leinster and Connacht, where the leading family adopted the Gaelic patronymic Mac Oisdealbhaigh, as we have seen. Those in Leinster, and those in Connacht that did not adopt this form, became Nangles (de Nogla); while those in Cork became Nagles. The Waldrons (Mac Bhaildrin) are a branch of the MacCostellos in Mayo.

Prince of Brazil  ( Portuguese :  Prncipe do Brasil ) was a title used in the  Kingdom of Portugal , for the heir of the royal  House of Braganza .   The title was created by  King   John IV of Portugal  on  27 October   1645  in favor of his eldest son and heir  Infante Teodsio , soon after Portugal had got rid of its  Spanish  rulers. During the  1645  1822 , ""Prince of Brazil"" was always conferred on the  heir apparent  of the throne, who also received the title of  Duke of Braganza . Also, in 1750 when the hitherto  Prince of Brazil  ascended as Joseph I, he granted the title  Princess of Brazil  (but not the Dukedom of Braganza) to his eldest daughter, the future  Maria I of Portugal , as the king believed he would remain without sons (his wife and he produced no further issue after 1746). In 1760, when Maria married her uncle,  Infante Pedro , he also took the  style   Prince of Brazil  as her  consort , until she became  queen regnant  and he became known as King  Pedro III . The eldest son and heir of the  Prince of Brazil  was styled  Prince of Beira  and Duke of Barcelos.   When  Brazil  was elevated to the  status  of a  kingdom  within the  Portuguese empire , the title was changed to  Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves . When Brazil proclaimed its independence in  1822 , the title was reused by the Imperial House of Brazil as a  dynastic  style for all of  Emperor Pedro I 's children.   Brazil's independence prompted Portugal to change the heir apparent's title once again, this time to  Prince Royal of Portugal .

After the Mongols sacked his capital of  Vladimir , Yuri fled across the  Volga  northward, to  Yaroslavl , where he hastily mustered an army. He and his brothers then turned back toward Vladimir in hopes of relieving the city before the Mongols took it, but they were too late. Yuri sent out a force of 3,000 men under Dorozh to scout out where the Mongols were; whereupon Dorozh returned saying that Yuri and his force was already surrounded. As he tried to muster his forces, he was attacked by the Mongol force under  Burundai  and fled but was overtaken on the Sit River and died there along with his nephew, Prince Vsevolod of Yaroslavl. [ 1 ]  The battle marked the end of unified resistance to the Mongols and inaugurated two centuries of the Mongol domination of Rus.
