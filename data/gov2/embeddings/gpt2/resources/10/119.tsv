We hope that partnerships will blossom, the overall cost of data development will drop (due to economies ofscale and by avoiding duplication where possible), and data that has been developed can be found more quickly.                                   Title     Location     Scale     Contact     Originator     Begin     End     Distribution                                          Napa County Orthophotography, 2002           Napa County          1""=200' and 1""=400'          Patrick Kowta          Napa County, Napa County Flood Control District & US Army COE          2002-01-01          2002-12-31          No Restrictions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Back to Top of                Page               © 2000 State of California.

Starting July 1, 2001 some of California's physical and          cultural geospatial information, formerly distributed by the Teale Data          Center, is being distributed to the public by the California Mapping Coordinating          Committee through servers at the California Environmental Resources Evaluation          System (CERES) in the Resources Agency and National Aeronautics and Space          Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center.              Note: CMCC will be working to update and improve some          of the spatial data in the library and provide access or links to more          up-to-date data served by others over the next several years as need and          funding permit.  Caution should be exercised when using some of the layers          of data as they are somewhat outdated; particularly those datasets that          change rapidly (i.e., schools, health facilities, etc.).  We strongly          recommend that users refer to the metadata or information about GIS datasets          for appropriate uses of the data, source information, scale information,          and general quality.         CMCC would like to acknowledge the support of the Executive          Sponsors in the Resources Agency, Department of Information Technology,          California Environmental Protection Agency, Governor's Office of Planning          and Research, and Health and Human Services Agency.

A key element of the CGC is the formation and participation of local collaboratives (e.g., Regional GIS Councils) composed of representatives of county, city and tribal governments, resource conservation and other special districts, private and public utilities, local colleges and universities and private sector organizations the local government agencies deem appropriate.  Input from local government and those private sector entities that provide support services is seen as essential to council success.
