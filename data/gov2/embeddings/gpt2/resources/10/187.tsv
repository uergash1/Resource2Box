Why Wetlands in the        Desert?         Early in 1990, the Arizona Department of Environmental        Quality (ADEQ) released the proposed Navigable Water Quality Standards        that significantly increased the water quality standards for discharges        into Arizona waterways. To meet these increasingly stringent standards, it        was estimated that it would cost $635 million to upgrade the        91 st  Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), which discharges        into the Salt River. Furthermore, this upgrade would not provide any        additional treatment capacity to the 153 million gallons per day (mgd)        output to the plant. This forced City officials to seek alternative        treatment processes to clean the valley's wastewater. One of the        first options the City considered was based on a 1992 unpublished        reconnaissance report from the  U.S.        Army Corps of Engineers  proposing using constructed wetlands to        alleviate some water related problems in central Maricopa County. The        report compared several alternatives and recommended a wetland project at        the convergence of the Salt, Gila, and Aqua Fria Rivers. The wetlands were        to provide water treatment for the 91 st  Avenue WWTP, create        wildlife habitat, and provide for flood protection for downstream        residents. Based upon the concept originated by the Corps, the        Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the City of Phoenix initiated the         Phoenix Water Reclamation and Reuse Study, Tres Rios Demonstration        Wetlands, Conceptual Design  report (1993). The report was written in        cooperation with the  Arizona        Game and Fish Department  (AGFD),  Arizona        Department of Environmental Quality  (ADEQ), Maricopa County Department        of Parks and Recreation, Maricopa County Flood Control District, and the        United States  Environmental        Protection Agency  (USEPA). The report focused on planning, design,        cost estimates, and environmental and regulatory processes needed to fully        research a wetland project.  By 1994, the City of        Phoenix had decided that it would cooperate with the BOR in constructing a        wetland project at the convergence of the Salt, Gila, and Aqua Fria        Rivers. The project was called, Tres Rios, which is Spanish for ""Three        Rivers."" The  primary objectives  of this project were to (1) test        the capability of constructed wetlands to treat effluent to meet the        expected future National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)        requirements, (2) to develop appropriate design criteria for a future        full-scale 800-acre wetland project in the Tres Rios area, which would        treat the entire 150 mgd of effluent discharged by the plant, and (3)        assess the net environmental benefit it would have on the three river        area.  Secondary objectives  included the (1) enhancement of        wildlife, and (2) to serve as an education and passive recreation resource        for the community. The source water for Tres Rios is treated        wastewater from the 91st Avenue WWTP which is located in southwest Phoenix        on the northern bank of the Salt River. The treatment plant is operated by        the City of Phoenix on behalf of the Multi-City Sub-Regional Operating        Group (SROG), a consortium of cities including  Glendale ,         Mesa ,          Phoenix ,  Scottsdale ,        and  Tempe .        The plant discharges approximately 150 mgd (168,000 acre-feet per year)        with up to 105,000 acre-feet pipelined (under contract) to the Palo Verde        Nuclear Power Plant. Effluent not sent to Palo Verde is discharged        directly into the Salt River. The Buckeye Irrigation District further        diverts 30,000 acre-feet from the Salt River 7 miles downstream and uses        it for agriculture. In the spring of 1995, construction began on        the wetland systems. The wetlands consisted of three discrete wetland        sites that had a total area encompassing 12 acres of free-water surface        treatment wetlands. They were called the Cobble site, the Hayfield site,        and the Research Cell site. Additionally, the continuous outflow of water        from the Hayfield site has helped to sustain approximately 1 mile of        riparian habitat along the Salt River. This area contains large cottonwood        (Populus Fremontii) and willows (Salix Goodings) as well as nonnative        species such as Salt Cedar (Tamarisk).

The program is overseen and funded by a grant from the                  U.S. State Department to encourage citizen participation in local                  government, signaling a positive shift in the United States' relationship                  with China.                In April 2001, nine students and two teachers from Chengdu's                  Shude High School arrived in Phoenix.  During their three-week                  visit they studied various aspects of Phoenix city government, observing                  meetings on topics such as youth programs, volunteerism, citizen                  involvement and budgeting.  Afterwards, 9 students from Central                  High School in Phoenix traveled to Chengdu to study Chinese city                  government for three weeks.                 Phoenix was the only U.S. city to participate this year.                   Thanks to the success of this year's pilot program, the city                  of Phoenix has received a second year of funding for another exchange                  to take place during summer 2002.                    In addition to participating in this exchange with Chengdu,                  Central High School is a magnet school focusing on international                  programs.  The school also promotes interest in Chinese culture                  with newly created Mandarin language classes.                Students continue to communicate with each other through                  message boards and chat rooms.  Shude High School students                  and teachers created a website at  http://exchangecpu.yeah.net                   where they share information on their exchange experiences and will                  post details on their community service activities.  Central                  High School students also have a website at  http://www.globalc.org/puhsd/central/                   with detail on their experiences with the project.                 On November 14, students in both Phoenix and Chengdu                  participated in an environmental restoration project. Students in                  China lobbied their government to clean up the polluted Fu Nan River.                   When the government finally agreed, it asked for the students'                  help — and students from Shude High School in Chengdu will                  plant trees on the banks of the Fu Nan river.  In Phoenix,                  on the same day, Central high School students worked on their own                  tree planting project at Tres Rios.
