One is by the front entrance and the other is in the entryway to the lower level of the building, where it can be seen by the students on their way to lunch or the gymnasium as well as by the general public using the community room. Embedded in the cement are individual clay pieces and found objects such as mosaics, stones, shells, leafs, keys, and other fascinating, simple and ordinary objects from all over the world. As many of the students as possible were engaged in the creation of the art. At a workshop the students drew on and cut rolled-out clay to make silhouettes of themselves and other images for the murals. After the workshop, the artist took the clay back to her studio and applied to it clear glaze and fired it to protect it for posterity.   Rosenberg has created numerous other Boston-area works, including a large mosaic in the MBTA Park Street subway station and another mural for the lobby of the Children's Hospital. Two of her murals can be found at the Central Square Library in Cambridge and the Miller's River Apartments in East Cambridge. Trained in architecture, sculpture, and ceramics, she studied at the Cooper Union and Art Students League (both in New York City), as well as at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She has lived in New England for most of her working life.   Commissioned through the Cambridge Arts Council's Public Art Program"

The theme selected is entirely up to the group of children who wish to       participate in the project. These murals will be linked together by       seams and grommets to create an amazing odyssey of color and       spontaneity.         Once completed, the murals will travel to major cities around the       world, as organized by the American and International Red Cross.         Please notify a  project       contact  as soon as possible       to register your mural effort. To qualify for the Art Mile       project,  murals must be completed and submitted by the date shown below for the theme       selected.

For information about the  project founders ,       see  biographies !                                                                             Project       History                                                                                     A Visual Journey         (Personal Thoughts from Joanne Tawfilis, updated June 5, 2001)         Somehow we (my husband Fouad and myself)       never dreamt the mural project would get so much attention. The reason for       creating it remains as it was meant to be: an activity that belongs to the       children of the world, one that we originated and now coordinate, and one       that surprises me for the magnitude of what is spreading and for the       symbol it now represents to children everywhere.         We can say that there is no feeling that       can compare to looking at each looming and beautiful individual mural.       Watching a twelve foot by five foot piece of blank piece canvas transform       into a masterpiece, is a delight that tingles my heartstrings and fills me       with indescribable joy. It is truly pleasurable to look at the children's       faces before they start painting, and when they stand back and look at the       final product.         With each brush stroke, the masterpiece       grows like a spring flower in an over night rainstorm. With each different       mural, and each we get to personally witness being created, we feel them       become a part of us. We are joyous that this positive energy and often       times the children's sad and lonely feelings transfers onto canvas and can       be absorbed in my soul. Sometimes I wish we could absorb the pain and hurt       as much as we do the happiness and enthusiasm. We feel helpless when we       see the portrayal of war and violence, but we know that putting it on       canvas will help them heal and eventually let go.         Fouad and I benefit the most. It's a life's       reward in a way, to be able to carry that energy, those feelings, and       those imaginations with me. We often have flashbacks of the look on the       children's faces and that's why we I talk about it a lot. Those beautiful       children's faces! And Fouad captures that through his eyes on film.         When we receive a mural by mail or       otherwise, it's also a real marvel. As we tear open a box or rip off a       plastic cover, it's like Christmas all over again. With each opening, we       feel the children's spirit jump off that canvas straight into my heart. We       can feel their laughter and teasing of one another, and feel the       reflective ness of those shy and quiet ones. We can see them too,       standing, practically leaning close to the canvas, putting themselves       hesitantly onto a corner or piece they claim as their own painting space.         And so, the Visual Journey continues, and       we feel the spontaneity and pure spirits of these young people.         We can smell the jacaranda trees and       imagine the giraffe loping through a Kenyan dusk on the Masai Mara, when       we look at the colors and figures the children and Tobias Mumbi created       for millions of children to eventually see. And we can hear the fun and       laughter of the youngsters from St. Mary's School in Nairobi as they stood       back admiring their beautiful work.         We can see Yusheng Zhao's longing for her       beloved China as she coaches the children with another wonderful Peruvian       Artist Coach, Carmen Rocios Pena de Klein, as the children paint the       lively and colorful fish-vivid and alive…like the dancing colors of Peru       and glistening fish of China.         We feel Goran's despair and the children of       Kosovo and Bosnia's pain and nightmares when we see the paintings of tanks       and grenades, of empty lands, destroyed buildings, and kerchiefed women       and children fleeing along country roads.         And from the Millennium International       Children's Conference on the environment, both Fouad and I feel the       connections to the children who care, the hundreds that came to paint       topics like ""Living in Cities, Water is Life, and Sharing the       Planet"". Oh, the connections to the Malaysians, the Palestinians, the       Israelis, the children from Ghana and Azerbaijan! We can see the       fifty-eight Korean children amassed on the floor designing together a       national mural-a magnificent mural completed in just 3 hours!         When we look at these murals, each of them,       we see something new each time, and savor the joy of children being       together unaffected by the barriers the world so readily constructs around       them. These are the moments that we seize, Fouad and me. There is no       photo, no exhibition, and no notoriety than can take those moments from       us-selfish, as it seems.         By growing up in a world of bigotry and       racism, sexism, and all the other ""isms"" that exist, this mural       project works like an electric eraser. They wash away the years of tears,       the injured heart, the clipped wings, the prisons and ropes that always       get in the way of letting us care, really care, about each other.         Working on the canvas allows each child a       little bit of time to throw away or forget the nuances that parents and       adults engrain in their children, for it is they who tend to teach them       how to draw lines in the sand, color in the lines, and separate themselves       by color. And each child affected by war and severe spiritual loss, or       those of different colors, or religion, or physical and mental ailments       get to give of each other and reach out to document what they really think       and feel inside. It is their view of the world, their flicker of       brightness that reflects in their eyes when they explore and communicate       among themselves. It is they, these children who see how different they       are, yet how much alike they be. When those differences unite them, it is       the time and place on the canvas that these children, even for a short       duration are the real peacemakers of today and our hope for tomorrow.         We are blessed to be able to coordinate a       project that was and remains a joint effort between my husband and me. It       is our love; our devotion and our common grounding that makes us believe       so much in the children of this earth. Infinity becomes understandable       when we work with these children. And through his eyes, he captures their       souls on film, making my memories more intense and lasting.         For us, the joys continue and with a       growing sense of emotional wealth, I look forward to the next twelve or       twenty four foot stretch of canvas and the brushes, the paint, the tarps,       the children. Yes, the children!                                                                                     Why                        Participate                                                                                     Children, parents and sponsors should       understand the importance of the Art Mile project and what their       contribution and participation will mean.  Their work will represent       themselves, their community, their school, organization,       town, state, AND country.  These murals will be seen world       wide and historically significant.   You and your children can make history  as       of the Mile Art project.

It dates from the Later Liang dynasty, just after the fall of the Tang. Wang was a high official who died in A.D. 923, having served both Tang and Liang Dynasty rulers. The design of Wang's tomb, though essentially in Tang style, anticipated future artistic developments.   This is one of two reliefs that framed the coffin chamber, part of a complex of rooms arranged on a north-south axis and accessed via a ramp at the south. The decoration in Wang's tomb followed the imperial Tang model, with lively painted wall murals lining passageways and tomb chambers. Tang painting was mostly figurative, and this emphasis is still evident in the marble panel. Several ink landscape paintings, which were also found in the tomb, however, were precursors of an entirely new genre.    Much of Wang's tomb art had been looted prior to excavation in 1995, but the two painted marble reliefs remained in excellent condition. The east wall relief shows a group of thirteen female attendants carrying luxury items to ensure the tomb owner's well-being. The relief on the west wall (shown here) is a lively depiction of a female orchestra, along with a conductor and two tiny dancers at the lower right. The combination of these and other paintings in the tomb indicate not only that Wang wished to surround himself with all the pleasures that he had enjoyed while living, but that he sincerely respected Tang art traditions.   The musicians have the ample proportions, full robes, and elaborate coiffures characteristic of the Tang conception of female beauty, which is said to have originated with the favorite courtesan of the emperor Xuanzong, Yang Guifei (see page 31).   The bodies of the musicians seem to sway with the tempo of the music. Easily identified are the pipe harmonica with a long mouthpiece (next to the conductor), a harp, a  zheng  (a plucked instrument), and a  pipa  (a Chinese lute). One musician also beats a large drum. The artists who sculpted these reliefs had a keen eye for accuracy.   Painted reliefs of this size and quality are rare from this period. Possibly artisans formerly employed in stone sculpture and relief carving at Buddhist sites, who had been displaced by the persecutions ending in A.D. 845, found new employment decorating tomb chambers such as Wang Chuzhi's.       previous    object 20 of 20       Table of Contents                                                   planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2004 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

This region was featured in honor       of Prime Minister Miki, who was born in Tokushima Prefecture, and is       considered the founder of Seattle’s Cherry Blossom Festival.          Performers and artists from this region were brought to the       festival to perform throughout the weekend along side Washington state       performers and visual artists.    “We       decided to invite the Awa Odori group, which originated in Tokushima       prefecture,” Yutaka Sasaki explained.          Prime Minister Miki really liked Awa Odori dance.          He thought it was one of the best dances in the nation and called       it Japan’s samba.    The first       Awa Odori dance troupe visited Seattle in 1982, and came again in 1989.          So, this year, our 20th anniversary, we invited the same dance       troupe.”         Shikoku Island is the smallest of       the four major islands in Japan.    The       name means “four countries,” and consists of four prefectures: Kagawa,       Tokushima, Ehime, and Kochi.    Shikoku       is sparsely populated with high mountains.          The Seto Ohashi Bridge, the world’s longest highway/railway       bridge built in 1988, connects the Shikoku Island to the mainland and is       helping to accelerate the island’s growth.         Artists from Tokushima and Kagawa       were featured guests of the festival.          In addition to the Awa Odori dancers and musicians, the festival       featured a Miki exhibit and Tokushima exhibit consisting of Awa puppet       heads and costumes, children’s art and Tarai Udon (noodle) making.          Tarai Udon, a part of Tokushima life, was prepared by master nookle       makers Akihiro Sakano and Katsuo Katayama.         Also featured at the festival was       Shizuo Okawahara, his son Makoto, and his group from Kagawa, who       demonstrated the art of making Tsutsugaki, hand-dyed banners.         The Miki Exhibit         The late Prime Minister Takeo Miki       of Japan is often seen as the real founder of the Seattle Cherry Blossom       & Japanese Cultural Festival.    Though       he and his family’s life was taken up with the responsibilities of       government, art was an enduring influence.          Madame Miki and the late Prime Minister are well respected artists       in their own right, as well as being well known benefactors to the arts in       general.         In addition to the Awa Odori dance       group, Madame Miki presented and exhibit of calligraphy representing three       generations of the Miki family, together with a photo display.          This exhibit served as a memorial to the man whose ambition was not       limited to leadership in government.          He has left an enduring stamp on the culture of Japan, and the       Festival here is part of his lasting legacy.         Madame Miki is also an acclaimed       potter who has taught at the University of Puget Sound.                         Awa Odori         When the Tokushima Castle was       completed about 1586, in the Tensho Era, Iyemasa, founder of the Hachisuka       Clan allowed the people to do anything they wanted in complete freedom for       a few days.    Released from the       strict social codes of that era, people in the castle town danced for joy.         This story is the most popular       explanation of the origin of the 400 year old Awa dance.          The local lord encouraged Awa dancing to stimulate the local       economy but from time to time he was forced to regulate the dance to keep       the people from getting carried away.          However, the energy of the people never weakened, and they have       continued this traditional dance.         In 1946 the Bon dance in Tokushima       was officially named “Awa Odori” by Koroh Hayashi (1877-1965),       Tokushima City’s first designated Human Cultural Treasure.          Bon is a Buddhist festival to honor the souls of ancestors.          Since 1966, the Awa dance has been held in August.         The Shamisen was originally the       main instrument to accompany Awa dancing but the instrument is difficult       to hear, so other instruments were added.          The present musical accompaniment includes shamisen, three types of       drums, gong and flute.         In Seattle, a new dance group was       formed in honor of the 20th annual Festival.          The Seattle Cherry Blossom Awa Dance Group is composed of local       people interested in learning Awa Odori and sharing it with others in the       community.    Tsutomu Kurokawa,       who first came to Seattle with the Awa Odori group in 1989, taught the       group.    “I would like to see       the Awa Odori group firmly established in this city,” Kurokawa said,       “so that it will continue after I have left.          Mrs. Miki is donating instruments to the Seattle group.          In Tokushima, everybody can dance.          They grow up watching others dance.”          Hanayagi Yosono (Mrs. Mitsuko Ito), Seattle dance teacher, danced       with the new group at the festival.    “This       was my first time to dance awa odori.          Awa odori is different,” she said.          “The timing’s different.    I       like it.”         (Awa puppet leader Minosuke Oe at       Cherry Blossom Festival – Photo by Dean Wong)         Mr. Minosuke Oe: Awa Joruri           Ningyo- Art of Awa Puppet                 Japanese puppetry is recorded as early as       the Heian Period.    It was introduced into Awaji, formerly one of the Tokushima       Prefecture islands, as well.    Hachisuka       Iyemasa, Awa leader during the 15th-16th century encouraged the art which       spread throughout Japan.    The       awa puppet first appeared in Osaka in 1684 and by the early Mejii period       there were as many as 74 puppet theaters documented.          After World War II, only doll makers survived.    Production diminished and only two professional groups have a       complete repertoire now.    Awa       puppet theatre in Osaka eventually evolved as Bunraku and flourished.         Awa and Bunraki puppet makers are       located in Tokushima.    The elder leader of the puppet makers and Tokushima’s       cultural treasure, Mr. Minosuke Oe, is continuing the tradition and was       instrumental in helping resurrect puppet making after the war.          His goal is to get the puppets on stage, not static like those       displayed in museums.    Mr.       Kenji Tada is one of the younger generation puppet makers who visited the       festival as an Awa dancer.         Minosuke Oe has been making       puppets for over thirty years.    “It takes about a month to month and a half to complete a       puppet,” he explained.    “It       takes more time to make a man than a woman – there are more mechanisms       for men.”    Oe is referring       to the various devises which allow the puppeteer to change the puppet’s       expressions.    “If I pull the       string, the eyes will close.    If       the character is angry or mad, you pull the strings for the eyebrows and       the mouth at the same time, and it will show he is angry.          The house maid can stick her tongue out when the master isn’t       looking and the wife character can have horns that come out.”         Shizuo Okawahara:Tsutsugaki       – large hand-dyed ba nners         A special treat at the festival       was the return of Shizuo Okawahara and his son Makoto, who are masters in       the art of “tsutsugaki” textile dyeing.          They are the 6th and 7th generations of a family that has operated       a dye business for nearly 300 years in the city of Takamatsu on the island       of Shikoku.    Shizuo learned       the trade from his father.    Today his son Makoto, a graduate of a prestigious art college       in Kyoto, contributes a modern sensibility to his family and this vital       tradition.           The Okawahara workshop is located       on a narrow and busy street in downtown Takamatsu.          They design and create bold and colorful banners for shops,       shrines, temples, fishing boats and festivals.          They also design and dye futon covers, happi coats and other items       ordered for special occasions.    They       employ a number of different dyeing techniques and are particularly famous       for their work using the method called “tsutsugaki.”          In this technique, a design is traced on the fabric with thin lines       of rice paste that are squeezed out of a cone shaped applicator.          The rice paste serves as a dye resist.          Dye is rubbed onto the fabric which is then immersed in the dye.          Numerous repititions of this process were used to create most of       the work on display at the festival.           The Okawaharas are particularly       famous for the colorful “shishi mai yutan” the large colorful cloth       that is used for the lion dance.    Since Shizuko Okawahara’s first visit in 1979 teaching       “tsutsugaki” at the University of Washington, he has spread knowledge       of his technique to Hawaii and has been on NHK public television.         Okawahara practices his       calligraphy daily by hanging paper in the hallway in his home and writing       each morning.    He finds that       it is difficult to do calligraphy unless he does it daily.          “Calligraphy has to come from your own heart,” he explains.          Okawahara practices in an unusual way.          As he writes, he sings shigin (right), a way of singing Chinese       poems read in Japanese.    He       sang and brushed on large paper the following Li Po poem at the Cherry       Blossom Festival in Seattle.

Index of American Design  1943.8.2654                From the Tour: Textiles from the Index of American Design   Object 11 of 17        Reflecting the English and European fashions during the eighteenth century, printed  cottons of all types were in great demand in America. Most printed textiles of the time  were imported from England, since laws prohibited the manufacture and printing of  fabrics in the colonies. By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the colonists  were defying the English bans, and cottons and linens were being printed openly by  shops in New England and in the mid-Atlantic colonies. Early printed textiles, like this  example, received their patterns through a technique of printing with wood blocks.  A design was cut in high relief on a block of wood. Colored dyes were applied to the  relief design, which was then stamped on the fabric, thus transferring the pattern.  Along with historical scenes based upon American figures and events, floral patterns  were popular. In this late eighteenth-century American printed cotton, the lavish pattern  of brightly colored flowers recalls the elaborate designs of Indian fabrics and of their  European counterparts.                 back to gallery     continue tour                                                           planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2003 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

His first artistic influences came from the canvases of his late great-grandfather, an artist from Spain. Valdez began drawing at age 3. As early as kindergarten, he realized his artistic abilities differed from others. While participating in a mural project at San Antonio’s Esperanza Peace and Justice Center at age 10, Valdez decided art would be his career.  He worked with his mentor, artist/muralist Alex Rubio, on murals around the Alamo City, eventually painting on his own.                       Upon graduating from Burbank High School, Valdez received a full scholarship to the International Fine Arts College in Miami, Fla. After one year, he accepted a full scholarship and transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, R.I., where he completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in illustration. Valdez exhibits and works on commissioned pieces and teaches art to middle school students in San Antonio.

For both murals, Galvez relied on the community for ideas, including images from local photographer Jeff Dunn. In  Crosswinds,  Galvez connects the different elements through clever composition. Poses and facial expressions guide the viewer's eye from one person to the next. For example, an elderly woman seems to smile at the young girl on her father's shoulder in the lower center of the mural. In Galvez's own words, ""I love Central Square. You hear different accents wherever you go, smell different spices in the ethnic restaurants. There's a wonderful multi-cultural spirit here, and I'm trying to capture that.""   Galvez, who makes his home in Oakland, California, studied painting at the California College of Arts and Crafts and San Francisco State University. His large-scale murals, inspired by traditional Mexican mural painting, grace exterior and interior spaces throughout the U.S. His best known works include the 63-foot  Homage to Malcolm X  (1997) in New York City and  Guardians of the Past, Stewards of the Future  (1999), a pair of murals for the U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C."
