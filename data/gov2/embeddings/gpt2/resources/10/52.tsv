DENR desires its employees to become active ambassadors to support the increase of different groups that will call this State their home, as well, as strengthen the cultures that exist within DENR currently. The hallmark of the plan is its focus on building relationships and inclusion. This is expressed in several emergent themes, each with its set of priorities and other action ideas. These were further distilled to the ""Top Four"" priorities that DENR will place emphasis on, while simultaneously pursuing other initiatives expressed in the plan as resources allow. For the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, diversity compels a total-quality, progressive workplace to reflect the changing demography of our society, at all levels of our organization. As a result, we gain unique opportunities to broaden our understanding and respect for others, providing each of us and all of us with potential for personal and professional growth, as well, as a sense of fulfillment as we work together to preserve and enhance North Carolina's environment and natural resources. Strategic Goals Fully integrate diversity into the ""way we do business"" Align diversity initiatives with specific needs and expectations, internally and externally Build a common understanding of diversity throughout DENR at every level of the organization Communicate and reward diversity initiatives that lead to success, by acknowledging the contributions of others Tie accountability for diversity success to job performance and career development   Who is responsible? Senior Management : Participate, encourage and work with all employees throughout the organization to prioritize their action plans and to monitor progress of assigned initiatives. Managers/Supervisors : Are accountable for establishing and sustaining a high-performing workforce that values differences and contributes to day-to-day operations of the department. Employee : Are responsible for working effectively internally and externally to maximize performance and to embrace the department's diversity openly. Human Resources Department : Will partner with managers/supervisors and employees to help create and sustain a high-performing and diverse organization. Also responsible for providing metrics to evaluate overall success. Diversity Council : Will provide overall strategic direction for department diversity initiative and monitor progress of the department's diversity initiatives. As a proactive step in embracing diversity, the Council will recommend action to the Secretary on diverse issues and act as a conduit of information on diversity to and from the division. Diversity Council's Committees : Will function as the operational arm of the Diversity Council soliciting, implementing and providing input and suggestions from the entire Council, Senior Management and others within the department.   Issues of Focus Change management attitudes and beliefs in order for all employees to be fully utilized Ensure employees feel valued at every level Ensure that employee understand diversity Diversity brings about a great amount of fear Opinions are not always valued in the department Make employees aware of the many different cultures working in the Department Consider Diversity when hiring or making promotion decisions                         Diversity Initiative Plan's Key Features DENR's Diversity Initiative Plan has several key features that distinguish it from others. It employs an approach or methodology that is different from the usual plan to address diversity in that its processes are: Relational versus linear ""Action at every level of the organization"" Integrative of current activities and new initiatives versus an all-new program template It focuses on several emergent themes that support the purpose of the plan and the mission of the department     Emergent Theme 1 : Build a Pool of Prospective Diverse Applicants ( Making DENR the employee of choice). Recruit and Retain a Critical Mass of Diverse Employees. Emergent Theme 2 : Foster Strong Relationships With and Among all employees throughout the department (Training/Education and Special Enhancements). Emergent Theme 3 : Enhance Idea Exchange, Engagement and Range of Learning Experiences Through Outreach Relationships, Internally and Externally (Website Development/Maintenance (Director's Message, DENR's Newsletter). Culture Statement The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)'s culture focuses on three critical statements: Led by People Driven by Performance to meet the strategic plan of the department Committed to Excellence, everyday and in everything that we do.    As PEOPLPE, states   ""People succeed because they...embrace Diversity.""   This, then, provides an important foundation for the Diversity initiative. It is, in fact, an integral part of the culture of this organization and is directly tied to the our success. Vision Statement DENR envisions an environment where all people are valued and respected. Our differences create a competitive advantage and a productive workplace for all. Mission Statement To enhance and foster a diverse organizational environment at all levels that embraces and promote inclusion and mutual respect. Value Statement We embrace the diversity of our workplace, marketplace, and communities. We believe no one is more important than another, each is important in a unique way, and we depend on each other to accomplish our mission. Diversity IS: A necessity for organizational success Enabling everyone to maximize his/her potential Creating an environment where co-workers respect each other Broadening the norms of acceptance; soliciting and listening to every employee's requests; opinion Helping individuals understand the needs of others Helping individuals communicate effectively with others Helping individuals recognize and capitalize on the value of a diverse workforce through implementing new ideas and perspectives Appreciating the importance of different views as part of our daily activities Embracing our diverse communities and endorsing minority supplier development through the Department of Administration, HUB Program Facilitating an understanding of and support for the variety of needs of our customers base   Diversity is NOT: Quotas Special treatment for selected individuals or groups A replacement or substitute for Affirmative Action Exclusionary of anyone or any group Special programs to make any group feel guilty A short-term strategy or option   Diversity is each of us and all of us!                               Visit the Employee Page       Sign in with your NCID and view upcoming Diversity events                               One North Carolina Naturally       North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources                     Disclaimer/Privacy  NCDENR, 1601 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-1601 919-733-4984   Fax  919-715-3060   Powered by IBEAM                     "

DEQ Budget Proposal: Restore Onsite Septic      System Program       Sewage from households and businesses is treated and      disposed of by connection to a sewer system or by installation      of an individual onsite (septic) system. More than a      million Oregonians rely on septic systems as a permanent      solution for treating and disposing of sewage and that number is      increasing. DEQ regulates the siting and inspections of      septic systems statewide.    The Onsite Program (septic system) last increased application fees  in 1998. Since that time, costs have increased approximately 3.4%/year. DEQ is requesting  approval to increase fee revenue by about $1 million/biennium  (or $500,000/year). The fee increases will be about 40-60% over current fees and take  into account rising program costs through the 2013-14 biennium. If approved, these fees would  become effective in early 2010. The fee increases will pay for existing technical staff  to process applications. With the exception of variance and product review applications  (which are statewide), the fees will only affect the public where DEQ administers the Onsite  Program (blue-color counties on this   Oregon County Map ).    If this package is not funded, 2.5 positions will be eliminated from the  program and the Baker City and the Warrenton offices will close.  In  addition, staff in the Grants Pass office will be reduced.

On this site you will find out about the work of the County Council Equality and Cohesion Unit to promote a fair society for everyone in Cumbria. Our vision for Equality is based upon the findings of The Equalities Review: Fairness and Freedom. This is a national inquiry into the big challenges that face the UK in building a fairer society for all. Most importantly the review proposed a definition of Equality that we as a County Council are working to:  An equal society protects and promotes equal, real freedom and opportunity to live in the ways people value and would choose, so that everyone can flourish. An equal society recognises people different needs, situations and goals and removes the barriers that limit what people can do and can be. Equalities Review - Fairness and Freedom (PDF 1.24mb) To achieve this vision in Cumbria we need to make sure that: Public services are reaching out to everyone.   Elected Members and community leaders have equality as a central part of their role.   We are addressing inequalities people face from early years and education through to accessing services as older people.   That equality is at the heart of how we manage our staff.   Meet the Equalities and Cohesion Unit          Equality & Diversity                 •   information@cumbriacc.gov.uk     •   Email this to a friend    •     Printable version              Reviewed 25/11/08       Equality | Accessibility | Website Statistics | Privacy | Disclaimer | Copyright |                      eVisit Tracking                 eVisit section Tracking                      Tell us what you think about our site...
