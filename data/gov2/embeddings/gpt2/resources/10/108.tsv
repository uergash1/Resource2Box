By Wayne Spivak, ADSO-CS 1SR  United States Coast Guard Auxiliary    Ahoy, Hunter! Do you a hunt waterfowl or hunt in and around lakes, streams, rivers, or ponds? Do you use a jon boat, rowboat, duck-boat or a blind near your favorite haunt? If you do, you should seriously think about getting more education -- specifically boating education!   Most of us think accidents never happen to us, but denial won't help if you or someone in your party is involved in an accident. In the year 2000, the Coast Guard reported that 23 vessels were involved in accidents while the occupants were hunting. Ten (10) fatalities resulted from those 23 accidents. That's about 1/10th of 1% of all fatalities reported that year -- not much of a risk. But it's 43% of all boating accidents related to hunting. Now that's a major risk!   1999 wasn't too much different, with 36 accidents and 13 fatalities. That's an improvement in your chances of living, with the fatality percentage decreasing to 36%. But if you're the unfortunate member of the 36%, it isn't much comfort.    Why the need for more boater education? It's based somewhat on the above statistics, but those statistics are the improved numbers. There has been a steady improvement (decline in accidents and deaths) in both boating and hunting since both mandatory and suggested education programs were instituted.    So, currently your chances of being in an accident or dying from that accident are, at least by the statistical pattern, low. But remember, these are still only the  reported  statistics! How many of us report little, embarrassing accidents, even if they caused not-so-little injuries?    If we as participants in the sport of boating and hunting slack off on the non-mandatory education efforts, these statistics will begin to rise. It has taken years of effort by the  interested parties (US Coast Guard Auxiliary as well as state agencies and other teaching entities) to improve these statistics. And, the collective ""we"" are still not happy!   New Dimensions    Boating while involved in hunting adds new dimensions and new dangers, to both boating and hunting. Not only do you need to observe the rules inherent in boating (both from a legal standpoint AND a boating technique stance), but you also have the added element of danger: your weapon. Boats, especially jon boats (or duck-boats) and rowboats are not known for their high degree of lateral stability.   It's extremely easy to swamp or broach these boats by shifting the weight distribution within the boat. Multiple hunters in a small boat just add to the danger. Fields of fire need to be mapped out and exactingly maintained. Movement within the boat -- from the act of swinging shotguns and rifles to the bird dogs jumping into the water -- need to be understood and factored into the mix.    Changes in the weather (leading to exposure to the harsher elements and their subsequent negative effects) are also part of the dangers both boaters and hunters endure. Hypothermia is the major threat to both groups of sportsman, especially during the hunting seasons in fall and winter.   Hunting and boating as well as every other outdoor sport are best enjoyed when you return back home safe and sound. Education is part of any sport, but activities that have more risk require more risk management. Look into a boating safety course in your neck of the woods if you haven't already done so.

They recently completed a project with an elementary school in Philadelphia to create a littering awareness poster. The original idea was to educate boaters about containing trash. Based on their research, however, they concluded that a large majority of the trash in our waterways comes from towns and cities. As such, the students created a poster that asks people to protect marine life, waterways, and drinking water supplies by keeping trash off of streets and highways. This project was funded by a grant from the BoatU.S. Foundation. To order a copy of the poster, contact the Wooden Boat Factory at 215-755-2400 or info@woodenboatfactory.org .

Five other facilities were lauded as Clean Marina Partners: Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, Green Ridge State Forest, Herrington Manor State Park, Queenstown Harbor Community Pier, and Rocky Gap State Park. Clean Marina Partners are not true marinas yet they minimize their own pollution and promote clean boating practices. Following the ceremony, Zahnisers General Manager Jim Sharkey led a tour highlighting some of the many pollution control measures he maintains. For example, there is a stormwater infiltration system along the bulkhead, a settling basin to collect residue from pressure washing , and an oyster nursery. ]  St. Michaels Marina is the 34th marina in Maryland to earn the Clean Marina Award. The harbor is what draws people to St. Michaels, said Steve Kilmon, marina manager. We are happy to do our part to protect the beauty of this area. The marina has about 50 slips and caters to transient boaters visiting the picturesque village of St. Bob Wilson, Mears Point Michaels. The daily influx of new customers Marina, with his Award presents a special challenge. Each new guest as reported in June. must be introduced to the marinas pollution prevention practices. To meet this need, Kilmon incorporated environmental rules into the slip agreement. For example, guests are asked to recycle cans and glass, refrain from discarding fish scraps into the harbor, and to clean up after their dogs. Also, he asks all fuel customers to use an oil absorbent pad or a nospill jug to capture any accidental spills before they hit the water. Sweden Point Marina in Smallwood State Park is the second  St. Michaels Marina, Sweden Point Marina, and Green Ridge State Forest are Certified  DNR-operated marina to earn the Clean Marina designation. Sweden Point offers slip rentals along the Potomac River in Charles County. There is no commercial boatyard but boaters can work on their vessels on land provided some basic rules are followed: the work must be done without creating any unsightly conditions or safety hazards. As part of their Clean Marina certification efforts, Park staff prepared an oil spill response plan and repaired a malfunctioning marine sewage pumpout station. The newest Clean Marina Partner is also a DNR facility. Bonds Landing Boat Ramp is located along the Potomac River, within the 43,000 acre Green Ridge State Forest (Allegany County). It is accessible only by dirt roads. Boaters that find their way to this remote put-in will find portable toilets and a sign urging environmental responsibility. Forest staff have taken measures to minimize pollution from other aspects of their operations as well. For example, all timber contracts stipulate that loggers must leave vegetated buffers around streams to protect water quality. ]  Operators of the 23 newest certified clean marinas and partners, along with dignitaries and Clean Marina program staff.

A more detailed template is available from the Clean Marina office: 410-260-8770. ]  Imagine boaters planning their cruises to stay at certified Clean Marinas throughout the mid-Atlantic region. Before long , boaters will have the opportunity to do just that. Virginia launched a Clean Marina program in January 2001 (visit www.deq.state.va.us/vacleanmarina for details). The District of Columbia and the National Park Service will be unveiling a Green Marina program this month. And the states of Delaware and New Jersey are committed to developing Clean Marina programs as well. Each of these efforts follows (or will follow) the structure of the Maryland Clean Marina Initiative. Representatives from the mid-Atlantic states have been meeting periodically t o establish consistency among the respective Clean Marina programs in everything from recommended pollution prevention measures to award criteria. By joining forces, we can ensure that boaters visiting a Clean Marina anywhere in the region will encounter the same high standards as have been adopted by Marylands certified Clean Marinas. Also, we can combine resources for things like advertising and, thereby, reach a greater number of boaters. Whether they are cruising the Chesapeake or Delaware Bays, the Coastal Bays, the Jersey Shore or any of the multitude of rivers that embrace the region, boaters can seek out Clean Marinas knowing that they are clean, safe,and environmentallyresponsible facilities. ]  ANCHOR BAY EAST MARINA, DUNDALK BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB, BALTIMORE BAY RIDGE CIVIC ASSN., ANNAPOLIS BERT JABINS YACHT YARD, ANNAPOLIS CHESAPEAKE HARBOUR MARINA, ANNAPOLIS COLTONS POINT MARINA, COLTONS PT.

GX267-56-7627353	"Overloading and too little freeboard is an invitation to capsizing and the most common cause of waterfowler drownings.  W boate  All of the accidents were a result of the boat capsizing or swamping due to overloading, sudden shifts in weight, or weather conditions. All but one happened under cold, stormy conditions in the latter half of the season. 60% were in canoes or boats 12' and under. Hypothermia (loss of body heat due to immersion in cold water) was a contributing cause of most of these deaths. More waterfowl hunter drownings occur on small sloughs than big lakes, possibly because big water hunters use larger, more stable boats, and are more likely to carry PFDs. PFDs: PREVENT FOOLISH DROWNINGS What can we do then, to avoid some of the hazards that befall too many hunters each year? The first and most important tip is to wear a U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device (PFD) while traveling to and from your blind. A PFD can make a difference between life or death for a hunter who falls into cold water. Camouflage models are available in both the Type III vest and full sleeve ""float coat"" varieties, and both should offer adequate flotation and considerable protection against hypothermia in case you make an ""unscheduled water landing.""  ate rfowlers seldom think of themselves as rs. A fter all, isn't a boat simply a means to cross the slough to the blind and set out decoys? Why bo ther with lifejacke ts and boat cushions that take up space that could be used for extra decoys, dogs, guns, and a million things that duck hunte rs d eem es sential? The reason is simple. Hunters drown ne edlessly eve ry year b e cau se t hey s p e n d m o re ti me g e t ting t h e pe rfect camouflage paint job on their boat, than mak ing ce r t a i n t hey h av e t h e n e c e s s a r y equipment and skills to su rvive in an emergency.  People on board boats used for duck hunting are legally required to wear, or have readily accessible, a Coast Guard approved wearable personal flotation device (PFD or life vest.) PFDs come in a variety of hunting styles including camouflage vests, coveralls, and the float coat shown.  EIGHT COMMON FACTORS In a review of ten separate accidents resulting in 14 waterfowl hunter deaths in Minnesota, eight factors common to hunting boat fatalities become apparent:  Waterfowlers are more likely to drown in a boating accident than be shot by a hunting companion. None of the victims were wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), and only one even had a flotation cushion in the boat. 2/3 were men between 18 and 23 years of age. Possibly because young men are more likely to take greater risks, and generally have less experience than older hunters.  By keeping knees bent in a seated position, enough air is trapped in shin of waders or hip boots to keep you afloat for hours, even if you forget to put on your PFD! In this position, boots will NOT turn a practiced individual upside down.  OVERLOADING: AN INVITATION TO TRAGEDY Boats used for hunting should be checked to see if they will float when filled with water. All modern outboard boats have a capacity plate that indicates the maximum outboard motor horsepower as well as the carrying capacity of the boat. This is a good way to determine whether or not your boat is large enough for the gear you wish to transport. Any attempt to overload will result in a dangerous loss of freeboard, and too little freeboard is an invitation to the first large wave to swamp your boat. Hunting boats are typically small craft (under 14'), and many have flat bottoms which are particularly unsuitable for rough water. Hunters should avoid crossing large open bodies of water and stay as close to shore as possible when traveling to and from hunting locations. Make sure you have enough fuel. Take into account that your motor will use more gasoline when hunting than on a summer fishing trip. Decoys, dogs, and shells weigh more than fishing rods and tackle boxes, and will demand more power (and gasoline) from your outboard.  THE GALES OF NOVEMBER Keep an eye on the weather. All but one of the waterfowling boat fatalities in a seven year period happened after October 21, and in windy or stormy weather. Four hunters were lost in one storm in 1984, and in the infamous Armistice Day Storm of 1940, hundreds of hunters were stranded and scores drowned when boats capsized or swamped in six foot waves whipped by 50 MPH winds. Don't let bluebird weather at the start of a hunting trip lull your judgment, and be sure to get an up-to-date weather forecast. With practice, you can float in hip boots or waders, even if you forget to put on your PFD! If you keep your legs bent in a seated position, enough air is trapped in the shin area of the boot to keep you afloat for hours. You can then propel yourself backwards to return to your boat. Waders do not turn the practiced wearer upside down, and even when filled with water, they will not pull you to the bottom and do offer protection from hypothermia. As mentioned before, hypothermia is a factor in most duck hunter fatalities. Since water conducts heat 25 times faster than air of the same temperature, it is important to keep as much of your body out of the water as possible. If you unexpectedly enter cold water (any water less then 70 is considered cold), immediately attempt to reenter the boat. This will minimize the effects of hypothermia, and greatly increase your chances for survival. Do not remove your clothing unless it's absolutely necessary, since even wet clothing holds body heat in like a diver's wet suit.  Buoyancy of duck decoys, combined with the flotation provided by air trapped in hip boots can save your life.   Duration of Immersion (hours)  water and slowly tread water or dog paddle. The operative word here is slowly. Excess movement such as swimming or thrashing about, accelerates heat loss and encourages hypothermia. Unconsciousness can occur in as little as 15 minutes in very cold water, and death follows unconsciousness. ALCOHOL: THE DEADLY COMPANION When hunting, alcoholic beverages should be avoided. Besides increasing the possibility of a firearms accident, even ""just a couple of swallows"" can seriously impair judgment, increase risk taking, and reduce visual awareness. Contrary to what many people believe, alcoholic beverages don't warm you up, but actually serve to speed up cooling and bring on hypothermia. TORSO REFLEX: YOUR LAST GASP If you know you are about to fall into cold water, cover your face with your hands and hold your breath. Anyone who has ever gotten into a cold shower, knows the effects of the ""Torso Reflex."" This is your automatic gasp for air in response to being hit in the chest area with cold water. If your mouth is under water when this gasp occurs, drowning is the most probable outcome.

VIDEOS The DNR has VHS videos available to Minnesota groups and organizations that are of special interest to waterfowlers. Judgement on the Water (#198), has an especially good sequence on duck hunting safety. Wader Safety (#194), explains how to handle emergencies while wearing hip boots and waders. It shows people jumping into the water wearing waders, and how to float and swim when wearing both types of boots. For information on borrowing these videos, call the DNR Video Loan Service at the phone numbers below.  H.E.L.P. YOURSELF If you fall in while wearing a PFD and decide not to swim for shore, and can't get back into your swamped boat, you can reduce the effects of hypothermia by assuming the heat escape lessening position (H.E.L.P.). Cross ankles, cross arms over chest, draw knees to chest, lean back and try to relax. This head out of the water, fetal position reduces body heat flow to the water by at least 50%. It should, however, be tried in a pool before depending on it. Note that the hands should be kept high on the shoulders or neck. If kept out of the water, the hands will stay warmer and more flexible -- an important factor in self rescue. If more than one person is in the water and wearing PFDs, the ""huddle"" is recommended. This is where small groups of two to four ""hug"" with chest closely touching chest. Your arms should be placed around the backs of the others and kept underwater, while smaller individuals or children can be placed in the middle of the ""sandwich."" The huddle helps to conserve body heat and it is also easier for rescuers to locate than one lone victim. The close proximity of victims can serve also as a significant morale booster. Studies have shown that 97% of all non-PFD wearing adult males can float motionlessly, hands stretched behind their heads, with faces out of the water for long periods. If large waves prevent floating on the back, a non-PFD wearing individual should keep his or her head out of the  Minnesota  DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES  Boat and Water Safety Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 500 Lafayette Road St. Paul, MN 55155 - 4046  For more information, call: (Metro Area) (651) 296-6157 (MN Toll Free) 1-888-646-6367 Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (Metro Area) (651) 296-5484 (MN Toll Free) 1-800-657-3929 www.dnr.state.mn.us/boating.html This information is available in an alternative format upon request.

GX265-58-13170227	4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, CO 80246-1530  Phone: 303-692-2160  Fax: 303-691-7704  Recreational Fatalities in Colorado, 1996-1998 July 2000 No. 35  Unintentional injuries constitute the fifth leading cause of death in Colorado, killing over 1,400 Coloradans each year between 1996 and 1998. The number of deaths from unintentional injuries increased from 1,161 in 1990 to 1,539 in 1998. Deaths due to injuries during recreational activities are of particular interest in Colorado. This Brief aims to describe recreational activities-related fatalities that occurred in Colorado from 1996 through 1998 using the same procedures as those in a previous report describing recreational fatalities from 1993 through 19951. Unlike fatalities from most other leading causes of death, identification of the circumstances of injury death is not always possible through use of underlying cause of death codes. Therefore, to identify recreation-related fatalities, injury descriptions provided on the death certificate of all deaths occurring in Colorado during 1996 through 1998 were examined. Recreation relatedness was determined by analysis of the complete death certificate for each suspected case. Motor vehicle fatalities (decedent was a driver, passenger, or pedestrian) were not included in this report. Although every effort was made to uncover all recreation-related deaths occurring in Colorado, this compilation may not be all inclusive. Due to the difficult nature of determining such fatalities, some recreational fatalities may have been missed. The recreational fatalities identified were grouped by categories that best described the deaths and allowed for meaningful analyses. Because no standard categories for recreational deaths exist, the categories in the previous Brief and this report were determined by the Health Statistics Section after analysis of various reports and consultation with individuals specializing in injury epidemiology. Information regarding certain recreational categories is contained in the text for each category. The data presented in this report are for those recreational fatalities that occurred during the calendar years 1996-1998 in the state of Colorado to both state residents and nonresidents. Because of the small sample size, the conclusions drawn in this report might differ from the conclusions made in the previous report, and the results should be interpreted with caution.  Overview For the three-year period of 1996-1998, 211 recreation-related deaths were identified. Among those deaths, 21 percent (44 deaths) occurred to non-Colorado residents. The annual average death ratio* was estimated as 1.8 deaths per 100,000 Colorado resident population, which is lower than the annual average ratio of 2.3 deaths per 100,000 Colorado resident population in the previous report. Among the nine recreational categories, the greatest number of fatalities was recorded in the category of climbing/hiking with 37 deaths. Snow skiing was the next most common category with 36 deaths, followed by bicycling with 30 (Figure 1). *  all occurrences divided by resident population  1 On the Web: http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/hs/  E-Mail: health.statistics@state.co.us   Overall, males accounted for 82 percent of all recreational deaths in Colorado in the three year period, and persons age 20-39 had the highest number of recreational deaths at 89 (Table 1). About  93 percent of all recreational deaths (196) occurred to white/nonHispanic people (data not shown). The leading types of recreational fatalities differed by age group (Tables 1 and 2).

Tied categories.  2   Swimming pool fatalities were the most common recreational fatalities for the age group 0-9 at 31 percent of deaths. Snow skiing fatalities were the leading type of death for those age 1019, while climbing/hiking fatalities were the leading type of death for the 20-39 age group, at 23 percent and 29 percent respectively. For the age group 60 and older, bicycling accounted for the greatest proportion of recreational deaths (25 percent). Climbing/Hiking Although the activities of climbing (i.e., technical rock climbing and/or mountaineering) and hiking can be very different, for the purposes of this study it was not possible to segregate the two types of recreational activity deaths. There were 37 climbing/ hiking deaths during 1996-1998 (Table 1). Of the 37 climbing/ hiking deaths, 32 (86 percent) were male and 26 (70 percent) were in the 20-39 age group (see Figure 2).  Snow Skiing This category includes both downhill/alpine and cross-country ski fatalities. There were 36 such deaths recorded in Colorado during the calendar years 1996-1998. Fatal ski injuries were most often caused by the skier hitting a tree or another object (61 percent), falling (14 percent), or being caught in an avalanche (11 percent) (See Figure 4). The majority (69 percent) of snow skiing fatalities were less than 40 years of age. Over 80 percent were male.  The months with the greatest number of climbing/hiking fatalities were July and October with six deaths each, and August with five deaths. All of the 37 climbers/hikers identified in the current analyses died from falling. Bicycling It was not possible to distinguish between pure recreation and transportation bicycling deaths; therefore, this category includes both types of bicycling injury fatalities. There were 30 bicycling fatalities over the three-year period (Table 1 and Figure 3). Over 83 percent (25 deaths) of the bicycling deaths were male. Bicycling was the leading type of recreational fatality for people age 60 or older.  Swimming--Nonpool Swimming deaths were segregated by pool and nonpool. No boatrelated deaths were categorized as swimming (pool or nonpool) deaths in this report. Nonpool fatalities include those in which the decedent was swimming or playing in a lake, reservoir, pond, river, stream, etc. In the three-year period, there were 18 nonpool swimming deaths, all of whom were male. Eight of these fatalities were in the 2039 age group. Fifteen of the 18 nonpool swimming deaths occurred during June, July, and August.  3   Swimming Pool This category includes all deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, including those that occurred at a place of residence. There were eight swimming pool fatalities during the three-year period. Four of the eight swimming pool deaths were to children 0-9 years of age; five were male. Six swimming pool fatalities occurred at a public place for recreation and sport and/or public building. Canoeing/Kayaking and Rafting For the purposes of this Brief, canoeing and kayaking deaths have been grouped together. There were seven canoeing/ kayaking-related deaths and 14 rafting deaths. Seventeen of those who died from canoeing/kayaking and/or rafting accidents were male. Eleven of the 21 fatalities (52 percent) were over 40 years of age. All 21 canoeing/kayaking and rafting fatalities were caused by accidental submersion and/or drowning.  Horseback Riding There were 13 horseback riding fatalities during 1996-1998, ten of which occurred in May through August. Boating/Water Skiing This category does not include those who were fishing from a boat. A separate category (presented below) includes all fishing-related deaths. There were 21 boating and/or water skiing deaths during 1996 through 1998. Of the boating/water skiing fatalities, 48 percent (10 deaths) were 20-39 years of age; 18 of the 21 deaths were male. Of the 21 deaths, 19 occurred in April through August. Only Jefferson County had more than two (four deaths) fatal boating/water skiing injury occurrences in 1996 through 1998. Fishing and Hunting Five fishing and five hunting deaths occurred over the threeyear period. Four of the hunting fatalities were 40-59 years of age and older; all of the fishing and hunting fatalities were male.  Table 3.

GX250-49-3090204	"""Good Mate"" Video for Boaters Available to Marinas! Promoting stewardship of America's waterways is the focus of this outstanding video, produced by The Ocean Conservancy. According to The Conservancy, there are more than 10,000 marinas in the United States serving more than 22 million pleasure and work boats. Small day-to-day changes in the ways boaters maintain and operate boats can make a big difference in protecting aquatic habitats. The video focuses on four sources of pollution associated with recreational boating , and teaches simple, inexpensive techniques that boaters can follow to prevent water pollution from fuel and oil, sewage, boat maintenance, and debris. Marina operators familiar with Annapolis will be treated to footage of some very familiar waters. A simple and easy way to reach customers is playing the video either in the ship's store or other common area during the spring commissioning season. This reinforces efforts to support clean marinas, and reminds boaters that everyone has a role in protecting the environment. The video sells for $9.95 plus shipping .

Continued on page 2  ""Good Mate"" Video Available  Page 4  1   Maryland's Two ""No Discharge Zones"" The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would like to remind boaters and marninas that Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays are no discharge zones (NDZs) for boat sewage. These two NDZ designations (the first in Maryland) went into effect in 2002 and remain in effect. It is illegal for a vessel to discharge raw sewage anywhere within three miles of the coast. An NDZ is an area of water where it is also illegal to discharge sewage treated by a certified Type I or Type II marine sanitation device (MSD). When operating in an NDZ, Type I and Type II MSDs cannot be used and must be secured. Acceptable methods to secure these systems include locking the door to the head or disabling the seacock. Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays were selected because there was very strong local support for the NDZ designations in both areas. Additionally, both areas have living resources that are sensitive to the discharge of boat waste, both have a high concentration of vessels, and both have sufficient pumpout facilities to accommodate resident and transient boats. Steuart Chaney, president of Herrington Harbour Marinas, is also a member of the Lower Western Shore Tributary Strategies Team which was instrumental in the implementation of the Herring Bay NDZ. "" The boaters and maritime community of Herring Bay are taking the lead in helping the environment by their support of the NDZ in Herring Bay,"" he said. "" We believe that this initiative will focus regulatory attention on the other, more significant sources of pollution. Ultimately, the NDZ will lead to a cleaner environment for all of Herring Bay."" Dave Blazer is the executive director of the Maryland Coastal Bays Program. Dave points out that an NDZ recommendation was included in the 1999 Comprehensive Management and Conservation Plan for the Maryland Coastal Bays. ""Clean water is the very lifeblood of both Ocean City and Worcester County,"" he said. ""The no discharge zone designation for the northern Coastal Bays fits perfectly into our plans to address all sources of pollution in this area."" For further information about the Herring Bay and northern Coastal Bays NDZs, visit www.dnr.state.md.us/ boating/pumpout/ndz.html or call DNR at (410) 260-8770. Additionally, the Natural Resources Police (NRP) Reserve Officers are once again offering Courtesy Vessel Examinations at marinas throughout Maryland. The Courtesy Vessel Examination program is a great way to provide boaters with safety and environmental information (including marine sanitation) in a very positive and non-threatening manner.

Anne Arundel County Waste Management estimates there are about 40 tons of shrink-wrap used in winter boat storage in the county. In Cecil county, dumpsters will be placed at Kingfisher Environmental Service Inc., McDaniel Yacht Basin, and Duffy Creek Marina. In Anne Arundel County, the public works department will place dumpsters at Clark's Landing Marina in Shady Side, Herrington Harbour North in Tracy 's Landing , Pasadena Boatel, Port Annapolis Marina, and Rhode River Marina in Edgewater.

Washburn's Boatyard (Solomons), Sunset Marina (Ocean City), and Anchorage Community Marina (Annapolis) have all recently been certified as clean facilities. To become a certified Clean Marina or Clean Marina Partner, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management. Chris Washburn, owner of Washburn's Boatyard, maintains a clean facility by conducting most work, such as engine repair, carpentry, and fiberglass, indoors. Yard manager Don Reimers says, ""Work outside is done using ground covers and/ or dustless sanders. Anybody who wants to work on their own boat also has to adhere to the same strict yard rules as our own staff. We work hard to educate all our customers about the importance of keeping trash and debris out of the water."" Washburn's is unique as it is the first boatyard to seek the award independently Don Reimers (left) and Chris Washburn happily accept their Clean Marina award. (Photos of from the marina in which it is located. Sunset Marina and Anchorage Cmmty. Marina Although Sunset Marina does not currently have a service department, boat staff were not available at press time.) owners may use independent contractors to work on their boats at the marina. Marina manager Brian Tinkler says, ""By having all slip holders and contractors work within a set of `environmental rules' we have a lot fewer problems. Providing recycling for oil and antifreeze also makes it easier for contractors to work within these rules."" Brian also says, ""Fuel docks are another big challenge. We have spill kits in each fueling area and written emergency response plans that all employees are trained on. I feel we are very well prepared if anything should happen."" At Anchorage Community Marina, all slip holders receive ""clean boating tip sheets"" on a variety of topics, in mailings throughout the year and clean boating tips are posted at the club house. And while they do not store any fuel on site, they have prepared written emergency response plans and contracted with an emergency spill response company, in the event of a fuel spill from a boat in or near their marina. Neighbors on either side of the small facility have a copy of the emergency response plan and all slip holders have the number of the spill response company. ""We are glad to do our part to support this program and to protect the waters surrounding our community,"" said dock chairman John Boaz. ""We felt this was a very worthy program and came together to participate and improve what we do here."" ]  workshops continued from page 1  5. Enjoy Your Rewards. Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps. Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in program displays at boat shows and in the newsletter. 6. Maintaining Clean Marina Status. Certified Clean Marinas must annually confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards. At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will set up a meeting to reaffirm Clean Marina status. In addition to reviewing the certification process and assistance available, a highlight of this year's workshops was a detailed review of the many regulations and permits that apply to marina and boatyard activities. On hand was Bob Daniel from the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) which is the agency that issues and enforces the permits and regulations in the state Mr. Daniel works in the Environmental Permits Service Center at MDE, a unit aimed specifically at helping business operators identify, apply for, and operate under necessary permits. The Environmental Permits Service Center can be reached by calling (410)537-3772 or 800-633-6101, extension 3772. In spite of the weather, which forced the change of the date of one workshop and the location of another, approximately 100 people attended the workshops, representing 65 marinas and boatyards. Three marina managers signed a Pledge directly following a workshop and many more received Guidebooks to learn more about the program. ]  56 C  ERTIFIED C LEAN  M  ARINAS  ,B  OATYARDS AND Y ACHT C LUBS SPRING COVE MARINA, SOLOMONS SPRING COVE MARINA, ROCK HALL ST.

Since the mandatory classes began, Michigan has seen a significant drop in hunting related injuries and deaths.    Hunter safety courses are geared to improve hunter ethics, teach safe, responsible hunting, promote landowner-hunter relationships, encourage knowledge of laws and regulations and learn more about wildlife and habitat resources.   Students should be 12 years of age and older. Younger kids are welcome as long as they are able to read, comprehend and participate in the skills course work.     The minimum 10-hour course includes lectures, demonstrations, videos and explores a wide range of hunting equipment (firearms, muzzleloaders, archery and cross bow) and their safe use. Each volunteer instructor sets the schedule of the course.  Students must participate in the entire course (minimum 10-hours) to earn their certificate.

Most states and provinces in North America require some type of Hunter Safety courses.    The Hunter Safety and Firearm Safety courses are NOT the equivalent of specific gun safety course  and do NOT meet the requirements for Concealed Weapons permits.

Enjoy! !  Annual Clean Marina Awards Ceremony Set for August 2003 Each summer the Clean Marina Initiative hosts an annual awards ceremony to recognize marinas certified in the preceding year. The ceremony is a time to spotlight the great pollution prevention practices under way throughout the industry and to thank these marina and boatyard operators for their efforts to protect Maryland's waterways. The day will consist of remarks from a DNR representative (Secretary C. Ronald Franks has been invited), a representative from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, and elected officials. The press is invited along with State representatives from each Clean Marina's district. Clean Marinas from the past year are presented citations, enjoy lunch, and round out the day with a tour of the host facility. This year, at least 15 facilities will be recognized at the event being planned for the first week in August. The timing was chosen to coincide with ""National Marina Day,"" which is an effort of the Marina Operators Association of America (MOAA) to celebrate the rich history of the marina industry as well as its bright future. National Marina Day focuses on the role of marinas as family-friendly gateways to boating and as stewards of the environment. To learn more about this event, slated nationally for August 9th, visit www.moaa.com. The goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify twenty five percent of Maryland's approximately 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004. While not an unrealistic goal, presently just 11% have been certified (58 Clean Marinas and 12 Clean Marina Partners). Marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs are strongly encouraged to participate in this voluntary program aimed at preventing future regulation of this industry. For more information on the steps to certification, to obtain a Clean Marina Guidebook and Award Checklist, or to schedule an informal walk through to assess a facility, call 410-260-8770.

I  NSIDE  T  HIS ISSUE  ... 2 2 3 1  Clean Marina Initiative Progress Report Marketing Tips for Marinas Two New Clean Marinas!   B  Clean Marina Program Progress Report  TWO NEW CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS Knapps Narrows Marina (Tilghman Island) and Oak Harbor Marina (Pasadena) both recently became certified Clean Marinas. To become a certified Clean Marina, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management. Best management practices for all these topics are offered in the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook. Mark Julyan, General Manager of Knapps Narrows Marina, maintains a clean marina by insisting on vacuum sanding in the yard and using ground tarps when heavy work is being conducted. Mark also enforces strict rules on the fuel dock and gives each customer a small oil-sorb cloth to capture any drips or spills. Additionally, he has strengthened his contracts with all slip holders, land storage customers, and subcontractors to include the statement that the marina follows Clean Marina practices and expects all customers to do the same. Knapps Narrows Marina also took advantage of Clean Marina grant funding in 2001 to purchase a wash water recycling system, vacuum sanders, a high-volume lowpressure spray gun, and to install a vegetated riparian buffer to filter stormwater. As reported in the last issue Ken and Barbara Broman, owners of Oak Harbor Marina, and their sons have made many of Under way, Sunset Marina (Ocean City) was certified this improvements to Oak Harbor Marina to earn their Award. They purchased the marina and boatyard spring. Doris Kirkner accepts approximately one year ago, after having worked there for many years. The facility had suffered from the Award. neglect and had collected many derelict boats, mysterious drums and lots of trash and debris. The Bromans cut up and removed many abandoned boats, had old containers and drums professionally removed, and have put new yard rules into place to keep things moving in the right direction. They have filled up several roll-off dumpsters with trash and debris from the yard, cleaning up from years of bad habits of previous land storage customers. The Bromans have also improved employee training and emergency preparedness to become a Clean Marina. Both new Clean Marinas have much to be proud of! !  Marina Partners. There is clearly a long way to go, and ecause an aim of the Clean Marina Initiative is to prevent considerably more participation is needed.

This is a multi-year investment that requires upkeep, but over time can turn a drab facility into a showcase. 3. Make facilities inviting to visitors. Signs directing visitors to docks or the marina office are welcoming to first-time visitors trying to locate a friend or family member 's boat. Remember that the appearance of the facility is a calling card to present and future customers. !  Few marina operators have time during the boating season to visit neighboring facilities and see what ""the other guys"" are doing . The Clean Marina staff, however, is continually visiting a variety of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs and has compiled a short list of marketing tips that can make a marina shine. 1. Make a good first impression. What does the entry to the marina look like from the water and the road? Does the facility project a professional image? Docks should be neat and clean, and old dock boards should be replaced regularly. Landside entrances should not contain dumpsters, spare parts, and the like. 2. Invest in landscaping whenever possible. Welltended flowerbeds, ornamental grasses, and buffers around parking areas serve three purposes.

Isabel's Impacts on Pumpouts Many marinas around the region either lost or experienced damage to their pumpout systems. To date, over 80 marinas have notified the Department that their pumpouts were affected by the storm. Some of these pumpouts are now operational, at least temporarily, and others are in the process of being replaced. The pumpout program's goal is to see as many units as possible back on line by the 2004 boating season. Repairing a pumpout, if possible, is preferable to complete replacement. Because many units were submerged in salt water for an extended period of time, there is an understandable concern about how long ""repaired"" pumpout units will continue to operate. At the same time, however, several marinas have taken advantage of pumpout operations and maintenance (O&M) funding to make their pumpouts operational in time for winter haul-outs. For pumpout units beyond repair, program staff request that marinas explore all insurance options before seeking a grant to replace the unit. For pumpouts that are both destroyed and uninsured, marinas may apply for a grant to replace it. For further information about pumpout O&M and pumpout replacement grants, contact Don O'Neill or Kristen Fleming at (410) 260-8770. Don may be reached at doneill@dnr.state.md.us and Kristen may be reached at kfleming@dnr.state.md.us. Grant information and applications are available on line at www.dnr.state.md.us/boating .

Marina program will again hold a series of introductory workshops for marina operators. They will be held in key locations around the State, but the content of each workshop will be the same. Each workshop will provide: 3.  An introduction to the structure and goals of the program,  An explanation of the steps to become a certified clean marina,  A Clean Marina Guidebook, Pledge, and Award Checklist for interested participants (no cost),  Solutions to common stumbling blocks to certification (i.e., templates for commonly needed plans at marinas and boatyards, marina Participants at the 2003 workshop in Annapolis management and staff and steps to certification as a Clean Marina. training tools); and  Free lunch! The clean marina program and workshops are designed for managers of all sizes and types of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs. Participants will walk away with many useful tools 4. for improving management of their facilities and a better understanding of the incentives to becoming certified. An owner or operator of a certified Clean Marina will speak about his or her experience in the program and how it has affected his or her business. This first-hand account should help explain the certification process for those who are unfamiliar. Advanced registration will be necessary and announcements and registration forms will be mailed directly to all marinas on the division's current mailing list. There will 5. be no charge to attend the workshops. While the workshops are an effective, concise way to learn about the goals and structure of the Clean Marina Initiative, marinas are welcome to join the program at any time. To review, the steps to certification are: 1. Sign the Clean Marina Pledge: By signing the Clean Marina Pledge marina and boatyard managers commit to do their part to ""keep Maryland's waterways free of harmful chemicals, excess nutrients and debris."" It is also a pledge to seek certification within one year of 6. signing , although there is no penalty if that goal is not met. At this step a press release is issued to local papers and the marina's name appears on the Clean Marina web site. Conduct a Self-Assessment: Using the Clean Marina Guidebook and Checklist, marina and boatyard operators run through the questions, and see how close they already are to certification and where they need improvement. Call Upon a Mentor : Invariably, questions of interpretation and applicability of the questions on the Checklist arise. A call to the office of either the Clean Marina program (410260-8770) or the Marine Trades Association (410-2690741) can easily answer many questions or, if needed, find a source to assist with technical questions. Additionally, the Clean Marina program staff can set up an informal walk through of a marina to help determine what they may need to become certified. Many templates are included learn about the benefits in the Guidebook (to assist with stormwater plans, emergency plans, and employee training) and confidential compliance assistance is also available to assist in permitting issues. Schedule a Confirmation Visit: After the ""mentoring"" stage, marina managers and program staff can be confident the facility is meeting the minimum scores in all areas of the Checklist. A confirmation visit, conducted by a Clean Marina program staff member and a manager of a certified clean marina, is completed to verify the items on the Checklist. Any deficiencies found do not result in a penalty, but rather with assistance to rectify them. Enjoy the Rewards: Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps. Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in displays at boat shows and in the newsletter. Maintain the Clean Marina Status: Annually, marinas confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards described on the Clean Marina Award Checklist. At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will revisit the facility to ensure it still meets award standards. !  Seven New Certified Clean Marinas! During the last few months seven marinas have completed their certification as Clean Marinas. This is a remarkable pace and will help the Clean Marina Initiative meet its goal of certifying 25 percent of the marinas in Maryland as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004. By doing so, the Department hopes to prevent further regulation of the industry. In September, Saefern Saddle and Yacht Club (Annapolis), Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort (Georgetown), and Worton Creek Marina (Chestertown) all became Clean Marinas. In November three more marinas and another yacht club joined the ranks: Chesapeake Yachting Center (Essex), Taylor 's Marina (Elkton), Hartge's Yacht Yard (Galesville), and Corinthian Yacht Club (Ridge). Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort and Worton Creek Marina both became certified as part of a recent round of Clean Marina cost- share grants (see page 2). While the grants helped fund wash water treatment systems at both marinas (one physical and one mechanical), both Rich Lauser (Skipjack Cove) and John & Libby Patnovic (Worton Creek) also improved their emergency planning and expanded their list of environmental rules for customers and staff. They also thoroughly reviewed necessary permits and plans, with help from the Clean Marina staff, and ensured all were up to date.

Most of what their Dockmaster, Robert Muir, did to earn the award was sharing emergency information and clean boating practices with the slip holders. He used not only printed material but the neighborhood's secure web site to make the information readily available and easy to update. The community has fully embraced the notion and are proud to be among the Clean Marinas in Maryland. Chesapeake Yachting Center is a full service facility with about 200 wet slips, 200 dry slips, a fuel dock and a whole host of services. To become certified, owner Frank Lampron and manager Russ Kirkhoff reviewed their required plans and permits, ensured they were all current, and improved their spill response kit and fueling procedures. They also improved written emergency response plans and stormwater management plans. Their attention to detail with the many plans and permits required for marinas that store fuel and haul boats, was especially important to their success. Taylor 's Marina, by contrast, is a small and simple Robert Muir, Saefern Saddle & Yacht marina owned by Mary and Dick Guttendorf, who Club, with the community's award. also operate nearby Locust Point Marina (also a Clean Marina). Taylor 's Marina simply offers slips, with water and electricity, and access to all the repair services at Locust Point. There is also a pool and a small-engine repair shop on site. The Guttendorf 's smartly carried over all their emergency plans and ""environmental rules"" for customers and contractors to Taylor 's customers. The marinas also share the use of a portable pump-out which has proven convenient for both sets of customers. Corinthian Yacht Club is only the second independent yacht club to become a certified Clean Marina. (The John and Libby Patnovic, owners of first was Baltimore Yacht Club.) This Worton Creek Marina, with their award. helps to dispel the notion that the Clean Marina program is only for marinas and boatyards; more yacht clubs are encouraged to participate. The yacht club is also a relatively simple operation-- no fuel or boatyard. However, they have a club house, several piers (both covered and uncovered), a pool, and several cottages that members can rent for short term use. To earn the award members Ron Riland and Earl Waesche, with club support, created a set of environmental rules and practices for both members and contractors, and promoted the recycling of used oil, antifreeze, batteries and other waste by posting directions to the nearest collection facility in a prominent location. Hartge Yacht Yard is a well-respected facility that has served boaters around the West River area for generations. This facility has about 200 slips, a fuel dock, and a multitude of boating services (i.e., rigging , fiberglass, woodshop) on site. Manager Alex Schlegel made some improvements to his stormwater management controls, and repaired damage previously done by stormwater, as part of his certification. He and his staff also included Clean Boating Tip Sheets (from the Clean Marina Guidebook) in mailings to all customers, to enlist their help in keeping the yard clean. They routinely use filter cloth and dustless sanders on all boats having major work done. They also recycle used oil, batteries, and aluminum cans. All these facilities serve as notable examples of the conservation ethic: individual responsibility for healthy land and water. The Clean Marina program thanks all those involved in these certifications and encourages other facilities to call the office to learn more. Informal visits are the best way to start on the As reported in the Autumn issue of Under way, The path to certification and streamline the process.

GX253-42-8683509	The Clean Marina Initiative is working with the engineering firm of Purdum and Jeschke to help marinas come into compliance with a federal regulation that requires certain facilities to have engineer-certified oil spill prevention, control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans. Any marina, boatyard or yacht club that stores greater than 660 gallons of oil in a single above ground tank, an aggregate of 1,320 gallons above ground, or greater than 42,000 gallons underground is required to have an SPCC plan. The term oil refers to all petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, solvents, and waste oil. The Clean Marina Initiative has developed a template and hired an engineering firm to certify plans at no cost to marinas. The template is available on the Clean Marina web site (www.dnr.state.md.us/boating) or by calling 410-260-8770. Submit the completed template to the Clean Marina office along with a current Clean Marina Pledge and a completed Clean Marina Award Checklist. DNR staff will then authorize contact with Purdum and Jeschke for plan review and certification. Priority for this service will be given to facilities that meet the Clean Marina criteria in all aspects except the SPCC requirement.

Governor Sarah Taylor-Rogers, Secretary Elizabeth Fuller Valentine, Editor Donna Morrow, Layout Barbara MacLeod, Copy Editor  UNDERW JUNE 2001 4 The Clean Marina Initiative has formed an alliance with a new, online marina reservation and slip management service. The partnership between the Clean Marina Initiative and Marinalife.com represents another opportunity for certified Clean Marinas to reach potential customers. Marinalife has developed Internet-based slip management software for marina operators. The Slip Manager Software allows managers to automate their entire reservation process including managing slip inventory, customers and leases. The software offers numerous features such as real time slip updates, invoicing capabilities, and customized reports. Marinalife also hosts a marina locator service through which boaters can search for facilities in particular areas with particular features. For instance, a boater can search for a marina in Annapolis with a fuel dock and laundry facilities by completing a simple form online. A list of marinas fitting the search criteria appears within seconds after hitting the send button. Boaters can then make reservations via the Internet at any Marinalife member marina. The Maryland Clean Marina logo, with a link to additional information about the program, will be clearly displayed next to every certified Clean Marina that is a Marinalife member. In addition, Clean Marina certification will soon be one of the criteria boaters can select when using the marina reservation and locator service. This feature will allow boaters to consciously seek out and patronize facilities that have met the Clean Marina Initiatives high standards. For more information about Marinalife, visit www.marinalife.com or call (410) 752-0505. ]  Maryland Clean Marinas  AY  Clean Marina Forms Partnership with Marinalife.com Boating Infrastructure Grant Program The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will inaugurate the new Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program with the first round of awards this summer. The BIG program will provide $32 million to states and territories to construct, renovate or maintain tie-up facilities for recreational boats 26 feet or more in length. For Maryland, this means that a minimum of $400,000 will be available for projects such as mooring buoys, day-docks, navigational aids, transient slips, safe harbors, floating docks and fixed piers, floating and fixed breakwaters, dinghy docks, restrooms, retaining walls, bulkheads, dockside utilities, pumpout stations, recycling and trash receptacles, dockside pay telephones, debris deflection booms, and marine fueling stations. DNRs Waterway Improvement Program solicited proposals from state, county and municipal contacts for the first round of grant funding . They received requests for $1.5 million. DNR staff then selected a handful of the proposed projects to submit to USFWS for the $200,000 of funding that is available to Maryland this year. While private facilities were not asked to apply for this first round of funding , they may be invited to submit proposals in the future. Decisions on future projects to fund with both BIG monies and Waterway Improvement Funds* will take into consideration the results of a survey of boating infrastructure needs that will be conducted by the University of Baltimore this summer. University researchers will actually survey four groups:  Owners of vessels 26 feet or more in length (generally non-trailerable boats),  Owners of vessels less than 26 feet in length (generally trailerable boats),  Operators of facilities catering to boats 26 feet or more in length, and  Operators of facilities catering to boats under 26 feet in length. They will investigate boaters current use patterns, compile information about existing tie-up facilities and their conditions, identify boater access needs and preferences, assess factors that inhibit boating in specific areas, and list congested areas. The survey results will serve as the basis for a statewide plan. To learn more about the BIG program, contact Beth Fuller Valentine at (410) 260-8776. ] * The Waterway Improvement Fund is supported by boat excise taxes and a small percentage of the state motor fuel tax. The fund provides money to local, state and federal government agencies for a wide variety of capital projects to serve the boating public.

Over the past three months, six facilities have been certified as Clean Marinas and two others as Clean Marina Partners. Congratulations to the owners and staff of Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina, Chesapeake Harbour Marina, Mears Marina and Hartge Yacht Services, Mears Point Marina, Spring Cove Marina (Rock Hall), Tidewater Marina, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and Rocky Gap State Park. Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina is the first noncommercial, community marina to meet the Clean Marina criteria. It has 116 slips and 8 moorings. As part of his efforts to achieve Clean Marina certification, Bay Ridge resident and Dockmaster Ken Karsten included clean boating information in the community s monthly newsletter. Instead of educating just the slip holders, we went the extra mile and trained over 400 households in the practices necessary to meet the Maryland Clean Marina guidelines, Karsten said. At Chesapeake Harbour Marina in Annapolis, General Manager George Colligan asks his customers not to discharge their sewage treatment systems within the marina basin. Sewage discharge treated by on-board systems still contains nutrients and possibly toxic chemicals and pathogens. Within a confined area like a marina these elements can degrade water quality.  There is an obvious connection between clean water and recreational boating , said Colligan. We need to do our part to protect the Chesapeake Bay. Mears Marina in Annapolis has over 230 slips and a boatyard that is managed independently of the marina. Marina Manager Desiree Bell and Louis Hartge of Hartge Yacht Services worked together to meet the Clean Marina award criteria. Under the guidance of Assistant Marina Manager Nancy Bray, both the marina and the boatyard have refined their pollution prevention measures. For example, Ms. Bray developed new environmental policies for all marina customers and Mr. Hartge uses filter fabric to prevent particles dislodged by pressure washing from running into the creek. Mears Point Marina in Grasonville is a full service marina complete with maintenance facilities, health club, and restaurant. The managers of Mears Po int Marina have developed comprehensive environmental management regulations. These rules are incorporated into all contracts: slips rentals, transient dockage, dry land storage, and outside contractors. One rule is that all boat owners who live aboard their vessels are required to have a contract with a company that provides dockside sewage pumpouts.  We emphasize to our customers that clean water is their responsibility, as well as ours, noted Dockmaster Jay Jones. By participating in the Clean Marina Initiative we are doing what we can to minimize the impacts of recreational boating on the health of the Bay. Although she does not sell fuel, Madelyn Reni, owner of Spring Cove Marina in Rock Hall, is prepared for a petroleum spill. In the event of an accidental spill, say from an onboard fuel leak that is pumped overboard by an automatic bilge pump, she has response equipment on site. She keeps oil absorbent pads and booms in a readily accessible container that can easily be taken out to the docks if necessary.

They are pleased to be part of the effort to protect the Chesapeake Bay. Tidewater Marina in Havre de Grace is a full service boating facility. In addition to wet and dry storage, boat sales, a store and a fuel dock, Tidewater offers a comprehensive line of services including haul-out, bottom painting , blister repair, rigging , engine repair, fiberglass, air conditioning and refrigeration, finish carpentry, electrical, plumbing , and electronics. With all of this activity going on, Manager Jeff Andrews has to insure that pollutants are not accidentally washed or blown into the water. As part of his efforts, Andrews requires that all workers use vacuum sanders, tarps, or tents to contain dust from sanding . Sand blasting must be conducted in an on-site containment stall. Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels is the first museum to be named a Maryland Clean Marina Partner. The Clean Marina Partner designation indicates that the museum managers minimize pollution from their own operations and actively promote clean boating habits. For example, at the counter where transient boaters register for slips there is a display  featuring clean boating tips. Dockmaster Robin Newberg is also prepared for an emergency. She has compiled two binders of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). One binder is kept in the boat shop and the other is in the museum admissions building . Additionally, Ms. Newberg has put together a third binder with just the health sections of MSDS sheets so that the most relevant information is readily available in case of overexposure to any chemical kept on-site. Rocky Gap State Park in Flintstone operates two boat ramps on a lake. The only two gasoline engines allowed on the lake are both on DNR vessels: one a rescue boat and the other a pontoon tour boat. The pontoon boat is equipped with a low-emission four-stroke engine. Compared to twostroke engines that may discharge a quarter of their fuel unburnt, four-stroke engines operate much more efficiently; generate substantially less smoke, fumes, and noise; and have easier starting , faster acceleration, and quicker throttle response. All of these facilities are truly making a difference and helping to protect the health of Marylands waterways.
