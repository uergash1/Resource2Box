Congress, in a bipartisan response, has introduced a wide range of programs and policies to improve U.S. competitiveness. Whether focused on building a 21st-century infrastructure, stimulating technological innovation and commercialization, improving the business climate for investment and growth, supporting education and training, or promoting trade, these policies start with assumptions, often implicit, about the competitive position of U.S. industry. Meeting the Challenge: U.S. Industry Faces the 21st Century is a new series of studies, produced by the Department of Commerce's Office of Technology Policy, that assesses the competitive position of a number of major U.S. industries and the factors influencing their growth. Drawing principally from the experience and insight of the private sector, some 150 experts from over 30 organizations in industry, academia, and government have contributed to the drafting and review of the studies. Overall, the studies provide a framework for public policy that is better informed and that more accurately reflects the shifting, and often improving, competitive position of U.S. industry. This report on the U.S. automobile manufacturing industry concentrates on the Big 3 firms (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) and discusses the condition of the industry, product and production strategies, the importance of the supply chain, distribution and retailing, and conclusions and possible future directions. It suggests that, although the U.S. industry (and the Big 3 in particular) has made tremendous progress in the past 15 years, new challenges are clear as the global market, technology, and industry structure continue to evolve. For example, the fastest growing markets are in countries that are developing an auto industry of their own. And as the report makes clear, best practice is easily transferred to emerging producers. New technologies are also being introduced, often in response to the challenges posed by environmental and safety regulations. In addition, the major producers are experiencing structural pressures as suppliers produce a larger fraction of the finished product's value, and well-financed and independent organizations threaten the traditional distribution networks on which producers rely to sell their products.  Graham R. Mitchell Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology Policy The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 5   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  M  IT's International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) was asked to develop this study in parallel with industry reports in other sectors to provide strategic assessments of key U.S. industries to government policymakers. Drawing on the experience and expertise of several dozen IMVP-affiliated researchers from around the world and numerous industry participants, this study reports on the U.S. automotive industry in the context of the world automotive industry.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  7   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  EXECUTIVE S  UMMARY  The Automotive Industry Today: A Global Endeavor hile sometimes characterized as ""mature,"" the U.S. automotive industry continues to experience dynamic change--change that sweeps across national borders. To succeed, auto manufacturers must manage large and complex supply chains, spanning many geographic regions, and pursue opportunities in diverse national markets. While national policies play an important role in shaping the environment for local manufacturing operations and resulting products, cost competition increasingly drives the industry toward global product offerings. This report explores several important dimensions of the forces of change facing the industry and reviews the responses of the Big 3 manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) to those forces.  W  Forces of Change in the U.S. Market Important changes are under way in the U.S. market, both in the type of vehicles preferred by consumers and in the system that delivers those vehicles to consumers. Equally important, foreign firms are opening new assembly plants in the United States, and foreign suppliers of parts and components are building a domestic presence. In response to shifting consumer preferences, the variety of products supplied by the automotive industry has increased dramatically. Lifestyles have shifted toward the two-wage-earner family, and as a result, demand for light utility vehicles has surged. In addition, consumers have shown increasing interest in both safety and performance. At the same time, average new-vehicle transaction prices have continued to rise at a rate far higher than the increase in average household income, posing a serious challenge for the industry. Dramatic change is also taking place in the ""downstream"" activities of the automotive industry--distribution and retailing. These activities represent 20 to 30 percent of the value of a new vehicle and are an important potential source of cost savings. The changes in this area reflect a shift from capital-intensive operations (involving inventory investment) to information-intensive operations (providing the right vehicle in the right place at the right time). This shift is leading to the development of The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 9   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  flexible and highly entrepreneurial structures and methods to serve customers. Finally, new assembly plants operated by Japanese and German auto manufacturers have been built in the United States, introducing additional competitive challenges for the Big 3. Because of their location, they have also altered the regional distribution of automotive employment. These new ""transplant"" manufacturing facilities have been accompanied by the arrival of new suppliers from the home markets of these manufacturers. The presence of these new suppliers has benefited both the new assemblers and the Big 3 by introducing additional competition into the supply of automotive parts.  Competitive Responses of Big 3 Manufacturers The Big 3 have responded to these forces of change in a variety of ways. Most important, they have dramatically improved both the quality of their products and the productivity of their operations. This study shows that Big 3 plants improved their productivity from 24.1 to 20.7 direct labor hours per vehicle between 1989 and 1994--a 17 percent improvement. While Japanese-owned plants in Japan improved more slowly, they still remain the most efficient producers--but by a relatively smaller margin. From a broader perspective, the productivity data underline the need for continuous improvement in these areas, evidencing the convergence of average performance across the world. European plants improved their productivity nearly 30 percent, and new entrant countries (Korea and Mexico) showed significant improvement as well. Equally important, the data show that productivity varied widely within each regional group, suggesting a disparity among regional competitors in the management of vehicle production. The Big 3 have recognized that the development of new products is of special importance as manufacturers struggle to respond to the demand for product variety and low prices. Since the 1980s, these companies have shortened the time required to bring a new product to market and decreased the engineering effort required for new products. The large differences among the three companies in their approach to this challenge--in terms of the involvement of suppliers, organizational structures, and the degree of coordination among different product offerings--are explored in this study. 10 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Human resource practices represent another important determinant of the auto industry's competitiveness. There appears to be wide variance among U.S. manufacturers in this area--ranging from traditional labormanagement practices to new and unique management structures. The rate of diffusion of new practices within the United States is slow, but research presented here suggests that several important changes are occurring: (1) decreases in inventory buffers; (2) increases in the use of teams, job rotation, and worker suggestion programs; and (3) use of contingent compensation, training investment, and other human resource practices. A final area of competitive response in which each of the Big 3 is developing its own unique approach is the management of supply chains. Earlier research suggested that management of automotive supply chains was improved by the development of close relationships among auto manufacturers and suppliers who develop and produce components and subsystems. Recent events suggest a number of key issues in the management of these relationships. The nature of the relationship may vary with the supplier's degree of involvement in the development of parts for the manufacturer. Each of the Big 3 companies is pursuing a different approach in this area based on its corporate experience and strengths.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  11   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  INTRODUCTION  T  his report discusses the U.S. automotive manufacturing industry in the context of the world industry. The first section discusses the status of the U.S. automobile manufacturing industry, concentrating on the performance of the Big 3. Then market forces and production trends in the industry are addressed, focusing primarily on the geography of automotive production. The next section reports on competitiveness and product strategy, particularly in the areas of automotive manufacturing and product development, the two areas where the best data are available. The following section highlights technical areas where improvements and innovations are needed to make the next generation of vehicles possible. The dynamics of the adoption and evolution of lean production practices are then discussed. Two sections address supply chain issues looking upstream of the manufacturing plant, as well as downstream from the manufacturing plant to automobile distribution and retailing. A final discussion covers several ""social agenda"" issues such as mobility, environment, and safety. The last section provides the report's conclusions.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  13   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  STATUS  OF THE INDUSTRY  L  ike a number of long-established U.S. industries, the automobile manufacturing industry has gone through wrenching times in the past 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless, the U.S. industry is still home to the two largest vehicle manufacturers in the world, General Motors and Ford (table 1), and has been responsible for 20 to 25 percent of world vehicle production in several years since 1980 (figure 1). Over the past few years, the United States has closed the gap with Japan with respect to the volume of domestically produced passenger cars (figure 2) and overtaken Japan in the increasingly important sector of Trucks, Buses, and Others (figure 3). In this sector, which includes the popular light trucks, minivans, and utility vehicles, U.S. producers are considered market leaders. The U.S. Big 3 have recently gained market share in domestic passenger car sales (figure 4), from 61 percent in 1991 to 64 percent in 1994. Transplants have also increased their share, from 14 percent in 1991 to 17 percent in 1994. Despite these gains--which were made at the expense of imports--the United States is running a well-publicized trade deficit of $50 billion (as of 1994) in the motor vehicle sector. The $89 billion of production by foreign affiliates of the Big 3 (figure 5) is less well known, and although it does not solve the trade deficit problem, it does put the U.S. industry's position in the world in perspective. Through the past 15 years, the Big 3 have maintained the confidence of financial markets--their market capitalization has kept pace with the capitalization of Standard & Poor's Industrials (figure 6). Over the years, the return on assets of the Big 3 has generally been below par (figure 7) in spite of their efforts to increase profitability and efficiency. One of the casualties of these efforts has been employment, which has decreased substantially since the late 1980s (figure 8).  The U.S. Big 3 have recently gained market share in domestic passenger car sales.

Detroit automakers have been able to respond much more quickly to this demand for a range of models with the adoption of lean production. The average time to market or ""lead time"" of U.S. automakers has fallen from about 61 months to about 52 months--below the Japanese average, which actually increased from 45 to 55 months from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. As a result, U.S. companies can now compete with the Japanese in product development. Lead time may already be significantly faster at Chrysler than at many of the Japanese companies. However, American manufacturers` competitive disadvantage in model mix complexity creates a barrier to their ability to compete in product diversity. The continuous rise in price of new cars is an ominous trend for all automakers. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average new-vehicle transaction price has soared from $8,850 to $19,200 since 1981. Median U.S. household income, however, has increased from $22,400 to only $37,800. Therefore, car buyers now pay a higher percentage of their annual income to purchase new cars. The increasing costs are forcing consumers into alternative buying and replacement strategies--retaining cars longer and purchasing used cars instead of new cars. American family lifestyles have also changed. There are more working women, which has changed commuting and errand-driving patterns. Families once had a commuting car for the wage earner and a larger car for family use. Often now they have two wage earners instead of one, and the second family vehicle is a minivan or utility vehicle to supplement the family car. U.S. automakers have been very effective in creating and supplying this new market, excelling in minivans, light trucks, and recreational vehicles. Light trucks are not only popular in the American automotive market, but also highly profitable for Detroit's automakers. They are relatively inexpensive to build, and their price has been high due to customer demand and relatively few viable Japanese competitors. Light trucks are predominantly a U.S. market and have captured nearly 50 percent of the entire U.S. automotive market. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 21  U.S. companies can now compete with the Japanese in product development.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Another trend influencing the automotive industry is consumer preference for certain features. Consumers are choosing safety (e.g., airbags, antilock brake systems) with amenities (e.g., air conditioners, powerful engines, power steering, and compact disc players) over vehicles whose primary appeal is size and interior space. Factors influencing customer choices are performance, suitability to personal needs, and family lifestyle, safety, comfort, and appearance. Consumers are showing a taste for the practical, as embodied in the Toyota Camry and the Ford Taurus, both top sellers in the medium price range. Japanese automakers, however, have increased market share in the United States through new ""luxury"" nameplates: Lexus, Infiniti, and Acura. In addition, previously ""compact"" models such as Toyota's Camry and Honda's Accord have become larger and more luxurious.  The Geography of Production: Global Sourcing and Factory Transplants  In automotive development and manufacturing, geography plays a major role.  In automotive development and manufacturing, geography plays a major role. Historically, automotive employment has been tightly clustered, with major concentrations in Nagoya, Detroit, and Stuttgart, for example. In more recently developed infrastructures, we also observe very tight clustering--in the midwestern United States, we see a tight concentration of the Japanese assembly transplants and transplant suppliers.1 In the new transplant clusters, the philosophy of just-in-time (JIT) seems to play an important role in location decisions: All of the suppliers want to be near their assembler customers to achieve short, fast supply lines--just like in Toyota City. We also see recent trends of ""de-clustering,"" however. In search of cheaper or different labor forces, manufacturers from Europe, North America, and Japan have all built plants in Mexico. Thailand, Spain, and Eastern Europe--each quite distant from a historical automotive cluster--have attracted significant investment as well. Toyota even built a major plant in Kyushu, Japan, several hundred kilometers south of Toyota City, in search of an expanded labor base. These patterns raise a puzzle for analysts. In particular, why did JIT supply lines matter before and not now? Has a critical level of learning transpired such that geographic closeness is no longer important? Are only the suppliers of noncritical components moving south? If so, what defines criticality for geographic closeness? 1  Richard Florida and Martin Kenney, ""The Globalization of Japanese R&D: The Economic Geography of Japanese R&D Investment in the United States,"" Economic Geography 70, no. 4 (1994).  22  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Furthermore, if network clustering is important, as the Florida-Kenney work on the midwest auto industry suggests, then one might have expected the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to reduce the incentive to build cars or parts in Mexico, since free trade guarantees that companies can eventually ship south as much as they want. However, it is not clear what role, if any, network clustering has played in post-NAFTA decisions concerning plant location. What new light does this fact shed on the importance of the network clustering? All of these questions are critical to regional economic development. If attracting a manufacturing plant guarantees that a swarm of suppliers will follow, then it may pay for states to offer incentives to attract the manufacturing plants, as many states have done. On the other hand, if suppliers chase low wages, other government strategies make sense. If some suppliers go toward low wages and others must be close to the manufacturers, then governments must consider what mix of companies they should try to attract or should reasonably hope to attract. In Korea, India, Eastern Europe, Thailand, Brazil, and many other developing countries, the growth rate of automotive sales now far outpaces those of the traditional automotive manufacturing and consuming areas of Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Furthermore, these developing countries typically want to fill domestic demand with domestic production, driving multinational automobile firms and suppliers to develop local manufacturing capabilities to serve local markets. Following the policies that these governments pursue and watching how automobile and supplier companies respond to these government initiatives will be informative for U.S. policy makers, who may also be concerned with automotive employment shifts.  If some suppliers go toward low wages and others must be close to the manufacturers, then governments must consider what mix of companies they should try to attract or should reasonably hope to attract.  Foreign Transplants in the United States The combination of high national productivity and the relative decrease in value of the dollar against the yen and the deutsche mark has made the United States a more attractive manufacturing site for foreign automakers. This development has provided a new source of investment, jobs, and training for Americans. Moreover, the transplant assemblers are significantly influencing the U.S. automotive supply base, both by encouraging traditional Japanese and German suppliers to set up transplant operations and by inciting the traditional U.S. suppliers to become more competitive. These improvements to the supply base, driven in part by the Japanese transplants, in turn benefit the Big 3. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 23   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The transplants represent an enormous positive economic impact for the United States, compared with having that many vehicles imported from Japan, for example.  The Japanese-transplant assemblers in North America have continued to expand their production and are now approaching a volume of three million cars and light trucks per year (up from two million units in 1991). The transplants represent an enormous positive economic impact for the United States, compared with having that many vehicles imported from Japan, for example. These investments have helped the Japanese companies as well, which would be in far deeper trouble had they not diversified their manufacturing base outside the high-priced labor and parts markets in Japan. The displacement of Big 3 employment and production with transplant production is more difficult to assess. In the main, it has decreased the financial and market dominance of the Big 3, although none are currently threatened with survival concerns. It has also affected the geography of automotive employment within the United States.  Investment in Developing Countries In the foreseeable future, most automotive demand in the United States, Japan, and Western Europe will be for replacement vehicles. Demand will be flat or grow slowly. In the developing world, however, demand is skyrocketing, and many governments are requiring the establishment of domestic production to satisfy this demand. As a result, the world's major multinational auto companies are pouring significant fractions of their investment funds into capacity in China, India, South America, and Southeast Asia. For example, Ford is spending approximately $1 billion to set up factories in China and Southeast Asia. General Motors (GM) has invested heavily in building up China's part-making facilities. Last fall, GM pledged a fresh $130 million for three parts facilities in Shanghai. Overall, GM has agreed to set up 25 components-making ventures valued in hundreds of millions of dollars in China. GM also has been chosen to participate in a $1 billion deal to make luxury cars in China and has announced a $1 billion assembly plant investment in Thailand. In Southeast Asia, the Japanese have a huge lead and are likely to continue dominating that market. India and China are still wide open, with GM, Chrysler, Peugeot-Citron (PSA), Isuzu, and Volkswagen having early status in China. The Europeans and Americans are probably stronger in Latin America than the Japanese. All of these markets are in early stages of development, however, and significant change should be expected. All of the major players seem to be seeking to craft a global strategy aimed at the developing world, and these areas will be critical battlegrounds in the coming decade.  24  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  COMPETITIVENESS  AND  P  RODUCT  S  TRATEGY  ne of the most critical issues for the automotive industry today is competitiveness in cost, quality, and product offerings. Companies cannot survive in today's market if they neglect any of these areas. In The Machine That Changed the World, published in 1990, the International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) documented significant differences in these areas between the best- and worst-performing plants and companies. Since that time, differences between the United States and Japan in productivity and quality have shrunk and effectively disappeared in new product development lead time, pointing to a dramatic overall improvement in the competitive position of the Big 3 firms.  O  Manufacturing Plant Performance The automobile is one of the most complex consumer products in existence. The automotive manufacturing process serves as the ""moment of truth"" for the entire design, development, supply chain, and manufacturing process. If the parts do not fit when the manufacturer attempts to put them together, the system has a defect that must be tracked down and eliminated. Thus, auto companies focus a great deal of attention on understanding and improving the manufacturing process. Across the world auto industry, the differences in regional averages in quality, productivity, and diversity are declining. Within regions, however, the variance in performance is high, with large gaps between the best and worst plants. Below, we report highlights from the assembly plant performance research, both from the study of 1989 (Round 1) and from the recent replication and expansion of the analysis with 1994 data (Round 2). Productivity Performance In 1986, the IMVP developed an innovative methodology for normalizing differences in vehicle designs and plant practices to enhance comparison of productivity among plants making different vehicles with a variety of manufacturing practices and methods. This methodology has been improved in the 1990s and, we believe, allows reasonable comparisons across disparate plants and vehicles. Due to widespread improvement in North American manufacturing plants, the performance gap between average U.S. and Japanese plants has narrowed considerably. Big 3 plants are not the only ones that have improved over this period. Korean plants and Japanese plants in North America have shown considerable gains. European plants have shown The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 25  The automobile is one of the most complex consumer products in existence.  Due to widespread improvement in North American manufacturing plants, the performance gap between average U.S. and Japanese plants has narrowed considerably.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 9. Scale = Weighted Productivity Averages for Matched Sample of Plants, 1989 and 1994  the greatest percentage improvement in productivity of any region, partly because of a strong push toward adoption of lean production and partly because they had lagged so far behind the Japanese and North American plants. Figures 9 through 13 depict international productivity trends from 1989 to 1994. The full 1989 sample comprises 62 plants from 24 companies and 20 countries, while the full 1994 sample comprises 75 plants from 20 companies and 20 countries. Figure 9 shows that the U.S.-owned (Big 3) plants in North America (both United States and Canada) improved their productivity by 17 percent-- from 24.1 to 20 hours per vehicle. In comparison, Japanese-owned plants in Japan showed only a 5.8 percent improvement over this period, from 15.6 to 14.7 hours per vehicle. However, the relatively low percentage improvement of the Japanese plants cannot be construed too negatively. The Japanese still produce cars faster than any other manufacturer, and on average they assemble a car over five hours faster than the Big 3 (i.e., in 25 percent less time). In addition, these averages mask far greater gains achieved by some Japanese plants, such as Toyota's RAV4 line in Motomachi. 26 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 10. Productivity Performance within Regional Group, 1994  Improvements for groups of plants other than the Big 3 were also impressive. European plants made a nearly 30 percent gain in productivity, dropping their hours per vehicle from 37.8 to 26.5--about where the U.S. automakers were five years ago. Among the plants in new entrant countries (mostly in Korea but also in Mexico, Taiwan, and Brazil), productivity increased by nearly 14 percent, from 34.4 to 29.6 hours per vehicle-- not far behind the current European average. Japanese-owned plants in North America, the ""transplants,"" improved their productivity by 19.5 percent. The regional averages above conceal considerable variation in productivity across plants within each region. Figure 10 reveals the extent of this variation, showing the average, minimum, and maximum hours per vehicle for plants in each region. The range is quite large in some regions--the best plant in Japan is more than twice as productive as the worst plant, and the same is true among Big 3 plants. This fact suggests major differences across plants within these countries. Indeed, differences in company-level capabilities are likely to be far more significant for productivity than country differences. Thus Europe's wide range of productivity performance may reflect its range of company capabilities more than its country differences. The smallest range is found among the The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 27  Improvements for groups of plants other than the Big 3 were also impressive.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Japanese transplants, which may reflect their common status as greenfield plants adjusting to the U.S. context. Quality Performance  Much of the quality gap between Japanese companies and their American and European competitors has been closed.  Quality performance trends are similar to those for productivity. Much of the quality gap between Japanese companies and their American and European competitors has been closed. However, the variation among plants in each regional group is large. (At this point, all quality data refer only to vehicles sold in the United States. No comparable data exist for vehicles sold in other regions.) The dominant trend in figure 11 is convergence toward a quality level of 60 defects per 100 vehicles, with the exception of the new entrant group of plants whose quality worsened over this period. The greatest improvement is shown by European plants (33 percent) and by Big 3 plants in North America (26.7 percent). While this improvement closed much of the quality gap with Japanese competitors, Japanese plants improved in Japan (13 percent fewer defects) and in North America (18 percent fewer defects) during this period. The North American transplants have eliminated any gap in quality performance with their sister plants in Japan. The other notable trend is the worsening quality at the new entrant plants. From 1989 to 1991, defects increased nearly 50 percent, primarily because of a period of labor conflict in the Korean industry following national political changes. The Korean automakers are already showing signs of returning to more competitive levels of quality, although they still lag behind the other regional groups. Figure 12 shows the range of quality within each region. Here the range of performance within regions is even greater than for productivity. A wide range exists for the Japanese companies in Japan, with a threefold difference in the number of defects per 100 vehicles between the best and worst plants. While the best Japanese companies have grown stronger in terms of quality performance, the pressures of the extended recession on the Japanese industry are reflected in quality problems for the weaker companies. The range in quality performance is also quite wide for the Big 3 plants in North America, with a nearly three-to-one differential in defects between the worst and best plants. While some of this variation is specific to certain types of products (e.g., sports cars tend to have the highest number of reported defects), overall it reflects persistent differences in plant capabilities for achieving quality. The narrowest range in performance for quality is for the European plants. 28 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 11. Quality Levels across Regions, 1989 and 1994  Figure 12. Range of Quality Performance within Regions, 1994  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  29   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Plants that improve quality through inspection will not only incur higher costs but will also have less long-term continuous improvement in quality than those that eliminate the sources of problems.  The divergence in quality performance reflected at the regional level may also reflect differences in company strategies for achieving quality. Some plants and companies, in the United States and elsewhere, have boosted quality through additional expenditures on post-process inspection and repair; others have been more successful at building it right the first time. Plants that improve quality through inspection will not only incur higher costs but will also have less long-term continuous improvement in quality than those that eliminate the sources of problems. Making Multiple Product Lines in a Single Plant The strategic advantages of manufacturing flexibility (the ability to assemble multiple product lines in a single plant) have been widely discussed over the past decade. Companies that are able to produce a variety of products in their manufacturing plants have a number of advantages. Such plants are an important resource for a company with a product development strategy of high variety. In addition, flexibility enables plants to respond more effectively to changes in their competitive environment. The manufacturing plants with the highest levels of product variety have typically been those that produce many different models for export-- Japanese plants in Japan and European plants. Big 3 plants in North America have typically been dedicated to one or a few models. The Japanese transplants started their operations in North America with low product variety while they established their production system philosophy and have slowly increased variety over time. Figure 13 shows the regional averages in the IMVP's International Assembly Plant Study, Round 2, for product variety (model mix complexity) based on the number of different platforms (e.g., the core design, comprising a common chassis and wheelbase), different models (e.g., Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable), and different body styles (e.g., two-door, fourdoor) built in a given plant. Model mix complexity is quite high for Japanese plants in Japan, with the next highest complexity level among plants in Europe and the Japanese transplants. Big 3 plants in North America and new entrant plants have lower levels of product variety. Japanese plants in Japan, which are highest in both quality and productivity, are also highest in flexibility. These data reinforce the earlier finding that the firms need not choose among these objectives, but can instead find strategies whereby the objectives are mutually reinforcing.  Flexibility enables plants to respond more effectively to changes in their competitive environment.  30  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 13. Model Mix Complexity, 1994  Summary on Manufacturing Plant Performance Japanese plants are still the best at automotive manufacturing by our evaluation standards. However, the gaps are rapidly closing, and the rising yen has eliminated any cost advantages that Japan once had. Like many others, the manufacturing segment of the business has become increasingly competitive. No firm can relax its efforts for continual and significant improvement.  Product Development Performance Automakers continually face the challenge to create ""best in class"" vehicles and maintain a corporate reputation for performance and value. To achieve this goal, they must be adept at managing the development process, including involving suppliers as design partners. Product development includes understanding customer needs and desires; translating those needs into ""key characteristics""; developing the concepts, systems, components, and tools to deliver those key characteristics; and designing the immense logistical systems required to deliver vehicles in quantity at competitive cost and quality. Over the past decade, U.S. automakers have popularized the minivan and sport utility/light truck vehicle classes. Continued success will result from The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 31  The manufacturing segment of the business has become increasingly competitive. No firm can relax its efforts for continual and significant improvement.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  attention to demographic trends, customer tastes, design innovation, and transportation needs. American automakers must maintain the simultaneous abilities to advance the state of the design art, respond to new or latent purchaser demands, and continually refine existing vehicle types. Automotive firms continually explore better ways to organize themselves to perform these challenging product development functions. This section describes some of those organizational strategies as well as performance outcomes. Alternate Development Structures Four patterns or strategies of vehicle development management practice are described below: functional management; single-car project management; multiproject management; and multifirm, multiproject management. Functional management is characterized by teams of specialists within largely independent and isolated technical and business areas following sequential development phases to create a new product.  Multifirm, multiproject management requires the complicated act of juggling component sharing arrangements, joint project ventures, and agreements to market cars under each other's brand names.  Single-car project management is the use of overlapped, integrated functions and program phases to improve communication and lessen the amount of change and re-work caused by changed or incompatible design priorities. Typically, this management structure is associated with a project manager who has significant authority and responsibility over the entire team developing the vehicle. Multiproject-management attempts to leverage the advantages of single project management on multiple projects. Firms develop a portfolio of vehicle products with common features or a related design. Various products are related in terms of platform architecture, component families, and development lineage. Multifirm, multiproject management, under which a firm integrates its development and operational activities with those of other firms, is the most difficult and demanding product management strategy. Multifirm, multiproject management requires the complicated act of juggling component sharing arrangements, joint project ventures, and agreements to market cars under each other's brand names. To support multiproject management, the basic design of one vehicle platform is often leveraged for another through the process of ""rapid design transfer,"" in which major structures or assemblies are reused in 32 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  follow-on projects. The benefits of such practices are greater product variety, lower average design age throughout the corporate vehicle portfolio, more efficient use of development resources, and a higher level of component commonality. The difficulties include cross-project coordination and design compromises that yield multiproduct savings but distinct vehicles. A number of firms have installed a heavyweight coordinator who serves as the executive manager over a set of projects in order to address the delicate balance between individual projects and linked platforms. Product Development Performance Metrics The research team of Ellison, Clark, Fujimoto, and Hyun2 has developed a rich database to examine product development performance over the past decade. In comparing new product development practices in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Korea, they have collected data on two key measures of performance for automotive product development projects: total engineering hours devoted to the development project and total months of lead time from concept to market for new vehicle projects. The metrics calculated from the raw data are adjusted for factors such as product complexity, new parts content, and supplier development content in an attempt to approximate an ""apples to apples"" comparison. In table 2, these performance measures are grouped and averaged by geographic location of the corporate owners of the developing company. The data are based on a sample of 29 new car projects developed in the 1980s and 27 different new car projects in the 1990s. The results show that U.S. and European firms have made significant gains, catching up completely with the Japanese in lead time but still trailing in the total number of engineering hours required to develop a new vehicle. Ellison et al. also observe a continuing shift toward ""heavier"" project management systems, in which the functional and technical organizations have relatively less power in the matrix management structure than the car project team leaders. This practice was described in earlier work by Clark and Fujimoto as being significantly associated with superior performance.3 The use of suppliers in the development process, another practice associated with superior performance, has increased in the past decade. 2  U.S. and European firms have made significant gains, catching up completely with the Japanese in lead time but still trailing in the total number of engineering hours required to develop a new vehicle.  3  David J.

U.S. gains in performance result from fundamental changes in the way projects are managed, including more interdisciplinary participation by more closely linked development teams, greater and more effective use of information technology, and greater delegation of project responsibility by corporate management. Trends in the practices of the foreign competitors show an important part of the overall picture. Japanese trends show a strong emphasis on total product quality (e.g., launch of Acura, Lexus, Infiniti), perhaps at the expense of lead time and development productivity (total engineering hours per development project). However, in part because of the rise in the value of the yen, the pendulum between ""cost is no object"" quality and cost-effectiveness is rapidly swinging toward the latter. Nevertheless, the Japanese demonstrate a strong command of the link between product design and lean production. The European firms show lower rates of improvement at all levels, likely the result of a later and slower shift from traditional functional organization to project management. The Koreans have emerged as very competitive automakers in terms of lead time and development productivity, but lag significantly in quality.  Big 3 Assessment The current sales success of the U.S. industry exploits some temporary conditions (e.g., exchange rates, popularity of traditional product types, cyclical market upturn). It is not due solely to elimination of previous corporate weaknesses.  34  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The U.S. automobile industry has made significant operational improvements but still lags in mastery of the overall product development process. It is still not as adept at product development as certain competitors are, especially the Japanese (see corporate strategies and structures of the Big 3, discussed below). U.S. automakers should not rest on temporary success. The U.S. industry should avoid riding current good fortune and assuming that it will ensure continued success. Developing a robust product development infrastructure involves a number of initiatives: eliminating duplication in product development assets through reorganization, globalization, and alliances; developing platform and component set strategies across a portfolio of vehicle projects; defining critical areas of firm expertise and focus; creating strategic links to technology suppliers; and improving the way ""lessons learned"" are fed back into an interdisciplinary organization focused on new product development. Customer demand for high levels of product quality, safety, reliability, and sophistication, even in the most economical vehicle classes, poses a major challenge, particularly in an information climate that rapidly disseminates reports on good and bad product attributes. Implications of Vehicle Development Management Practices among the Big 3 There are enormous differences in how the Big 3 manage product development. Chrysler Corporation Chrysler's strategy emphasizes lean domestic product development featuring high integration with its suppliers and an increasing export focus. Chrysler has five platform teams that cover all U.S.-sourced products. All except Jeep and Truck are located in its new billion-dollar Chrysler Technical Center. Chrysler's U.S.-sourced product portfolio is limited to eight mass-production platforms. Its Diamond Star/Mitsubishi alliance is structured primarily to fill gaps in its model line. Chrysler produces exports to increase the utilization of U.S. plants and to build profits. The company has limited foreign production (minivans and Jeeps in Europe, Jeeps in China). Chrysler has a high level of component outsourcing (about 70 percent). Its suppliers are increasingly engineering large built-up assemblies, such as complete instrument clusters. There is also growing reuse of components across platforms (e.g., engines across Neon JA model platforms). Its The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 35  The current sales success of the U.S. industry exploits some temporary conditions. It is not due solely to elimination of previous corporate weaknesses.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  corporate structure incorporates a service function, platform teams, Tech Clubs, and a flattened organizational hierarchy. Chrysler's corporate staff functions as a service organization for platform teams, manufacturing, and shareholders by allocating resources, setting strategic goals, and managing infrastructure. It avoids interfering with platform teams. The platform teams take clear responsibility for vehicle development, subject to corporate-allocated budget and vehicle design intent. Interdisciplinary activity is high in engineering, marketing, finance, styling, and manufacturing. Supplier participation is coordinated with the total design effort. There is consensus management of tradeoffs. The Chrysler Technical Center supports start-to-finish platform development with modern test facilities. Chrysler's Tech Clubs--personnel working in the same system or component area (e.g., wiring, brakes, audio)--represent a ""virtual"" functional organization that maintains and disseminates technical knowledge across platform lines. Chrysler's flattened hierarchies have only five basic engineering grades (the original LH model project had one vice president, one general manager, five executive engineers, 25 managing engineers, and an engineering staff). Ford Motor Company Ford's global strategy, Ford 2000, has integrated global operations with global product alliances, segment management, and world-class timing. The Mondeo/Contour/Mystique ""World Cars"" are interlinked in Ford's Corporate Design network. Ford has a wide variety of alliances with Mazda (Escort and 323, Ranger and B2000, Explorer and Navajo), Nissan (Villager and Quest), Volkswagen (European Minivan), and Kia (Aspire), and there are corporate synergies with Jaguar and Aston-Martin. Ford's segment management divides each market by vehicle size and drive type and teams segment managers with vehicle program managers to identify and fill market niches from a joint business and technical perspective. Ford is proficient at low-cost, high-quality manufacturing. However, Ford's own extensive benchmarking against Toyota and Chrysler has indicated both higher product development cost and deficiencies in its time to market. Its world-class timing initiative seeks to standardize the vehicle development process and shorten time to production (43 months or less from Program Definition to Job #1 for single body-style programs; 48 months or less for multiple body-style programs).  Chrysler's corporate staff functions as a service organization for platform teams, manufacturing, and shareholders by allocating resources, setting strategic goals, and managing infrastructure.  Ford is proficient at low-cost, high-quality manufacturing.  36  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Ford's corporate structure comprises Automotive Operations, Vehicle Program Centers, and a balance of home organizations and dedicated teams. Ford Automotive Operations unites North American Automotive Operations and Ford of Europe, building on economies of scale from common systems such as the Ford Corporate Design network, its Worldwide Engineering Release System, and the Purchasing Release System. The rest of its operations are expected to follow in time. Ford's five Vehicle Program Centers in the United States and Europe divide development responsibility by vehicle size and drive type (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive) to supply global markets. Models are designed to carry high feature content to satisfy a variety of customer tastes. Ford is attempting to arrive at a balance of power between core engineering groups and dedicated program teams. It encourages both advanced systems and technologies as well as highly marketable vehicles. Ford consciously avoids the Chrysler platform team model because management feels it fails to leverage Ford's central technical strengths and support a broad, interlinked vehicle portfolio. General Motors Corporation The strategy of GM is multifold, maintaining a coherent product portfolio, ""Voice of the Customer"" research, a standardized four-phase development process, strategic links between its North American and international operations, and organizational revitalization. GM's North American Operations Car Platforms and Truck Platforms have replaced the former Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada, Buick-OldsmobileCadillac, and Truck and Bus groupings. GM's Platform rationalization is under way to support each brand's mission and achieve greater commonality of platforms and components. GM is aiming at unique variations on flexible engineering themes rather than a proliferation of unique systems (e.g., from 200 steering column designs in 1993 models to 50 in 19972000 models). GM has assigned a disciplined, mandatory application of a four-phase vehicle development process to all new products. GM is making an increased effort to listen to the ""Voice of the Customer"" through Needs Segmentation market research--designing future vehicles to fit groups of people desiring similar attributes rather than predetermined size- and price-based market segments. GM's intensive consumer research has included over a million interviews since 1986.  GM's intensive consumer research has included over a million interviews since 1986.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  37   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  GM's structure is a matrix organization, with a Vehicle Launch Center and Centers of Expertise. GM's North American new product development (NPD) organization is run by four ""heavyweight"" executives, one each for engineering and design operations (Small Car Group, Midsize & Large Car Group); truck platforms (Matrix of Marketing Divisions-- brands like Chevrolet and Pontiac); platform divisions; and vehicle groups (Small Car and Midsize & Large Car Groups). The Vehicle Launch Center (VLC) monitors the first two years of vehicle development process (program proposal, concept development, and technology application) as the initial home for each new dedicated platform team. It co-locates the team with centralized marketing, engineering, manufacturing, planning, and design staff resources. The VLC acts as storehouse of NPD knowledge and has enforced documentation and business management practices. GM's five North American Operations Technical Centers for design, engineering, manufacturing, research and development, and quality hold Centers of Expertise and support the Vehicle Launch Center with central staff experts and personnel loaned to platform teams. Development Organizations in the ""Design Cultures"" of the Big 3 Considered innovative, Chrysler Corporation's design culture is informal, direct, collaborative, and collegial. Design innovations are owned by the entire team and are taken up as challenges by engineering. At Chrysler, there is intense concentration of activities on a single project at a time with high group identification and few personality-driven product changes. The product design team maintains close working relationships between disciplines and with suppliers, has one-third union participants on the platform team, and maintains longer supplier relationships than the other companies in the Big 3. Ford's design culture may be described as academic and introspective, but it is also pragmatic, with its business and technical groups in beneficial give-and-take with one another. Individual Ford employees must develop networks across the company`s large and complex organization to effectively carry out their tasks. Ford spends more time than Chrysler at process and organizational introspection, perhaps a result of having a greater number of technical and business specialists not directly engaged in platform activities. Ford also supports substantially more infrastructure than Chrysler, but less than GM.  At Chrysler, there is intense concentration of activities on a single project at a time with high group identification and few personalitydriven product changes.  Ford's design culture may be described as academic and introspective, but it is also pragmatic, with its business and technical groups in beneficial give-and-take with one another. 38  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The culture of GM has, to some extent, been characterized by extended chains of command, a complex matrix organization, and competition for resources. GM is attempting to address these issues and to improve communication throughout its organization. As a result, there have been substantial increases in communication and teamwork between GM's marketing and technical staffs. Impacts of Cultural Organization and Product Development Strategies of the Big 3 The product development strategies of the Big 3 are the result of decades of corporate practice increasingly influenced by foreign competition and other external factors. The response of each of these companies is reflected in its corporate culture and performance. Each of the Big 3 defines its issues differently than the other two, and the implications of these definitions are similarly divergent. Chrysler Corporation Of the Big 3, Chrysler has the highest per-vehicle profits and lowest break-even point, allowing it to expand its product portfolio and manufacturing capacity despite lingering concerns over quality. Chrysler has less infrastructure than the other Big 3. Its vehicle mix is more skewed toward high-profit minivans, and its sport utility vehicles contribute to its high net per-vehicle profit. The Neon platform, two manufacturing plants, and a new stamping facility were developed in 31 months for approximately $1.3 billion (an improvement over the LH platform--Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision, Dodge Intrepid--for which one plant and a retooled stamping facility were developed in 39 months at a cost of $1.6 billion). Ford Motor Company Ford and GM have much broader vehicle portfolios than Chrysler. Ford's vehicle mix is less heavily weighted toward high-profit minivans and SUVs. Ford has performed well, with strong sales but poor net per-vehicle profit and high warranty costs in 1994. Its CDW-27 (Mondeo) World Car program was costly, and its introduction of the new minivan (Windstar) was quickly leapfrogged by Chrysler's completely revamped minivan line. Ford's organizational structure and corporate culture--for example, its history of vehicle champions--have slowed its efforts to create cohesive and dedicated program teams. However, Ford's management is aware of the need to make lines of decision-making more direct and quicker, and organizational changes are in process.  There have been substantial increases in communication and teamwork between GM's marketing and technical staffs.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  39   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  General Motors Corporation GM is attempting to be more responsive to the demands of the marketplace. Oldsmobile is furthest along in remaking itself in Saturn's image as a model of customer responsiveness. The Corsa model is a de facto World Car. The Saturn has been a cultural and sales success, although only a limited financial success. In terms of performance, GM has had the lowest net per-vehicle profits of the Big 3, with continued problems in its minivan and family car markets and problems increasing content from its outside suppliers. Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Geo are below average in J.D. Power's Vehicle Dependability Study on five-year quality. But GM quality has been steadily improving: Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile are in the top ten of the same study. Also, in some key segments (e.g., midsize car [Lumina] and small car [Citation]) it is very cost and value competitive compared with Ford's offerings (Taurus and Contour). GM's relationship with the United Auto Workers is still strained: strikes over management attempts to outsource brake system calipers cost GM significant production losses in 1996.  40  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  T  ECHNOLOGY  T  he automobile is a highly engineered, sophisticated product that meets stringent reliability, durability, and social requirements. Its design, manufacture, and operation call more and more for cutting-edge technology. The Big 3 companies have a long history of aggressively pursuing research and development (R&D) to stay competitive, to meet the changing needs of the consumer, and to meet federal requirements. The diverse ways in which the companies meet these technology needs reflect their diverse corporate competitive strategies.  General Motors Research has historically emphasized internal corporate research and is currently the top corporate investor in R&D in the United States, with a 1995 R&D budget of $8.4 billion--a 19 percent increase over 1994. It also employs more PhDs than any other private employer in the United States. While much of its work has been in central research laboratories, GM is placing much greater stress on the integration of its research efforts with the product planning of its car and truck divisions. The GM tech center in Warren, Michigan, reflects this change. 4 The center's R&D plans are more focused on the needs of its operating divisions and its customers; more speculative R&D has been reduced. The center is now organized as a business unit, with its research portfolio fully open to GM's product development community. The center's director has set a goal of placing 50 percent of projects into production in two to three years. Consideration is also being given to licensing GM inventions throughout the industry. To meet its R&D needs, Ford relies on the Ford Research laboratory, which employs over 650 full-time scientists and engineers. In general, the objective of the research staff is to provide long-range technical leadership to the corporation worldwide. This means the lab is involved in a spectrum of activities ranging from the development of advanced product and manufacturing technologies to long-range, relevant research in key scientific and engineering disciplines. The research staff maintains a mix of long-, medium-, and short-range programs. Short-range efforts generally have a goal of solving immediate or pressing production problems and account for about 10 percent of Ford's efforts. Mediumrange projects are directed toward specific goals to meet longer-term company needs and generally make up about 80 percent of Ford's efforts. Long-range programs are the least goal-directed efforts and make up the remaining 10 percent. Ford's research expenditures of $6.5 billion in 1995 4  The automobile is a highly engineered, sophisticated product that meets stringent reliability, durability, and social requirements.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  41   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  made it the second largest U.S. corporate supporter of R&D, following GM. Chrysler Corporation addresses the need for new technologies differently. Chrysler research and development efforts are split into two portions. Its Scientific Lab handles technical R&D and delivers technical expertise and services to the rest of Chrysler's platform groups. The second portion of its R&D effort is primarily handled by a small group known as ""Liberty and Technical Affairs"" and relates to advanced development efforts. This group addresses specific high-technology projects and develops ideas in the form of concept cars and government contract proposals. The two R&D groups work in concert to monitor emerging technologies, pursue new product concepts, and develop platformfocused products.  This historic public/ private partnership aims to strengthen U.S. global competitiveness, preserve American jobs, reduce our country`s dependence on foreign oil, and improve the environment.  Cooperative Research and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles Complementing their individual efforts, the Big 3 automakers have also placed increasing emphasis on research collaborations with one another, with their suppliers, and with the federal government. For example in 1992, Chrysler, Ford, and GM created the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) to facilitate, monitor, and promote precompetitive cooperative research. Through this cooperative effort, resources are coordinated more effectively to conduct research and evaluate alternative technologies to improve the automobile. Besides working with each other to research and develop technologies for the next generation of vehicles, the Big 3 automakers are working with the federal government in a cooperative, precompetitive research effort called the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Combining the technology resources of seven federal agencies, twenty government laboratories, and USCAR, this historic public/private partnership aims to strengthen U.S. global competitiveness, preserve American jobs, reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil, and improve the environment. At an early stage of the partnership, the participants recognized the importance of involving the traditional base of automotive suppliers as well as some nontraditional sources of supply. Since that time, a special effort has been devoted to understanding the supplier community, recognizing its importance as a source of technical innovation, and 42 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  finding means for its effective interaction with PNGV. Currently, more than 400 automotive suppliers and universities have joined in PNGV research. PNGV has three mutually supportive, interactive goals: 1. Significantly improve national competitiveness in manufacturing. 2. Implement commercially viable innovations from ongoing research in conventional vehicles. 3. Develop environmentally friendly vehicles that can achieve up to three times the fuel efficiency of comparable 1994 family sedans (i.e., the 1994 Chrysler Concorde, Ford Taurus, and Chevrolet Lumina) without sacrificing performance, safety, or affordability. Major technical improvements and innovations are needed to enable the U.S. auto industry to build this next generation of automobiles, which will operate with much higher energy efficiencies and safety levels and lower emissions than today's vehicles, while maintaining present performance, size, and utility standards. (See table 3, which lists some of the technical areas USCAR has identified as needing research and development.)  Table 3.

In working together toward national social and economic goals, this partnership is a unique departure from traditional approaches to achieving public policy objectives.  Increasing Use of Electronic Components With both vehicles and transportation infrastructure incorporating more electronics into their systems, the auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronics components and as a driver of electronic technology development. Like many other industries, the automobile industry is rapidly increasing its use of electronic components. Virtually every aspect of driving a modern high-end automobile is controlled by electronics-- acceleration, braking, seating, security, entertainment, navigation, driver information, crash protection, steering, etc. This trend is likely to continue. In addition, the automotive infrastructure--traffic control and guides, law enforcement, toll assessment, and the like--rely increasingly on electronic controls. As a result of both of these trends, the auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronic components and systems and as a driver of electronic technology development. Ford and GM, which are highly vertically integrated with electronics, are likely to benefit as the market value of their electronics divisions grows.  The auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronic components and systems and as a driver of electronic technology development.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  45   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ADOPTION AND EVOLUTION OF LEAN PRODUCTION HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTICES Human Resource Management  Labor-management relations, workplace innovations, and human resource practices play a pivotal role in the economic performance and competitiveness of the American auto industry.  L  abor-management relations, workplace innovations, and human resource practices play a pivotal role in the economic performance and competitiveness of the American auto industry and serve as a bellwether and pacesetter for American industry in general. This has been the case from Henry Ford's moving manufacturing line and $5-a-day wage, to the ""quality of working life"" programs in the 1970s, to the present efforts to implement lean production models of work organization, human resource, and labor-management practices. These issues are tightly intertwined with technology and manufacturing strategies and practices. Indeed, the joint effects of these human and technical factors determine manufacturing performance.  Key Issues in Labor Relations Demographics in the United Auto Workers Automotive employment (particularly in the Big 3) has been hit by three important forces: (1) the industry has reduced its capacity; (2) the industry has improved its productivity, requiring fewer workers to make the vehicles demanded; and (3) global competition in the automotive supplier sector has resulted in a reduction in unionization. It has also resulted in a higher wage differential between employees of the Big 3 and employees of the supplier sector, who earn less. As a result, over the past two decades, the United Auto Workers (UAW) membership has declined and aged considerably. Few workers have been hired into UAW jobs in the past two decades and many low-seniority UAW members have lost their jobs. Moreover, a significant fraction of the UAW membership (estimated at 30 to 50 percent by some) will retire in the next decade. This is expected to lead to significant additional hiring and outsourcing by the Big 3.  46  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Labor-Management Innovations in the U.S. Auto Industry To preserve high-wage auto manufacturing jobs in the United States, many believe the auto industry must further the adoption of labormanagement cooperation and workplace innovation, such as the Saturn and New United Motors Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) models and Chrysler's Modern Operating Agreements. Despite 20 years of significant Japanese competition in the auto industry, the penetration of cooperative labor relations is still low in the U.S. auto industry. Why is diffusion of workplace innovations slower than expected in the U.S. auto industry? There is no consensus answer to this question. However, IMVP research, along with findings of a recent U.S. government commission,5 suggests that the following factors are significant: 1. Limits on labor/management teams. American labor law restricts the forms of employee participation in non-union relationships and places limits on employee participation and workplace reforms in collective bargaining relationships.6 Union recognition. Support and diffusion are also limited by business and labor battles over the process of union recognition. The ability and willingness of employers to open and maintain non-union facilities and the frustrations experienced by workers and union when trying to unionize facilities in the face of strong managerial resistance continue to strain labor-management relations. These tensions make it difficult for union leaders to be unwavering champions of cooperation and innovation in relations with management. The cooperative relations and trust required to sustain workplace innovations within and across companies are not likely unless there is a de-escalation of labormanagement conflict in new plants and new union organizations. The full benefits of these workplace innovations will not be realized until these larger conflicts are reduced. Economic pressures. Economic pressures for downsizing, outsourcing, cost controls, and short-term performance compete  2.

The diffusion of human resource innovations is constrained by the fact that these innovations have clear, immediate costs but uncertain long-term payoffs and by the relative unimportance of human resource policy in the strategic decision-making of American corporations.  Implications of the Key Issues in Manufacturing Plants and Human Resource Practices Changing Labor-Management Relations, Workplace Innovations, and Human Resource Practices Lean production is a composite of practices. For example, it links manufacturing policies with human resource/labor-management practices. The combination of these manufacturing and human resource practices produces the highest levels of manufacturing performance (quality, productivity, flexibility) in plants around the world.7 Plants that invest heavily in automation and advanced technologies without changing their human resource practices perform poorly relative to those that take an integrated approach to technology and human resources. By 1990, Japanese-owned plants in Japan and the United States had implemented more integrated human resource and manufacturing systems than U.S.-owned plants, which, in turn, had implemented more of these practices than European plants. In 1990, as today, there was wide variance in U.S. practices. Many plants were still characterized by traditional labor-management and human resource management systems. The unionized transplants, such as NUMMI, had gone far in implementing lean production and labormanagement systems jointly in a unionized environment. Some nonunion Japanese plants had also implemented many of these features. Saturn, a new GM division, had implemented a unique co-management system jointly with the UAW. From 1989 to 1994, U.S. plants continued to progress in adopting lean production practices and the associated labor-management and human resource practices. The latter practices have not moved as rapidly as in European plants, but the European plants had farther to go in achieving  The combination of these manufacturing and human resource practices produces the highest levels of manufacturing performance (quality, productivity, flexibility) in plants around the world.  7  James P. Womack, Daniel T.

The performance gap between Japanese-owned plants in Japan and in the United States and U.S.-owned plants has narrowed but remains significant. Finally, the variance of performance within regions is often as great or greater than the variance between regions. Specifically, the survey data suggest the following: 1. Inventory has been reduced considerably in U.S. and European plants and in Japanese North American transplants. In the United States, inventory reductions have been achieved more through reductions in supplier stocks than from internal plant buffers. U.S. plants have increased their use of teams, job rotation, and suggestion systems. However, the diffusion of these practices among Big 3 U.S. plants is proceeding at a much slower pace than in Europe. Japanese plants in Japan and in the United States continue to lead the world in the adoption of these human resource practices. There is modest increase in the diffusion of human resource practices such as contingent compensation, investment in training, and reduction in status differences in the United States, rapid growth in Europe (and in Australia), and continued use of these practices in Japanese plants in Japan and the United States.  2.  3.  U.S. plants have increased their use of teams, job rotation, and suggestion systems.  These overall trends mask considerable variation across companies and individual facilities in the United States. Ford, for example, has followed a cautious, steady incremental change process that has built on its experiences in joint ventures with Mazda (in the United States and abroad). It has made less use of teams than GM or Chrysler but focused more heavily on use of various total quality management tools and methods (e.g., statistical process control). Chrysler has a number of traditionally structured plants and a half dozen Modern Operating Agreement (MOA) plants in which the full range of lean production human resource practices are implemented for all workers through a joint union-management oversight and governance process. Chrysler also has several plants where many of these features are implemented without the full union-management governance process (Progressive Operating Agreement plants). Some case studies suggest that Chrysler MOA plants benefit significantly from this arrangement relative to its non-MOA plants.8  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  49   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  GM probably has the widest variation in experiences and practices. Considering the Saturn Corporation experiment and the NUMMI facility (owned jointly with Toyota), GM and the UAW have gone farthest among the Big 3 in experimenting with very different models of labor-management relations. Saturn, for example, has co-management structures and processes throughout the organization--from the shop floor to the strategic advisory committee that serves as Saturn's link to the GM parent, and across functional areas--from human resources to sales, marketing, and supplier relations. Yet GM also has many traditional plants and a large number of hybrid facilities that contain elements of both traditional and lean production manufacturing and work practices. Even given this wide variation, the U.S. auto industry is farther along than many industries in the United States in introducing and diffusing workplace innovations. In Saturn, NUMMI, Chrysler's MOA plants, and certain other facilities, the auto industry also has some of the most visible models of transformed union-management relations that serve as benchmarks for other industries. At the same time, the auto industry continues to have many rather traditional or only partially modified union-management relations and collective bargaining activities, as well as a growing non-union foreign transplant segment.  Overall, the United States has experienced a significant expansion in employee participation and associated workplace innovations over the past 20 years.  This diversity mirrors the diversity of practices and the mixed levels of support for workplace innovations among management and leaders throughout American industry. Overall, the United States has experienced a significant expansion in employee participation and associated workplace innovations over the past 20 years. In the past decade, the labor movement has become more willing to support these innovations and has recently endorsed the principles of workplace innovation and labor-management partnerships. Yet, despite the growing support for workplace innovations, our best estimates indicate that only one-fifth to one-third of American workplaces are engaged in significant employee participation or related forms of workplace innovation.9 Other Issues in Human Resource Practices In the mid-1980s, the UAW national leaders were advocates for new joint governance and more team-oriented approaches to plant relations. In the 1990s, however, they have been less committed to the approaches found 8  9  Malcolm Lovall, Susan Goldberg, Larry Hunter, Thomas A.

Thomas Kochan and Paul Osterman, (1994).  50  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  at NUMMI, Saturn, and other plants. This fact is best illustrated by the series of plant-level strikes at several GM plants over issues such as contracting out, staffing levels, production standards, and related local issues. Thus, the future rate of diffusion of these workplace innovations remains uncertain. Another important development in the U.S. auto industry in the 1980s and 1990s is the emergence of a significant and quite successful set of non-union transplant assembly plants. The only foreign-owned assembly plants that are unionized in the United States are joint ventures between GM, Chrysler, or Ford and a Japanese company. Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are operating their wholly-owned, non-union assembly plants in the United States. Toyota did so even after experiencing a high level of success in its NUMMI joint venture with GM and the UAW. Mercedes Benz and BMW are currently opening non-union assembly plants in the United States. Moreover, a large number of new foreign- and domestic-owned auto parts suppliers have opened plants in the United States in the past 15 years and kept them operating on a non-union basis. Thus, while the Big 3 (Saturn at GM, several renovated or newly opened plants at Chrysler, and selected Ford plants) have moved to governance systems that expand the role of the union, a significant portion of the industry is moving away from unionism altogether. This trend adds more diversity to the industry and a good deal of frustration and bitterness on the part of the UAW.  Moreover, a large number of new foreign- and domestic-owned auto parts suppliers have opened plants in the United States in the past 15 years and kept them operating on a non-union basis.  Experimentation Case Studies Twice in this century, the automotive industry has served as birthplace and proving grounds for fundamental innovations in the organization and execution of production. At the opening of the century, Henry Ford, the architect of the mass-production system, sifted through scores of ideas and performed thousands of experiments in the 20-year process of developing his system of production. Roughly a half century later, Taiichi Ohno, over a period of approximately 17 years (1948 to 1965), followed a similar path of constant experimentation, discovery, and innovation in developing the Toyota Production System. This tradition of constant experimentation in the search for improvements continues today in the auto industry--at the level of individual processes as well as at the level of the system of production.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  51   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Experimentation is the lifeblood of a healthy industry.  Such experimentation is the lifeblood of a healthy industry. Conversely, maintaining a stable system in a dynamic industry is almost a sure recipe for disaster. Few enterprises can expect shelter from Schumpeter's ""winds of creative destruction"" in today's world of increasingly open borders and tightly linked international economies. Organizations must experiment and grow to survive. Given this mandate for learning, most automotive companies today are actively exploring possibilities for improvement. In this section, we mention a few of the more visible experiments of the past decade. General Motors Seeks New Paths No company in the world mastered Henry Ford's system of mass production the way Ford's crosstown rival did. GM leapt ahead of Ford in the 1930s and raced to become the world's largest industrial concern. However, by the 1970s, as it sat on top of the world, GM had become frozen in the paradigm it mastered. The path to renewal has been slow and arduous. A number of GM plants have been very innovative in taking up the corporation's search for improvement in a world that has changed so dramatically since the early 1970s. Among these are the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, a joint venture between GM and Toyota; the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; GM Europe's Opel plant in Eisenach, Germany; and the CAM-I plant in Canada. NUMMI GM's manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, closed its doors in 1982 because of poor quality, low productivity, and dismal labor relations. Two years later, the plant re-opened as the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., under joint ownership of Toyota Motor Corporation and GM, using new management and labor policies but 80 percent of the UAW members who had worked there previously. IMVP researcher John Krafcik10 studied the before-and-after of the Fremont plant and discovered that, with Japanese lean methods, the new NUMMI plant doubled the productivity of the old plant, cut worker absenteeism by 90 percent, and cut the rework area in half with the installation of the ""pull cord"" system (in which workers on the assembly line pull the cord when a defect is detected, halting the system and allowing mass-produced errors to be eliminated). A low-tech operation, the NUMMI plant proved that a 10  John F. Krafcik, Learning from NUMMI (Cambridge, Mass.: IMVP and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1986).  52  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  plant did not have to be on Japanese soil with Japanese workers in order to be lean and successful. The plant demolished many myths about the nontransferability of lean production to the United States and to American workers. Saturn Also in the mid-1980s, GM's decision to create a ""different kind of a car company"" from the ground up resulted in the Saturn Corporation. The Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, provides a case study of a close labor-management partnership on the factory floor. Saturn has also created a unique partnership among the company, its dealers, and the car-buying public. Saturn leapt to the upper echelons of the closely watched J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys (recently rated third behind Lexus and Infiniti) and sets the standard for other dealerships on many dimensions. On the labor relations side, Saturn is a highly visible experiment with a new model of labor-management relations and organizational governance--one that challenges and departs from many of the customs, legal doctrines, and adversarial patterns of traditional U.S. industrial relations. Both the workers and the management at Saturn agreed from the start that they would distance themselves from the bureaucracies of GM and the UAW. It was an alliance between workers and management that has been pathbreaking in U.S. labor relations. The GM employee contract is seven inches thick, but Saturn's labor contract or ""Memo of Understanding"" is a scant 28 pages, covering everything including how the plant is managed. The agreement eliminated a number of sacred cows, such as the right to strike during the term of contract. Eisenach GM Europe's Opel plant at Eisenach is an example of a European enterprise embracing the principles of lean production.11 In 1989 the Eisenach plant, located in the then-moribund German Democratic Republic, was a morass of inefficiency producing an obsolete vehicle called the Trabant. GM purchased the Eisenach plant and brought in the best of lean expertise through the Kaizen Institute of Europe, a Japanese-based institute that teaches the values and methodology of lean enterprise. A new manufacturing plant was built in 199192, and intensive worker training introduced lean manufacturing methods. Problems were solved along the way, and lean principles were learned, built up, and implemented. The new plant is 11  With Japanese lean methods, the new NUMMI plant doubled the productivity of the old plant, cut worker absenteeism by 90 percent, and cut the rework area in half with the installation of the ""pull cord"" system.  Saturn has also created a unique partnership among the company, its dealers, and the car-buying public.  See discussion of Eisenach GM plant in Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White, Comeback: The Fall and Rise of the American Automobile Industry (New York, 1994).  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  53   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  already competitive with Japanese companies, is a vanguard plant for Opel and the rest of the European auto industry, and is on an upward curve of efficiency and quality. Toyota Tinkers with Success Toyota Motor Kyushu As the present decade opened, one of the biggest concerns among the major Japanese auto companies was that they would run out of labor to staff their factories in Japan, which seemed to face limitless demand for their automobiles. In 1993, two million Japanese 18-year-old males--the primary raw material for Japan's auto factories--entered the workforce. In 2010, only 1.2 million 18-year-old males will enter the workforce--a 40 percent drop. In 1990, just before Japan's ""bubble economy"" burst, the auto industry got a taste of what a labor shortage might be like. With much new found affluence and the growth of the financial and other service sectors, young Japanese began voting with their feet--against working in auto plants. The industry discovered that, despite the famed worker involvement through the kaizen process, car making, even in the highly touted lean production system, was, at its core, strenuous and unpleasant work. Some concluded that the greatest threat to the Japanese auto industry was the coming labor crunch. One solution to such a labor crunch would be to import more labor or cars into Japan to make up for any impending shortfall. (For example, Toyota has planned to import a small number of U.S.-made Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunbirds.) Another strategic option would be to reduce the labor content in automobiles through greater automation. A third would be to make automobile manufacturing jobs more attractive to Japanese citizens, competing more effectively on the labor market and shifting the labor shortfall to some other sector. The latter strategy is closely associated with the ""humanization"" movement, whose roots are primarily European. The movement was epitomized by the Uddevalla plant and its craft production environment with hours-long work cycles for many laborers rather than the repetitive 60-second cycle common in Japanese plants. Toyota attempted to address the anticipated labor shortfall using both greater automation and by making the jobs more labor-friendly. Toyota launched a new manufacturing company inside Japan--Toyota Motor Kyushu--and endowed it with new, automated, state-of-the-art, workerfriendly technology.12 Built at a cost of $1.5 billion and in continuous operation since 1992, the plant does stamping, body assembly, painting, and final assembly, in addition to making bumpers, instrument panels, 54 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  As the present decade opened, one of the biggest concerns among the major Japanese auto companies was that they would run out of labor to staff their factories in Japan.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  and suspension systems. Subsequently, due to an increase in the value of the yen and a stubbornly stagnant Japanese economy, the domestic labor shortage has turned to a surplus, perhaps reducing the strategic value of this plant. Toyota Motor Motomachi The Toyota Motomachi plant uses a different style of human resource practices in the assembly of the new four-wheel drive RAV4.13 Innovations include noise control, ergonomic interior design, and minimal use of robotics. The assembly line has a conventional overhead conveyor but is subdivided into five parts with buffer zones in between, relieving considerable stress on the workers. Automation has been cut back by two-thirds and is used only on rolling devices that move engines and gearboxes into position for human assembly. Toyota's rationale for reducing automation came from its own studies, which revealed that automation had reduced the number of line workers but had increased maintenance personnel. Producing 428 cars a day, the Motomachi plant may well have set a new benchmark for productivity, with a reported ten man-hours per vehicle. Though the success of the plant is attributable to Toyota management skills, some key ideas have been adopted from U.S. competitors, particularly Chrysler and Ford, which have also been reducing the number of parts in new models through value engineering techniques. Toyota plans to have each new model built with 70 percent of the parts common to earlier models. This plan has already saved Toyota nearly a half billion dollars. Supplier involvement in the design and engineering of full subassemblies has contributed considerable savings to Toyota, and more savings are expected in coming years. These examples, selected from two of the largest automobile companies, are but the tip of an enormous iceberg of experimentation in the industry. Every auto company in the world--large and small--is striving to find competitive advantage through innovations in products, technology, and systems management.  Toyota's rationale for reducing automation came from its own studies, which revealed that automation had reduced the number of line workers but had spawned a whole new generation of maintenance personnel.  12  13  C.H.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  55   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS S Supply Chain Policies  UPPLY  C  HAINS  T  he world's automotive manufacturing sector consists primarily of about 20 very large multinational corporations. The automotive supply sector, however, comprises thousands of firms ranging in size from a few employees to more than 100,000. Drawing conclusions about such a large and diverse sector is much more difficult than for the manufacturing sector.  Best practice in automotive supply chain management involves close, trusting relationships with long-standing suppliers that are intimately involved with the development and production of the components and subsystems they provide. The work of Kim Clark and Takahiro Fujimoto14 sheds much light on how outsourcing product development activities through ""black box parts"" reduces overall project lead time and engineering resources required for product development. In the past five years, Chrysler has aggressively incorporated those findings into its modus operandi, GM has largely rejected that philosophy, and Ford has settled somewhere in between. On the surface, the advice to improve partnerships along the supply chain, drawn largely from Japanese practices, seems to have significantly helped Chrysler on its return to growth and profitability. At the same time, GM insists on exerting extreme price pressure on its suppliers and aggressively negotiating division of the returns to innovations in supplied parts and subsystems. Some believe that this posture was responsible for the company's slow recovery from the recession of the early 1990s. However, GM estimates savings of $4 billion per year from this approach. GM is relying on its strong technical capabilities and its ability to bargain suppliers down on price to achieve its cost reductions. Chrysler, on the other hand, is encouraging its supplier-partners to find more ways to cut costs through cooperation and incentives to split gains.  Best practice in automotive supply chain management involves close, trusting relationships with longstanding suppliers that are intimately involved with development as well as production of the components and subsystems they provide.  14  Kim Clark and Takahiro Fujimoto, Product Development Performance (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1991).

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  57   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  In Japan, the rise of the yen has driven significant amounts of automotive assembly off the islands, delivering a quadruple shock to the Japanese supply base. First, domestic demand for Japanese-made parts is declining due to the decline in domestically assembled vehicles. Second, Japanese manufacturing plants are looking offshore to import cheaper parts (and in some cases severing those long-term partnerships). Third, demand from non-Japanese manufacturing plants is declining due to the increasing cost disadvantage of Japanese domestically produced parts. Fourth, competitors of Japanese suppliers (in North America, for example) are growing stronger as they hone their lean production skills by supplying the growing demand for North American-made parts from the Japanese transplant production. Conversely, North American automotive suppliers are enjoying a quadruple bonanza thanks to the same four phenomena: (1) rising North American production volumes, (2) growing opportunities to export to Japan, (3) reduced competition from Japanese-based (yen-dominated) suppliers, and (4) increased rate of learning from Japanese transplant customers. For the near future, U.S. automotive suppliers should continue to reap gains as long as they continue to improve and the yen does not lose significant value against the dollar.  Key Issues in Supply Chain Relationships Arm's Length vs. Partnership in Supplier Relations We discuss here two kinds of supplier-assembler relations. The first is a short-term, arm's-length relationship with minimal flow of information between supplier and assembler. This type of contractual relationship has traditionally characterized most supplier-assembler relations in the massproduction system, particularly in the United States. One of the features of 1980s lean production is a relatively long-term relationship between assembler and supplier, characterized by a rich flow of information between the two. These partnership relationships, the second type of supplier relation, tend to continue indefinitely or carry the implicit promise of renewal at the end of a specified contract. The partnership relationship is exemplified in the Japanese-style multifirm organizations called keiretsu. When supplier responsibility for product development and investment is not an issue, the arm's-length relationship is often sufficient and partnership relations would be superfluous. Furthermore, while Japanese-style partnerships have economic benefits, they are costly to set up and maintain and may reduce a customer's ability to switch away from inefficient suppliers. But when the supplier's responsibility includes involvement in 58 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  One of the features of 1980s lean production is a relatively long-term relationship between assembler and supplier, characterized by a rich flow of information between the two.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  the development of new or altered parts, Japanese-style partnerships become increasingly advantageous to both parties and tend to result in superior performance all around. Partnering firms (1) share more information and are better at coordinating interdependent tasks; (2) invest in relation-specific site, human, and physical assets that lower inventories, improve quality, and speed product development; and (3) rely on trust to govern the relationship, which is a highly efficient governance mechanism that minimizes transaction costs for both parties. 15 The Challenge of Moving from Arm's Length to Partnership Assembler-supplier partnerships are important vehicles for speeding product development, sharing risks and resources, and accessing technology and knowledge.16 Though U.S. firms have moved toward adopting keiretsu-style partnerships, the process has often been slow due to entrenched attitudes and long-standing suspicion between suppliers and assemblers from decades of competitive bidding and short, arm's-length contracts. But there are deeper economic and social factors that increase the resistance to supplier-assembler partnering in the U.S. auto industry. The Japanese community-oriented culture inherently fosters more goodwill among firms than the American culture of ""rugged individualism"" and social heterogeneity. These cultural differences may explain why partnering between companies is taking time to become established in the United States. Many U.S. firms have now acknowledged that the Japanese system has a number of advantages over arm's-length relationships in automotive supply chains. Whether U.S. industry will widely embrace these practices or develop hybrids of Japanese and U.S. strategies to achieve tighter and more productive supplier-assembler relationships remains to be seen. However, the case of Chrysler, discussed later in this section, offers strong evidence that American firms can successfully and profitably implement the partnership model.  Many U.S. firms have now acknowledged that the Japanese system has a number of advantages over arm's-length relationships in automotive supply chains.  15  16  Susan Helper, ""Supplier Relations and Investment in Automation: Results of Survey Research in the U.S. Auto Industry,"" Sept. 1991; Sako, 1992; Dyer, forthcoming.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  59   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Slow Adoption of Innovative Human Resource Practices among U.S. Suppliers As with the adoption of partnership relations with customers, the record with respect to adoption of partnership with employees is mixed. On the positive side, 92 percent of supplier plants had quality circles, and on average, 56 percent of those firms' employees had attended a meeting in the six months before the survey was mailed in summer 1993. On the other hand, 38 percent of the plant managers who responded to the survey said they did not know (even within 10 percent) how many suggestions workers had made in the past year. Those who did know said half of the suggestions had been implemented on average.17 Slow Adoption of Innovative Practices with Second-Tier Suppliers Supplier relations with second-tier suppliers are sluggish and well behind the lean advances being made in supplier-assembler relations. Only about one-third of U.S. suppliers offer multiyear contracts or technical assistance to a majority of their own suppliers. Moreover, only 40 percent have a majority of suppliers who participate in product design or produce just-in-time.  Supply Chain Management Future Directions for Big 3 Supply Chains Only 29 percent of U.S. suppliers had relationships with their most important customer that could be classified as partnership relationships.18 GM has actively moved away from partnership relationships with its suppliers. The average length of contracts GM offers has fallen about 40 percent, from 1.8 years in 1989 to just over one year in 1993. GM also has set up a system of worldwide competitive bidding, saving an estimated $4 billion per year in the prices it paid for parts between 1992 and 1994. Despite the advantages to GM, some suppliers say they will refuse to supply new technology to GM due to its policy requiring quotes from prospective suppliers and complete technical information on the product and its manufacture, free of any claims of confidentiality.19 Such 17  18  Susan R.

Sloan Management Review, Spring 1995.  60  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  a one-way partnership relationship is unpalatable to some suppliers. GM officials acknowledge that this policy means that GM will have to continue doing most of its product development in-house in order to ensure apples-to-apples comparisons among supplier bids. This strategy could result in GM's losing the advantages of supplier participation in product development. On the other hand, the U.S. auto industry has made some significant strides toward partnership relationships since 1989, even taking into account the GM experience. For example, 80 percent of U.S. suppliers now provide their customers with detailed information on the steps they use in their production process--up from 50 percent in 1989. These new U.S. figures are equal to the percentages in Japan's supplier-assembler partnership relationships. The information suppliers provide is crucial to the adoption of techniques such as value analysis/value engineering, in which the production process is streamlined to eliminate waste. Similarly, the participation of U.S. suppliers in product design now matches the Japanese. U.S. suppliers now far outpace the Japanese in the percentage of the sales that come from products not produced five years ago: United States, 20 percent; Japan, 5 percent.20 Chrysler continues to devolve responsibility onto its suppliers. For example, TRW is working to integrate the passenger-side air bag into the instrument panel designed with another supplier, even though it means that TRW will no longer deal directly with the automaker on this product. However, most parts are still not provided in particularly large systems, meaning that the manufacturing plant must accommodate a great deal of complexity. The median supplier to the Big 3 assembles only four parts to make the component it supplies to the automaker; in contrast, the median Japanese-owned supplier to a Japanese assembler located in the United States assembles 12 parts.21 Several of the Japanese-owned assemblers (Honda and Toyota in particular) have established intensive technical assistance programs for their U.S.-based suppliers. For example, in Honda's BP program, a team including Honda technicians, supplier managers, and supplier workers studies one process for several months and makes suggestions to im-  On the other hand, the U.S. auto industry has made some significant strides toward partnership relationships since 1989.

This process has led to 30 to 40 percent improvements in quality and productivity in that area for each of the few dozen suppliers that have tried it.22  Chrysler Corporation has significantly restructured its outsourcing through a streamlined and geographically more accessible system of third-party logistics services.  Case Study: Chrysler's Supplier Logistics Chrysler Corporation has significantly restructured its outsourcing through a streamlined and geographically more accessible system of third-party logistics services.23 In all, Chrysler has considerably reduced the number of logistic providers. For example, the number of truckload suppliers has been reduced from 250 to 30, coordinated by only one lead truckload provider. The number of less-than-truckload suppliers has been reduced from 25 to just one. Chrysler has 2,600 suppliers shipping a total of 34,000 parts from 3,300 locations. The corporation has 38 facilities, three logistics centers, and 15 manufacturing plants. At both its Belvidere and Sterling Heights manufacturing plants, Chrysler has reduced the number of locations of supplier shipment points by around 40 percent and has significantly reduced the average distance from supplier point to manufacturing. Chrysler's plant in Bramalea, Ontario, offers an insight into creative utilization of existing facilities. Because it is manufacturing beyond its original capacity, the Bramalea plant is outsourcing more than most auto plants, integrating direct supplier sourcing (40 percent of volume) with flow-through warehousing (45 percent of volume) and a sequence center (15 percent of volume).

However, in the past several decades, the pressures on the industry to make its factories and product development processes more efficient have spilled over into the distribution and retailing (postmanufacturing) sectors--cutting profit margins and causing significant restructuring in the distribution and retail industry base. This restructuring, although quite significant, has attracted much less attention than the manufacturing sector's changes because it involves no dramatic dislocation of people, jobs, or economic base. These downstream segments of the supply chain are experiencing a shift from being capital intensive (focused on inventory investment) and people intensive (sales forces) to being more information intensive (having the right vehicle in the right place at the right time). Due to greater flexibility of labor and capital in the postmanufacturing markets, this conversion from physical logistics to information logistics is shifting the power and leverage in the supply chain toward economic agents that are highly entrepreneurial and flexible. These economic forces have reduced the number of dealers in the United States (now approximately 22,000) and are expected to continue doing so. More important than the absolute dealer count is the trend toward segmentation of the many industries that make up distribution. Preliminary research reveals early development of a number of new business structures and methods. Following are brief discussions of key trends emerging in this diverse industrial segment.  Due to greater flexibility of labor and capital in the postmanufacturing markets, this conversion from physical logistics to information logistics is shifting the power and leverage in the supply chain toward economic agents that are highly entrepreneurial and flexible.  Key Issues in Distribution, Retailing, and Postmanufacturing Unlike the small group of relatively tightly organized supply chains, the postmanufacturing sector is a much looser collection of organizations that are not so centrally focused around the automaker. Since most of these organizations are driven directly by customer behavior rather than assembly scheduling, their activities are constantly shifting and  24  This section is based on the research of Martin Anderson, Associate Director, IMVP.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  63   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  appear to be far more random than activities organized in the production portion of the value chain. Industrial performance in the postmanufacturing sector is determined by a set of loose linkages, constantly negotiated among a wide variety of independent companies, including automakers, parts suppliers, dealers, transportation companies, information services companies, advertising and marketing organizations, consumer groups, fleet owners, vehicle auctions, financial providers, and independent service and repair organizations. Since much of the control of this portion of the value chain occurs within the jurisdiction of state laws, local policy issues are often far more important at this end. If an automaker wants to improve its premanufacturing efficiency, it can focus suppliers on relatively homogenous performance measures throughout the linked production chain, such as manufacturing hours per vehicle or quality targets. If an automaker wants to improve its postmanufacturing inventory management, however, it faces a much more complex array of players and relatively few homogenous measures of performance. IMVP site interviews show that interdealer transfers (cars shipped between dealers to match local demand patterns) can range from as low as 5 percent to as high as 50 percent of sales within a single brand, depending on the dealer and the region. This finding indicates that both dealer and region can represent significant factors for profitable and efficient distribution.  A central issue is now emerging in automotive distribution--how to create incentives and commercial relationships among a number of players with different agendas in order to meet new competitive mandates for improved distribution performance.  Dealers within a single brand may create dramatically different positions with their customers. Some may adopt a Saturn-like ""no haggle"" posture; others may openly publicize the fact that they negotiate prices. There are high performers and low performers in all of these categories. Early research shows that diversity proliferates in this system that many have considered to be uniform. Thus, improving the distribution system will be quite different from improving the factories in the supply chain. Inventory control--a strategic pillar of distribution--requires orchestrating the behavior of car salespeople, dealer-owners, market data companies, transport companies, national and local advertising and promotion channels (television, radio, print, on-line), capital suppliers, and others. None of these players are owned by the automaker, and many are not contracted directly to the auto company. A central issue is now emerging in automotive distribution--how to create incentives and commercial relationships among a number of 64 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  players with different agendas in order to meet new competitive mandates for improved distribution performance. The principal U.S. auto industry challenges of the past 15 years were (1) to reduce the quantity of work required to make a car, (2) to reduce the defects in each car, (3) to reduce the resources required to develop a new car and bring it to market, and (4) to reduce the overhead of running the supply and manufacturing system. The massive response to these challenges has stemmed the growth rate in production costs by reducing waste in each factory and by better coordinating relations between factories in the supply chain. Now, at a time of growing global competition, the next challenge is to reduce wasted effort and cost in distribution. Given the relative diffusion of organizations in the postmanufacturing sector, this new challenge raises a number of related issues: n n  How to better capture and process customer requirements How to better link rapidly changing customer requirements to a comparatively less flexible production system How to better match specific vehicles to customer requirements How to speed delivery after the purchase agreement is concluded How factories and automotive manufacturing companies can best cope with rapidly diversifying types of retail and distribution channels How manufacturers might best relate to the growing number of multibrand retailers What major strategic changes will occur in the core franchise system, given the potential created by new information technologies The implications of global changes in postmanufacturing practices  n n n  n  n  n  Automotive marketing, distribution, and retailing represent approximately 20 to 30 percent of the value of a new car.

Almost one-third of this value is directly created by retailing of new and used vehicles, service and repair, and related postmanufacturing activity. Perhaps more important, many of the keys for a successful manufacturing company are held by players in the postmanufacturing sectors. Retailers, customer researchers, forecasters, distributors, financial sources, and others define what the manufacturing sector should make and how and when it should make it, because they have direct contact with the wishes of the ultimate customer. Manufacturing organizations that do not heed the information embedded in the complex postmanufacturing networks suffer poor sales, high inventories, and tarnished reputations with customers. In the past, with less competitive markets, auto companies could afford the often hidden costs of high retail inventories. Now, all manufacturers must find new ways to limit these costs by understanding customer needs and by listening carefully through the various layers of retailing and distribution.  Making Distribution Lean Factories are beginning to address the problems of sluggish auto distribution pipelines. Having learned the lessons of just-in-time inventory in manufacturing, virtually every car company is trying to extend such streamlining into the distribution and retail portion of the value chain. With tens of billions of dollars tied up in slow-moving inventory, the potential payoff has become clear. The challenge is to coordinate the diverse collection of organizations to collectively recapture some of that cost. The most common innovation is to change the structure of field inventory to more closely align the slower, less flexible factory manufacturing schedule with the rapid changes in customer demand, while simultaneously reducing total field inventory. Rover and other European companies have been innovative with various forms of stock pooling and order processing. Most American-based factories are launching similar efforts. Perhaps most widely publicized are the Cadillac experiments that pool all the Cadillac inventory in a region (e.g., Florida) for availability to any dealer in the region. The central thrust of these efforts is to allow individual vehicles to remain unclaimed until the ""sales moment,"" to allow them to ""float"" flexibly through the stocking system. Doing so can dramatically increase the likelihood that an individual vehicle will reach an exact match buyer. In the traditional system, production units are usually locked into a specific 66 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  delivery path before or shortly after manufacturing, and they queue up in field inventory or sell at a discount (or both) because they are not precisely matched to a specific buyer. Most observers expect major innovations in physical inventory distribution and the supporting information infrastructure during the next five years. Some companies clearly envision a form of ""produce to order"" in the car business within 10 years.  The Role of Information Technology in Selling Cars As in all of retailing, the information technology revolution portends dramatic change in the automotive industry. Electronic data systems provide the mechanism for much of the new and used car supply industry. Increasing information systems and controls have kept dealers in business as margins have become very thin. Major advances in technology will allow better matching of factory production and changing consumer tastes, resulting in leaner distribution patterns. The postmanufacturing businesses are beginning to show a huge appetite for new electronic services, and it is reasonable to expect that this growth will fuel corresponding growth in the computer and electronics sector. Given the potential of new information technology systems demonstrated by both the factories and advanced dealers, the auto retailing sector seems destined to become a significant electronic systems market during the next ten years. Information technology for the postmanufacturing business falls into the following categories: n n  Most observers expect major innovations in physical inventory distribution and the supporting information infrastructure during the next five years. Some companies clearly envision a form of ""produce to order"" in the car business within 10 years.  Technologies that enhance the existing business structure ""Spec-ing"" systems that allow salespeople to match factory options to customer needs more accurately and to create a more accurate demand forecast In-house training and service management systems that connect factory engineering expertise to all technicians in a within-brand dealership Customer outreach systems linked to factory-sponsored advertising and marketing Technologies that will accelerate current trends toward nontraditional distribution structures The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 67  n  n  n   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  n  Customer relation systems (via the Internet or similar customeroriented media) that allow brokers or order takers to become viable economic organizations (reducing significantly the role of traditional dealerships in many transactions) Analogs to shop-by-phone or catalog channels Retail systems that allow mega-dealers to solidify their multibrand positions (similar to the systems that support mega-retailers like Wal-Mart)  n n  Auto retailing can adopt many dimensions of the mail-order or direct-sell computer business.  An automobile is such a major purchase for most people that it will always require some form of physical retailing by dealers. However, auto retailing can adopt many dimensions of the mail-order or direct-sell computer business. A consumer information industry has already arisen in the auto sector over the past three decades. Now any customer can find the information needed to negotiate the purchase of a new or used car without visiting a dealer or using any factorysponsored information. This freedom allows customers to shop independently before going to a dealer. There are many more window-shoppers for cars than there are buyers, although these window-shoppers do represent future buyers. Increasing numbers of customers are window-shopping through information sources, many of which are being rapidly converted to the electronic media. Through on-line services, the Internet, toll-free numbers, and cable television, shoppers now have enhanced opportunities early in their decision cycle to find information and be guided to the choice of an appropriate vehicle, comfortably in advance of the time they actually make their purchase. In short, there are now many more ways to retail cars than setting up a street corner dealership, running television commercials, and hoping someone comes in to buy a car currently on the lot. Now buyers can be identified well in advance, and their shopping experience can be tailored to their personal buying style and timing. The implications are considerable for the rest of the automotive industry in terms of forecasting, production scheduling, inventory and financial control, and even product planning.  Independence and Diversification of North American Dealerships Much postmanufacturing activity, especially in North America, is not controlled by the automakers. Industry players in distribution and 68 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  retailing often act quite independently from the factory as they market automobiles. Moreover, distributors and retailers often work with more than one car manufacturer at the same time. Although dealerships carry factory brands, the dealer may not be as dependent on the factory as an automotive component supplier is; a distribution organization can potentially source its products globally--from any auto producer in the world. A unique, often confusing, characteristic of the retail sector in North America is the delicate balance of power between factory and dealer created by a network of state laws and the franchise contract. The dealer needs a franchise contract from the manufacturer to sell that manufacturer's cars. The manufacturer's control is not insignificant: Along with the franchise requirement, the factory can control the location and style of prospective dealerships. However, in most states the dealers enjoy protections from the factory. Moreover, the rise of mega-dealers is resulting in an increasing retail power over the factory. Estimates of the used car market vary significantly, but it is clearly much larger than the new vehicle market in terms of number of units sold per year. Because new car margins for dealers have become significantly lower than used car margins, used car sales often subsidize the new car sector. Service and repair are labor-intensive industries that create significant local employment. Used car auctions have become multibillion dollar industries and are responsible for building a national infrastructure of used car supply that rivals the supply power of new carmakers in many ways. Many dealers have emerged as major stand-alone businesses and are beginning to redefine the postmanufacturing markets. An increasing number of dealers have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion. Many more have annual revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars. These powerful corporations are responding to customers and are creating multibrand shops that cross over many factories. They can also negotiate for large blocks of high-quality used cars, which further insulates them from any one automaker. The best known example of this new type of mega-dealership is the growing and successful used car chain CarMax. Owned by Circuit City, the $6 billion publicly traded consumer electronic company, CarMax is a chain of no-haggle dealerships with inventories of about 1,000 top-of-theline used cars at each location. Circuit City uses inventory control and computer technology to control costs and to guide and inform customers about the products offered. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 69  Estimates of the used car market vary significantly, but it is clearly much larger than the new vehicle market in terms of number of units sold per year.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  There are five CarMax stores operating on the East Coast, with projections for 50 U.S. dealerships by the year 2000. Eventually CarMax and similar operations may be players in the new car business as well: Chrysler has already agreed to sell CarMax a new car dealership in the Atlanta area. Other dealers specialize in certain forms of retailing by selecting customer niches. For example, companies are emerging that specialize in leasing specific classes of autos such as sports cars. These retailers are counting less on volume and more on developing strong customer relations for repeat business. The most notable specialty segmentation is that represented by the Saturn Corporation. The foundation of Saturn's success is that its entire value chain, from raw material through used cars, is coordinated to provide a pleasurable buying and driving experience for its customers. While other companies and many retailers have instituted high customer satisfaction policies, no other company has yet completed such an extensive systemwide overhaul as Saturn. Other dealers are experimenting with selling by phone or catalog-style retailing. Some dealers associate with buying clubs (e.g., those formed by unions, employers, the American Automobile Association, or other groups) and thereby get access to ""pre-sold"" customers who do not want to spend much time shopping. One dealer takes telephone orders; another sets up shop on the Internet. The amount of electronic retailing has soared since mid-1994, and new technologies have made possible a whole new structure for the auto retailing industry.  The foundation of Saturn's success is that its entire value chain, from raw material through used cars, is coordinated to provide a pleasurable buying and driving experience for its customers.  One Example of Retail Innovation: The Saturn Corporation The Saturn Corporation has developed partnering relationships with its dealers, a lean concept previously untested by the Big 3. In less than three years, Saturn established itself as one of the strongest brands in the compact car segment while foreshadowing the revolution in automotive retailing in the United States. Saturn's distribution and retailing system has achieved high market share and customer satisfaction since its inception in 1985.25  25  J. Chris Koenders and Wujin Chu, ""A Case Study of Saturn's Distribution Strategy"" (paper presented at the IMVP Research Briefing Meeting, June 1993).  70  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Saturn's innovative marketing strategy began with the objective of taking market share away from Japanese imports in the United States. Saturn's market planning team examined retailing best practices in a number of companies, both automotive and nonautomotive. They saw a customerpull instead of dealer-push marketing strategy as the solution. To achieve customer satisfaction, Saturn fostered relatively few dealerships--fewer than 200 in 1993 (only 10 to 20 percent of the number of dealerships for other major manufacturers' divisions in the United States)--thereby encouraging high unit sales per store, with Saturn allowing the retailer to add satellite outlets as demand increased. Moreover, Saturn's partnerships with its retailers empower those companies to be involved in the decision-making councils of the Saturn Corporation. Saturn retailers have avoided the pitfalls of undesirable salespeople by hiring completely new personnel in a rigorous screening process. Low turnover in sales personnel has been indicative of the success of this method. By following a consistent pricing policy, Saturn dealers eliminate the stressful negotiating process in which customers can feel ""had"" by dealers. Customers are shown a sheet with a grid illustrating the retailer's price schedule according to model and options. Consistent pricing appears to withstand cyclical fluctuation between strong and weak demand periods. Saturn's distribution strategy allows the company to respond better to market fluctuations, mainly because it is in closer touch with the market. Fewer layers of management, along with information technology and the integration of retailers into the decision-making bodies of the corporation, ensure that feedback is immediate and appropriate action can be taken quickly. Saturn's distribution system has clearly been highly successful, but it must be adopted in full by the retailer in order to work; the components of this system are interrelated and have been constructed to function as a single coherent strategy. Its considerable competitive success is directly attributable to the unanimous embracing of these principles by Saturn and its retailers.  Saturn's partnerships with its retailers empower those companies to be involved in the decision-making councils of the Saturn Corporation.  Urban Multibrand Retailers Another form of retail innovation, multibrand retailers may be as important as the Saturn innovation, although less publicized to date. This type of innovation is sparked by individual car dealers that have become successful enough to gain independent financial resources. In some ways, multibrand dealers are the opposite of the Saturn apThe U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 71   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  proach. Saturn seeks to form a deeper partnership between a fairly narrow single brand and a dedicated body of single-brand dealers. The other form of innovation assumes that it is best to strengthen a multibrand position while obtaining a firm position with a large retail buying population. This is the most effective distribution and retailing model in almost all nonautomotive industries and might be considered the Wal-Mart or Circuit City approach. In this case, the innovative dealer organization will become highly responsive to the customer since a key to the business is a large and loyal customer population. This approach leads to many innovations such as roving demo cars driven to customers' work or homes, easy-order toll-free numbers, a wide variety of financial purchase or lease options, and a host of other customer-driven systems that vary by region and market style. On the supply side, this kind of organization will try to get the best vehicles from a large number of factories, just as Circuit City tries to get the best-selling televisions from a number of television manufacturers. This strategy involves setting up systems that help the factory (i.e., the dealer itself becomes a desirable customer) and matching the factory supply to customer demand by creating sophisticated forecasting and inventory management systems.  Conclusions The postmanufacturing sector of the auto industry has always been important but has received little attention from auto manufacturing executives. However, distribution has become so critical to overall strategy that the sector is receiving much more attention than ever before. The sector is extremely diverse and is not necessarily amenable to the same tight coordination that auto manufacturers are building into their premanufacturing supply chains. However, linking the distribution sector to the manufacturing sector is the key to attaining better responsiveness to customers and to achieving competitive advantage. Innovators like CarMax are introducing a totally different dimension-- strong independent companies that are not tied to any particular manufacturer and that have the muscle to negotiate attractive conditions with several manufacturers. The manufacturers will have to adapt to this new reality if they are to profit from the economies possible in the distribution system.  Linking the distribution sector to the manufacturing sector is the key to attaining better responsiveness to customers and to achieving competitive advantage.  72  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  REGULATION OF AUTOMOBILES SOCIAL OBJECTIVES  TO  MEET  Mobility, Economic Development, and the Automobile Mobility and Transportation Congestion  I  ncreased mobility and economic development have progressed in unison, and advances in transportation and associated infrastructure have been leading indicators of a nation's prosperity. The automobile, as a source of increased individual mobility, has been a particularly significant factor in bringing about economic growth and social change.  The automobile has reconfigured urban landscapes and influenced lifestyles in the United States and in other parts of the developed world. The United States and the other developed countries rely primarily on the automobile to provide personal mobility. Figure 14 shows the significant increase in auto travel in the United States, Europe, and Japan since the 1970s.26 Although the United States is considered the most autooriented society, Europe and Japan are now adopting the same orientation, and auto ownership is increasing at a faster rate in these areas than in the United States.  Figure 14. Per Capita Travel  Although the United States is considered the most auto-oriented society, Europe and Japan are now adopting the same orientation, and auto ownership is increasing at a faster rate in these areas than in the United States.  26  Lee Schipper and Maria Josefina Figueroa, ""People on the Move: A Comparison of Travel Patterns in OECD Countries,"" Draft, International Energy Studies, Energy Analysis Program, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, Calif. (1994).  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  73   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  A massive increase in automobile usage is also occurring in developing countries, where mobility is absolutely essential to the development process. As figure 15 shows, developed countries typically have 300 to 600 cars per 1,000 population, but many large developing countries have fewer than 10 cars per 1,000 population. While the market for automobiles in the developed countries will continue, the major growth will occur in the developing countries. However, a number of factors, including traffic congestion resulting from aging, overloaded roads, are reducing society's ability to maintain, let alone improve, mobility. Society's ability to address and resolve these concerns is critically important to the future of the automotive industry. Congestion has advanced from an urban concern to a regional concern that affects entire metropolitan areas. From 1982 to the present, the percentage of urban areas in the United States with major congestion problems increased from 22 percent to nearly 50 percent, and it is still increasing. According to an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey of 114 U.S. cities, congestion is severe to very severe in 33 percent and a worsening problem in 68 percent of the surveyed locations. Nor does it appear that public transportation systems can provide either an alternative to reliance on the auto or a means of resolving congestion. These systems provide mobility primarily to individuals without access to an automobile (typically the young, old, poor, and handicapped). Even the best systems in the United States cannot satisfy more than a relatively small fraction of mobility needs. In spite of large capital and operating subsidies, public transport's worldwide share of travel has not increased and is not likely to increase in the future. David Bayliss, chief planner for London Transport, has just completed a global assessment of public transportation systems. He concludes that, even if the current rate of growth of metros continues, this ""would barely keep up with the growth of urbanization and would mean that the metros' share of the rapidly expanding urban travel market would slowly fall.""27 The Information and Communications Revolution and Future Mobility Needs Information and communication technologies will greatly affect both the need to travel and the means of travel and may address transportation 27  David Bayliss, ""UITP Public Transport Panorama,"" Draft, London Transport Planning, June 1, 1995.  74  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 15. Passenger Cars per 1,000 Population  Information and communication technologies will greatly affect both the need to travel and the means of travel and may address transportation congestion. congestion. These new technologies will enable the development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) in which the guideway (road), the driver, and the vehicle are integrated to enhance individual mobility and help to control congestion. Drivers will be able to request information on the best routes based on travel conditions. A visual display will give the driver navigation instructions. In addition, since the information system is aware of the status and location of all cars, various transportation system management strategies can be used to optimize the flow of vehicles. These strategies may include traffic light synchronization, ramp metering (and other forms of flow control), and electronic toll collection. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 75   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ITS provides a framework to operate a dynamic, coordinated system of mobility services, responding to both consumer demands and social concerns. Most projects focus on the middle range of the capacity spectrum--improving areawide traffic flow, with potential improvements in capacity estimated to be 10 to 30 percent. At the high end of the spectrum are vehicle control strategies that significantly increase the vehicle capacity of roadways. These strategies include ""car following,"" which will reduce the space between cars, and ""lane control,"" which will allow more lanes to be used in a right of way. Vehicle control strategies can also improve safety through object detection and collision avoidance systems. At the low end of the spectrum are the control of roadway capacity through pricing or traffic rationing policies. The real-time control system allows these policies to be implemented on an as-needed basis. ITS may provide a foundation for a new vision of mobility for the 21st century. However, implementation of an ITS strategy will be most effective if it can be coordinated nationally and internationally. With numerous technology choices and significant new market opportunities, extensive entrepreneurial activity and experimentation will motivate the innovation process. At the same time, the public sector has a significant stake in these systems, both as the owner of the roadways and as the potential operator of resulting traffic management systems. Furthermore, the need for system compatibility extends across national borders, making some international coordination necessary. ITS represents an interesting market opportunity for automotive companies. BMW, Daimler-Benz, and Volkswagen have teamed with Bosch and several other firms to implement ITS in German cities. General Motors has been an active participant in several ITS projects in the United States. As these examples suggest, ITS may provide automobile manufacturers an opportunity to expand their business to include providing broader mobility services.  Safety Concerns and the Automobile The level of safety achieved by today's vehicles far exceeds what was available several decades ago. While government regulation has played an important role, changes in consumer preferences and in public attitudes have also been important factors. The cumulative impact of government regulations requiring seat belts, padding, reinforcements, and a myriad of other features has made vehicles much safer in the event of a  76  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  crash. In addition, our transportation infrastructure, particularly the interstate system, incorporates more safety features. Auto safety has also improved as a result of consumer demand for safety features that go beyond current regulations, such as air bags and antilock braking. In other words, safety sells--even though safety regulations have added about $1,000 to the average selling price of passenger cars since 1980. Finally, society's attitudes toward intoxicated drivers, a major cause of traffic accidents, have hardened quite dramatically over the past few decades; a drunk driver is more likely to be viewed today as a callous criminal than a wayward reveler.  Auto safety has also improved as a result of consumer demand for safety features that go beyond current regulations, such as air bags and antilock braking.  Environmental Concerns and the Automobile In many ways, the automobile epitomizes the environmental challenge of today. It is a large consumer of a critical and limited fossil energy resource; in many countries it is the largest contributor to man-made greenhouse gas emissions and brings large amounts of lead into contact with people; it is the prime cause of urban smog; it is noisy and contributes to congested cities; and its manufacture produces an array of emissions, including those from the mining and production of steel and the painting of auto bodies. In spite of great strides in the technical performance of individual vehicles, many problems remain. The environmental challenges the automobile industry faces today are radically different from those it has confronted over the past three decades. These differences arise from major changes in their technological, economic, and political context, and their resolution will require a serious reexamination of the corporate and governmental institutions with which the automobile industry must interact. Automobile Technology and Environmental Initiatives Automobile technology has followed a trajectory of ever-increasing utility and complexity, both in general and with regard to the environment. Today's automobiles are vastly cleaner, more efficient, and less harmful to the environment than their 1970s counterparts.28 A whole series of environmental issues (such as the automobile recycling crisis of the 1960s; the need to reduce airborne emissions of lead, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides; the need to increase fuel economy; and more recently the global banning of chlorofluorocarbons) have 28  Today's automobiles are vastly cleaner, more efficient, and less harmful to the environment than their 1970s counterparts.  See Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association Auto Industry Statistics.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  77   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  been largely resolved through technologies that enable automakers to provide an economical product with equivalent (if not better) performance while meeting environmental objectives. Today the industry faces environmental challenges that raise complex and controversial issues and which can best be resolved with the full involvement of both government and industry. Today, the industry faces environment challenges that raise complex and controversial issues and that can best be resolved with full involvement of both government and industry. Zero-emission vehicle Although there is no such thing as a zero-emission vehicle (pollution will be created somewhere by the construction, use, and disposal of the vehicle), a number of initiatives bear this rubric. Spurred by the California clean air standards, the zero-emission car initiatives exemplify technology-forcing regulation. In spite of researchers' best efforts, electric battery technology critically limits even the most advanced electric car to roughly 100 miles between charges. With advanced battery technologies still years away from production, automakers must rely on lead-acid batteries, with the concomitant introduction of more lead, rather than less, into the automobile materials cycle. Furthermore, the influence of such vehicles on net air quality is increasingly in question, particularly in light of the continuing, documented air quality improvements arising from the replacement of old vehicles with newer ones. Weight reduction Reducing the weight of the automobile has been a design strategy since the onset of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, both by reducing vehicle size and by reducing weight through material substitution. However, material substitution is not a simple process. Changes in materials require changes in manufacturing technology, which is constrained by the economics of large-volume production. Henry Ford's assembly line would have been infeasible had he chosen to employ the traditional automobile material of his era, wood. It was his choice of steel, which could be formed and joined in seconds, that made his assembly line feasible and cost-effective. Today, considerable efforts are aimed at finding ways to process lightweight materials within the current automaker production line target of 75 vehicles per hour. Many advanced materials are available and are used in applications ranging from sporting goods to advanced aerospace vehicles. However, none of them are fabricated in ways even remotely compatible with the rates of automobile manufacture.  78  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Vehicle recycling Recycling in the United States is entirely a private industry undertaking, composed of a large and profitable infrastructure of dismantlers, shredders, and nonferrous metal processors supplying used parts and secondary metals. Recycling has emerged as an environmental issue for the automobile over the past five years, primarily in response to European initiatives, but it is actually a relatively old issue--one that has already been resolved once. For cars that are recycled (90 percent of the total manufactured), roughly 75 percent of the vehicle's mass is recovered and reused. But this means that 32.5 percent of all material that goes into automobiles in the United States is not recovered (most of it becomes landfill). Today's automobile recycling research is focused on the unrecycled content of the vehicle, particularly its polymeric content. An adjunct issue is the remaining 10 percent of cars that are not recycled at all. Automobile plastics are currently employed to improve vehicle safety (in interiors) and to reduce vehicle weight to save fuel and reduce emissions. These crucial materials largely become landfill because of the complexity of the plastic blends and the difficulty of recovering them through recycling. However, some analysis suggests that the benefits of reductions in weight and fuel consumption of composites, even if not recycled, may outweigh the costs of lower recycling rates. These environmental initiatives illustrate the key technological problem facing the automobile industry today. In each case, there are critical tensions among the technologies available to meet the initiative, the cost of their implementation, and their impact both on traditional measures of vehicle performance and on these newer indicators of performance. For example, if cars are to be largely composed of polymer composites, how are they going to be recycled? If the zero-emission vehicle is going to use batteries, how are the toxic heavy metals usually associated with batteries kept out of the environment? And how is vehicle safety maintained, when the vehicle's mass is reduced by 50 percent? Is the reduction of landfill consumption through increased recycling worth the net increase in energy used to run recyclable vehicles?  For cars that are recycled (90 percent of the total manufactured), roughly 75 percent of the vehicle's mass is recovered and reused.  Diverse Approaches to the Regulation of Auto Manufacture and Use As the preceding discussion indicates, increased mobility, via the automobile, has caused serious social concerns--allocation of scarce land The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 79   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  resources for transportation infrastructure, depletion of finite energy resources, and detrimental environmental and safety impacts. Governments have responded to these concerns in many different ways. They have limited new roadway construction, invested in public transport systems, attempted through transportation system management practices to squeeze more out of the existing infrastructure, implemented vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and, in some cases, introduced auto use disincentives, such as increased fuel taxes, auto-free zones, and road pricing. A few metropolitan areas have considered more draconian measures such as limited bans on driving if severe pollution conditions develop. The approach to regulation of the automobile varies significantly by country, reflecting different social priorities. Vehicle recycling is a high priority in Germany but of far less concern in the United States. Noise pollution from automobiles is a higher priority in Europe than in the United States. On the other hand, urban air pollution is a higher priority in the United States, particularly in areas such as Los Angeles, than in other countries. One example of the diversity of approaches is the use of gasoline taxes as a means of controlling auto use. The price of gasoline is $3 to $5 per gallon everywhere in the world except the United States, where the price is $1 to $1.50 per gallon. The United States has relied on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations aimed at automobile manufacturers to improve fuel economy rather than on an increased gasoline tax focused primarily on drivers. U.S. auto regulations tend to focus on new cars to achieve social objectives. An example is urban air pollution. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of the vehicles are producing 75 percent of the pollution. Removal of these ""clunkers"" is far more cost-effective than additional regulations on new cars. There are several ways to remove old vehicles. France and Spain have used vehicle buyback programs giving credits for trading in clunkers, and private industry has implemented ""cash for clunkers."" Devices to detect the highest polluting vehicles could also be used on the roadway instead of, or to supplement, vehicle inspection programs. The differences in national approaches to regulation lead to a serious design problem for the manufacturers, which are under increasing competitive pressure to make their products for international markets. Conflicting national and regional regulations discourage such global 80 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  The United States has relied on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations aimed at automobile manufacturers to improve fuel economy rather than on an increased gasoline tax focused primarily on drivers.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  approaches and may inhibit the competitiveness of the manufacturers. Indeed, national regulatory requirements might be used not to achieve social objectives but as a trade barrier to favor local manufacturers. Harmonization of international regulatory approaches and standards will help auto manufacturers adapt to globalization of markets. Furthermore, the regulatory process would be improved by requiring the consideration of interrelated social objectives, since regulatory actions to achieve one social objective, such as reducing air pollution, might have adverse effects on other social objectives. Finally, there are alternatives to the command-and-control regulatory approach embedded in many U.S. regulations. The creation of publicprivate research collaborations in the PNGV project reflects a novel approach to the technological challenge of controlling the environmental impact of the automobile. Market-driven strategies such as road pricing and emissions trading are also gaining more support. Company-based initiatives to improve the product and production process are also attractive alternatives to government-imposed regulations.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  81   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS  T Supply chains are long and complex, and there are many important players both upstream and downstream of the major manufacturers.  his study synthesizes our understanding of a complex global industry. It seeks to identify important trends,29 competitiveness issues, and topics relevant to public policy. The most important points are these: 1. The automotive business is played out on a worldwide stage. Supply chains are long and complex, and there are many important players both upstream and downstream of the major manufacturers. Furthermore, long supply chains exist within the major manufacturers as well. Consequently, competition can be thought of as occurring between supply chains (e.g., Nissan's vs. Ford's), with the added complexity that these chains may share common elements (e.g., component suppliers, dealerships, or even jointly developed products). Competition may also occur within supply chains (e.g., a manufacturer and component supplier each may want to add significant and unique value to the vehicle's electronics capabilities). Speed and flexibility (agility) in detecting shifts in market opportunities and reconfiguring the supply chains to respond to the opportunities will be the important rent-earning assets. 2. Although private sector companies dominate many aspects of the industry in the developed world, governments have historically played, and will likely continue to play, major roles in shaping the industry. The U.S. government has significantly influenced the emissions, economy, and safety features of cars. The government of China will likely decide which companies will be allowed to participate in the development of China's automotive industry as well as the rules of that development. 3. Although the auto industry is often referred to as ""mature,"" dramatic changes in product and market leadership, technology, distribution channels, and even the geography of production have occurred in the past two decades. 4. Sales volume is likely to continue its exponential growth in developing countries, and comparatively flat demand will continue in the developed world. As a result, much of the new  29  Industrial history is littered with predictions that look foolish in hindsight. Therefore, some of the projections based on current trends are bound to be wrong.  82  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  investment and perhaps many product innovations will occur in the developing world. Therefore, production volumes, real wages, and working conditions are likely to improve significantly in the developing world. Developing countries such as Korea hope to become significant exporters, above and beyond satisfying their burgeoning domestic markets. 5. Severe competition is likely in every segment of the supply chain, driving innovation in business models and causing continued turbulence in the standings of different players. Global sourcing is not likely to disappear; however, it will be tested as to when it is optimal for the entire manufacturing-todelivery process. In some cases, tight links with longtime partners may give better overall performance than use of lowest cost global suppliers. 6. Especially in the developed world, public sector pressures to make vehicles safer and more environment-friendly are unlikely to abate. These pressures will drive research and innovation in powertrains, fuels, electric vehicles, and lightweight materials. Given the twin pressures of government regulation and product competition, car companies that can develop and implement innovations in their supply chains are likely to benefit significantly in finding low-cost ways to meet requirements and put customer-desired features on the vehicles. 7. Cost competition will continue to encourage World Car concepts that amortize development efforts over more production units. Government regulations that are not harmonized across borders will continue to limit (at least to some degree) the attainable gains from this strategy, giving companies ample reason to lobby for improved regulatory coordination. 8. Predicting industry concentration trends is very difficult. For every argument for consolidation, there is another to support the contention that new competitors will surface. The economics of development and manufacturing support concentration, but the splintering of the distribution chain, the geographic dispersion of market demand, and the possible radical shifts in technology (e.g., nonferrous electric vehicles) may encourage disaggregation.  Especially in the developed world, public sector pressures to make vehicles even safer and more environment friendly are unlikely to abate. These pressures will drive research and innovation in powertrains, fuels, electric vehicles, and lightweight materials.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  83   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  9. The industry will continue as a knowledge-intensive industry, as opposed to just cutting, forming, and joining metal. Consequently, intellectual asset development--in manufacturing, marketing, engineering, etc.--will increase as a key competence for all firms. Strategies that jettison intellectual capital in response to cost pressures are likely to lead to ruin in the longer term. Firms should continue to experience significant returns on improved human relations throughout the organization and into the supply chain. 10. As in many other industries, electronics will continue its inexorable march into the product. Designers have myriad ideas for increased electronic control of the vehicle, and consumers seem to like such features. The continued shrinkage in cost and size of electronic components also makes them attractive. More broadly, the use of electronics will increase for control of the entire transit system, as well as on board the vehicle. These trends are likely to shift more economic power to the suppliers and integrators of automotive electronics technology. 11. Finally, we expect that the automotive industry will continue to be thought of around the world as ""the industry of industries,"" due not only to its sheer size in the economy of nations, but also to the high-dimensional complexity it exhibits. On so many dimensions--product complexity in design and manufacture, number of product attributes important to customers, process technology variety, supply chain size and complexity, rate of globalization, intensity of government involvement, complexity of labor relations, and impact on the landscape of human lives-- the automobile industry presents a scope of management challenges whose complexity dwarfs that of most other industries.  84  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  APPENDIX A: THE U.S. SUPPLIER BASE A CASE EXAMPLE OF GLOBALIZATION30  AND  M  EXICO:  or decades, the auto industry in the United States was concentrated near the Great Lakes. In 1975, half of all U.S. auto production (both parts and assembly) occurred in just 16 of over 3,000 U.S. counties. By 1990, however, these 16 counties accounted for only one-third of a similar level of automotive employment.31 A significant amount of automotive employment has moved out of the United States entirely: As of 1994, the top 15 U.S.-owned suppliers to North American manufacturing plants employed 130,000 people in Mexico.32 Much more employment has moved a shorter distance--to the Japanese transplant cluster just south of the Great Lakes region. However, this trend has positive aspects. For example, suppliers located outside the old geographical ""agglomeration"" tend to have more partnership-like relations with their manufacturer customers: The suppliers are significantly more likely to trust their customers and treat them fairly and also more likely to provide their customers with information about their process steps. Negative aspects of this geographical shift include farther travel for parts, which reduces the ability to implement JIT and causes more traffic congestion. It has also meant a drop in employment in the areas where the supply industry was once dominant. While overall employment in the auto supply sector (SICs 3714 and 3465) remained relatively constant between 1975 and 1990, Wayne County, Michigan, lost 18,000 jobs in this sector over the same 15 years--more than one-third of its total 1975 employment level.33 Despite the growth in employment in Mexico, the Mexican supply sector has a long way to go to be world-class. Mexican-owned suppliers, which are typically small shops (maquilas) without sophisticated quality assurance or product development techniques, find it difficult to attain cost and technology advantages over competing foreign suppli-  F  Suppliers located outside the old geographical ""agglomeration"" tend to have more partnershiplike relations with their manufacturer customers.  30  31 32 33  See Kaye Husbands, ""The Competitive Advantage of the Mexican Auto Parts Industry: Past Strategies, Current Capabilities, Future Outcomes,"" Draft Proposal, Williams College, Williamstown, Mass., 1995.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  85   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ers. Only a few large Mexican automotive suppliers that are associated with an industrial group or that are engaged in a successful strategic alliance with a foreign firm are likely to be competitive in price, quality, delivery, and service. Some of the reasons for this problem follow. n  Smaller scale of production in Mexico. Mexican parts plant managers and corporate executives report that their input costs are often significantly higher than those of their foreign competitors and that it is difficult to create low-cost products because of lower production volumes in their plants compared with foreign plants. Inefficient use of labor. Though manufacturing techniques of Mexican suppliers take advantage of relatively lower labor costs by using relatively more labor-intensive processes than their U.S. competitors, the employee turnover rate is much higher in Mexico (six times that in the United States). Training costs and missed learning curve economies therefore elevate the cost of operation. Incomplete integration of statistical process control (SPC). SPC is not prevalent among Mexican suppliers, and many of the firms that use SPC have not used it to adjust their production processes. For example, many companies claiming to have JIT in fact have significant stores of material or have shipping bottlenecks. Absence of CAD/CAM. Most Mexican suppliers get involved in the middle of the product development process or even later, partly because of the lack of CAD/CAM systems, other product development tools, integrated information commerce, or the human capital necessary to contribute to the product development and engineering processes.  n  n  n  86  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Human Resource Management Issues  34  Though Mexico is often considered a prime location of low-cost auto production in North America due to low Mexican wages, recent evidence based on a simulation study suggests otherwise.35 Because of the low wages (about $2 per hour before peso devaluation, including fringe benefits in maquiladoras), low education (typically sixth grade), and high turnover (90 to 100 percent), it is difficult to implement lean production policies such as quality circles and worker suggestion systems that produce continuous improvement.36  Though Mexico is often considered a prime location of low-cost auto production in North America due to low Mexican wages, recent evidence based on a simulation study suggests otherwise.  Supplier Issues The use of Mexican suppliers depends not only on their capabilities but also on their strategic fit in the auto manufacturer's global supplier network. The head of supplier management at a U.S. manufacturer in Mexico indicated that 97 percent of its Mexican suppliers are certified at the basic level, but none of those suppliers is likely to receive full-service supplier status; once the company has one or two traditional suppliers that can design a given product it is not necessary to certify yet another supplier at that level. Only Mexican suppliers that have already earned world-class status and that can compete with foreign suppliers on price, quality, and deliverability will be part of the global supplier network at the first tier. Of these suppliers, few, if any, will gain status as full-service systems integrators. The other suppliers that remain in business will most likely become second- or third-tier suppliers to OEMs or producers for the aftermarket.  34 35 36  Husbands, ""Competitive Advantage."" Ibid.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  87   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  APPENDIX B: REGULATORY POLICY HARMONIZATION  AND  T  he type and meaning of regulations affecting the automobile industry vary widely from one region or country to another. For regulatory control to produce maximal benefits, there should be interregional agreement on the standards and metrics of regulation (or at the very least a method of translating the metrics of one regulatory system to another).  Firms with assets devoted to multinational business such as the world auto industry will benefit from regulatory harmonization that maximizes the use of their assets.37 They will oppose divergent regulations that inhibit effective use of assets. On the other hand, firms with investments specific to a given domestic market may fight regulatory convergence, which threatens their investment by making entry easier for outsiders and will support heterogeneous regulations. Firms with investments featuring low ""asset specificity"" (i.e., those assets that are mobile or have valuable alternative uses) may relocate to less restrictive regulatory environments. Such movements facilitate heterogeneous regulations in what might be termed a ""competition in laxity"" among regulating regions. Dominant, established firms in concentrated markets are well positioned to shape regulatory environments to their advantage. With higher market shares, they can capture a larger proportion of regulatory benefits. Because of their size and wealth, they may have greater resources to achieve their regulatory goals through lobbying, funding, research, public relations, and differential absorption of regulatory costs. Dominant producers in highly concentrated industries or markets are likely to fight for regulations that provide (1) direct monetary subsidies, (2) constraints or subsidies on substitutes or complements of commodities produced, (3) price fixing, and (4) control over entry by new rivals. Environmental justifications for regulation may foster profits by legitimating principles for regulation and by adding environmentalists to regulatory coalitions.  For regulatory control to produce maximal benefits, there should be interregional agreement on the standards and metrics of regulation (or at the very least a method of translating the metrics of one regulatory system to another).  37  Oye and Maxwell, 1994.

We have an action-packed week planned for the Seventh National Clean Cities Conference in Philadelphia, especially designed for all Clean Cities coalitions and industry stakeholders. This year's conference will feature discussions and ""car talks"" on a variety of alternative fuel subjects, as well as a few new activities that are certain to  create plenty of excitement. Highlights include ""The Great Diesel Debate"" and inspirational thoughts from motivational speaker and comic/impressionist, Terry Braverman. Also, media personality Bill Nye will host the children's ScienceFest, a celebration of alternative transportation innovations for our next generation car buyer.   Our AFV Expo promises the biggest and best to date. And, thanks to our conference sponsors, we all can experience the spirit of Philadelphia with activities such as the Mummers Strut Lunch Munch, Invention Convention at the Franklin Institute of Science, Franklin Feast, and-for the early risers-a ""Streets"" of Philadelphia run/walk. Or you can sway to the sounds of the Philadelphia Boys Choir, tap your toes to the Legends of Jazz, or dance the night away and enjoy the city's skyline at ""The Eighth Floor Reception."" For more details about the conference, check out our Web site,  www.ccities.doe.gov/conference.shtml .   At the conference, we will highlight progress made toward achieving our goals-goals to increase the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), the amount of alternative fuel used, and the number of strong, self-sustaining Clean Cities coalitions. We announced these goals at the first Clean Cities Washington Day meeting held in March 2000. This March at Washington Day 2001, we unveiled new strategic approaches and offered new tools to help coalitions reach those goals. You can learn more about the new Clean Cities strategic plan and Washington Day 2001 in our cover story.                Also featured in this issue is an article about heavy-duty truck cab comfort units, or ""anti-idling devices."" These small, auxiliary power units provide truck operators with a cost-effective, efficient way to heat and cool their cabs-without running the engine, wasting fuel, and emitting additional pollutants. For more on ways to ""discourage idle behavior"", please see our feature on page 7.                Best wishes, and as usual, enjoy the issue.

Cover Story     C lean Cities Maps Its Strategy for a Decade of Success     T he Clean Cities' vision of the future is one of strong, vibrant, self-sustaining coalitions and niche markets in which alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleets operate 100% of the time on alternative fuel. It's a vision that includes 1 million AFVs on the road, using 1 billion gasoline gallon equivalents of alternative fuel. It is also a vision that could become reality. At Clean Cities Washington Day 2001, program staff and industry partners unveiled the specific strategies designed to help local coalitions build a viable national alternative fuels market.    The strategies presented at Washington Day 2001 are a result of stakeholder input at the first-ever Clean Cities Washington Day, held on March 15, 2000. At that meeting, Clean Cities Program staff announced three new long-term goals, designed to advance the most fundamental purpose behind Clean Cities-to promote AFVs and increase alternative fuel use:     1 million AFVs on the road (using alternative fuel) by 2010,  1 billion gallons of alternative fuel used in AFVs annually by 2010,  75% of Clean Cities coalitions self-sustaining by 2005.   To reach these goals, each Clean Cities coalition must increase AFVs in its region by 17 percent annually, with an average fuel consumption rate per vehicle of 850 gasoline-gallon equivalents (gge). It's an ambitious goal, but coalitions have a variety of new tools, services, and behind-the-scenes support mechanisms to help.    Washington Day 2001 provided a forum for Clean Cities staff and industry partners to discuss strategies to achieve the three Clean Cities goals, as well as future plans. The strategies are grouped into five main program areas:     Strong existing coalitions,  Self-sustaining niche markets,  Increased funding for AFV and infrastructure projects,  Legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development,  Mandates and/or alternatives to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).   Of the five program areas, the first two offer greatest opportunities for influence by the Clean Cities Program. Success in the other three depends largely on legislative action, policy, and the hard work of Clean Cities' industry partners (see box, page 5). At Washington Day 2001, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey unveiled the program's new strategic plan, which outlines DOE's efforts to help strengthen coalitions and build self-sustaining niche markets.      Stronger Coalitions  The desire for strong existing coalitions clearly extends from the Clean Cities goal to see 75% of coalitions ""self-sustaining by 2005."" According to the Clean Cities plan, one key to coalition strength is effective leadership from its coordinator. The coordinator is a person who is usually asked to wear many hats. Various roles can include facilitator, marketer, motivator, grant writer, organizer, researcher, liaison, mediator, public affairs specialist, manager, and fundraiser. Those responsibilities are difficult enough for any full-time person, but especially for a coordinator who works only part-time. Of the 80 Clean Cities coalitions nationwide, only about 15 percent have full-time coordinators.    Another source of strength is a diverse base of stakeholders. Coalitions should seek the active involvement of fuel providers, local and state governments, private fleet operators, and auto dealers. Other potential participants might be metropolitan planning organizations, large corporations, public relations firms, nonprofit organizations, airport management, universities, and local fire departments.     A thriving board of directors, composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds beyond alternative fuels, can make an enormous difference in building a sustainable coalition. Board members often donate money, actively promote the organization, and solicit funds on its behalf. Strong boards have members who tend to stay longer than one term and provide organizational continuity. They take an active part in setting goals and objectives and evaluating coalition progress.    Clean Cities will offer new training workshops to educate state and local policymakers and incorporate as a non-profit organization. Additional strategies under the ""strong existing coalitions"" heading include building fleet customer prospects, developing markets for alternative fuels, grant writing, and using existing outreach services such as the Clean Cities Hotline. All are described in the plan. The Clean Cities Program will offer training workshops in some of these areas in all six DOE regions, in 2001-02.      Filling a Niche  Niche market fleets, which often travel contained routes and are fueled at a central location, offer an enormous opportunity for alternative fuels. And high-mileage fleets can benefit from considerable cost savings using alternative fuel. Clean Cities coalitions have already identified several potentially successful niche markets, including airports, transit agencies, cargo and delivery companies, and government fleets. Although a wide variety of vehicle types can comprise a single niche, those vehicles can share an infrastructure, which helps ensure the success and longevity of the market.    In the Clean Cities strategic plan, the term ""self-sustaining niche markets"" implies economic interdependence in a given area. The prevalence of AFVs should help ensure local demand for trained technicians and a fueling infrastructure. The availability of those services, in turn, makes the purchase of AFVs more attractive. When it works, the market becomes economically self-sustaining, with little or no government involvement.    The plan includes a host of new numerical data on fuel use and the numbers of vehicles that comprise all four targeted niche markets (see table, page 6). Gathered from various sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Census Bureau, trade publications, and studies by consulting firms, the information will be extremely useful for gauging market potential within individual coalition regions.    Clean Cities coalitions will probably recognize some of the specific niche market strategies contained in the plan. But these ""tried and true"" activities, such as Advancing the AFV Choice events, coupled with new tools and strategies will help ensure sustainable AFV niche markets. Other niche market development strategies include Tiger Teams, large-scale project funding, and a renewed focus on fleets required to purchase AFVs by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).    Clean Cities Tiger Teams are teams of experts, assembled by DOE, to assist coalitions with technical problems. Their expertise includes vehicle operations issues such as performance, safety, technician training, and driver acceptance; and fueling infrastructure issues such as station design and siting, and working with fuel providers. Tiger Teams can also help evaluate potential market opportunities and determine project feasibility. Coalitions are expected to exhaust other resources before applying for Tiger Team assistance. More information is available at  www.ccities.doe.gov/tiger.html .    Coalitions are encouraged to pursue large-scale AFV-related projects, with the support of certain public sources of funding. One source is the federal government's new AIR 21 Program, which will provide as much as $2 million each to 10 airports, for AFV projects. Another, larger source is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which has provided more than $270 million to more than 200 AFV projects since 1991.     Working with EPAct-mandated fleets, such as federal and state governments, is not a new concept for Clean Cities. Federal agencies, however, must comply with a  new executive order, signed last year, which requires federal fleets to use alternative fuel in their AFVs more than 50 percent of the time by 2005. And although EPAct does not require state fleets to actually use alternative fuel in their AFVs, many states have authorized alternative fuel refueling policies or have taken the initiative to mandate alternative fuel refueling policies.     As stated in the Clean Cities plan, these mandated fleets offer coalitions an opportunity to build a refueling infrastructure network in which stations are ensured significant throughput. And although local governments are not covered by EPAct mandates, as school buses are often an effective AFV application. The Clean Cities plan encourages coalitions to identify all government fleet operators, but especially those affected by federal legislation, and hold a niche-specific Advancing the AFV Choice event to help them choose vehicles and to develop a fueling infrastructure.     Among the new tools to assist coalitions in obtaining funds is a national database of CMAQ-funded alternative fuel projects. With support from a DOE grant, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute is analyzing national trends and creating the database help Clean Cities coalitions determine how CMAQ funds are allocated. Current data is more difficult to use due to the different reporting styles of state and local governments.     The Clean Cities plan also highlights the products and tools for cultivating niche markets, which resemble the ones available in the ""strong existing coalitions"" program area (described earlier). Educational workshops, for example, will offer training in specific niches, such as airports. Other new tools include educational software on alternative fuel school buses and a shuttle bus took kit for coalitions interested in airport shuttle projects. Communications resources such as fact sheets and case studies are also available in print and via the Clean Cities Web site,  www.ccities.doe.gov .    The Clean Cities strategic plan was distributed to all Washington Day 2001 participants and was mailed to coalition coordinators who were unable to attend. An electronic copy of the plan is posted on the Clean Cities Web site at  www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml .

Kateri Callahan of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas and Paul Kerkhoven of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition tackled legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development. They discussed recent events on Capitol Hill and reviewed potential upcoming legislation to encourage AFV and fuel-efficient vehicle purchases as well as alternative fuel infrastructure investments. For their presentations and more on possible legislation, check out the Clean Cities Web site at  www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml .     To address increased funding for AFVs and infrastructure projects, Doug Howell of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute and Jake Plante of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discussed two of the largest grant programs available-DOT's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) grants and FAA's AIR 21 grants for airport projects. Coalitions must work closely with their local metropolitan planning organizations to ensure CMAQ funds are used to support alternative fuel projects, said Howell.      An open-microphone ""mini-town hall meeting,"" held in the afternoon, prompted an informal dialogue among all participants about topics such as the state of the natural gas industry, public access vs. niche market infrastructure, upgrading aging fuel stations, alternative fuels used as blends, and administrative expenses in DOE State Energy Program grants.

Feature Stories    D iscouraging Idle Behavior     M ost people don't think about how their favorite pair of shoes found its way to the shelf at the shoe store-or how their favorite brand of ice cream made it to their grocer's freezer. But neither commodity-nor thousands of others-would be possible without long-haul trucks.     Nationwide, about 480,000 long-haul, heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7 and 8) deliver goods from one place to another. Many travel hundreds of miles daily and frequently stop overnight. Sleeper cabs provide drivers with spacious and comfortable accommodations, but to keep the engine warm in the winter and maintain the cab's climate control conditions, most drivers leave the engine idling. According to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) estimates, the average truck sits idling for up to 1,800 hours each year-an equivalent of 75 straight days.    Just one hour of idling burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year, ANL says. Idling reduces fuel economy and wears the engine, requiring operators to invest more in maintenance and repair. It also pollutes the air. ANL estimates that each year, long haul heavy-duty trucks produce 10 million tons of carbon dioxide, about 60,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, and nearly 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide just by idling.    Truck operators must stay warm in the winter and cool during the summer, but now there is an alternative to idling. ""Anti-idling devices"" include direct-fired burners for cab and engine block heating; thermal storage devices for heating and cooling; and auxiliary power units for heating, cooling, and electrical power. These devices use only 10% to 15% of the fuel a diesel truck engine uses to heat the engine or run cab heating and air conditioning. They are commercially available, easy to install, efficient, and relatively inexpensive to operate.    By burning less fuel, cab comfort units dramatically reduce harmful emissions and, perhaps more important to cost-conscious drivers, they can save the average long-haul truck operator as much as $1,900 each year in fuel costs alone. Less time idling also means less wear on the engine, which enables operators to save on preventative maintenance and repair costs as well.     Despite the benefits, truck operators are still reluctant to pay the initial cost of cab comfort units, which are typically about $3,000. But ANL estimates that the significant fuel and maintenance savings will help operators see a return on their investment after just one year of use.      DOE has launched a program to promote the use of cab comfort units. The message: Don't Idle Your Profits Away! DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) created an exhibit booth to showcase cab comfort technology and communicate the anti-idling message to truck operators at truck shows.     ""Some truck drivers think our efforts are designed to make them suffer in unheated or uncooled cabs,"" said OHVT's Sid Diamond. ""That is not at all our intent. Our goal is to show drivers that they really don't need a 600-horsepower diesel engine to run their trucks' climate control units and appliances. Today there are a number of options that provide more energy efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solutions to control cab comfort and safety.""

F utureTruck Students Rise to the Challenge     S port utility vehicles (SUVs) have emerged as the most popular single vehicle class in the United States. But they generally use more fuel and produce greater exhaust emissions than passenger cars. They're big, and getting bigger, in terms of both popularity and physical size. There's no doubt that SUVs are here to stay. The challenge is to create an SUV that meets the needs of the future, with better fuel efficiency and lower emissions, while retaining the comfort and performance that consumers have grown to expect.     Fifteen teams of university students are rising to meet the challenge through FutureTruck, a four-year competition sponsored by DOE and General Motors (GM). Through FutureTruck, university students are building the SUV of the future, using advanced technologies such as fuel cells, light-weight materials, innovative powertrain strategies, and alternative fuels. GM is supplying seed money, prize money, vehicles (Chevrolet Suburbans), and facilities for testing and evaluation. Ford Motor Company will become the automotive sponsor in 2002 and 2003.    FutureTruck student teams compete in a series of performance events including acceleration, trailer tow performance, off-road handling, and on-road fuel economy; as well as static design events, such as consumer acceptability and engineering design. The vehicles are tested for full fuel cycle analysis, and each team must also prepare a written and oral technical presentation.     Last year marked the start of the four-year FutureTruck competition. With less than five months to modify their vehicles, students managed to increase on-road fuel efficiency of their Chevrolet Suburbans by 13%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (compared to stock vehicles). For more on last year's FutureTruck competition, see AFN Vol. 4, No. 2, or visit  www.futuretruck.org .    What's it like to be a student participating in FutureTruck? ""It's inspiring,"" said Steve Gurski, team leader for Virginia Tech. ""In FutureTruck there's always a new challenge that no one has ever met before."" According to Gurski, undergraduate students and their team leaders spend as many as 30 hours per week on their vehicles. Team leaders-typically graduate students-spend even more time. They also help leverage funds and support for the project, write reports and waivers, and direct resources to help solve problems when necessary. Team leaders ensure that the team, and the vehicle, are ready for the June competition.     For many students, FutureTruck is a life-changing experience. ""I got involved because of the toys, not realizing what a difference it would make in my career,"" said Michael Ogburn, last year's team leader for Virginia Tech. ""Three years of playing with cars and trucks left me so aware of my passion to make a difference in the struggle to save the planet, that it makes my head spin to imagine doing anything else,"" he said.    The FutureTruck 2001 competition will be held June 4-13. Events will be held at the GM Proving Ground in Milford, Mich. Teams will then travel to Washington D.C. for an awards ceremony and vehicle display on Capitol Hill.

The NGNGV Program vision is to build one new medium-duty (Class 3-6) CNG truck, and one new heavy-duty (Class 7-8) LNG truck by 2004, using technologies to reduce emissions of particulate matter as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Typical NOx levels for today's low-emission natural gas trucks are in the range of 2-2.5 grams per brake-horsepower. The program has targeted NOx emissions of roughly one quarter of that level, at .5 grams.     Specific technological advances may take the form of improved engine-combustion designs, new dual-fuel systems, and better catalytic treatment of exhaust. The program is expected to draw interest from original equipment manufacturers as well as suppliers of sensors, engine-control systems, and fuel-air delivery systems. Information is available from Kevin Walkowicz at 303-275-4492, or at  www.ctts.nrel.gov/ngngv .     A lliance to Help Boost Green Vehicle Market    D OE is working with government and industry to help build a stronger market for ""green"" vehicles. A potential alliance of federal agencies, state and local governments, vehicle manufacturers, environmental groups, fuel associations, and universities has met several times to discuss joint efforts to increase demand for clean and efficient vehicles. The group's top priorities include market research to help define target audiences and shape public messages and an outreach campaign to alert the public of its clean vehicle choices. Stay tuned to AFN for more information on green vehicle activities.     P ropane Vehicle Rally     T he great American road rally was alive and well in early February as more than 20 propane powered vehicles converged on the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition in Kansas City, Missouri. The vehicles began their journeys at various locations throughout the West and Midwest, traveling along major interstates and stopping at propane refueling stations along the way. At each stop, drivers gave out information about the road rally and propane vehicles, and had a chance to interact with the public. They also collected signatures from the people they met during the rally into a logbook. Rally drivers traveled a combined total of more than 4600 miles and passed through 11 states and Monterrey, Mexico.     Approximately 27 government entities, associations, and companies worked together to make the road rally and propane conference a success. Sponsors included several Clean Cities coalitions, propane associations, propane distributors, and vehicle manufacturers. Ernie Oakes, the Regional Clean Cities Program Manager for the Department of Energy/Denver Regional Office applauded the venture and said, ""The rally showed local communities that the propane industry and automobile manufacturers are working together to bring a cleaner auto fuel to the general public for use in their everyday lives.""    Participating in the event were representatives of both government and private industry, from Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, and Monterrey, Mexico. The rally was the first event of its kind featuring dedicated propane vehicles.     On Monday, February 5, the rally participants arrived in Kansas City just in time for the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition. The conference featured displays from the major auto manufacturers, propane distributors, and propane associations. Lead vehicles from each leg of the rally were driven onto the conference floor, where they remained on display throughout the conference. The signatures that were collected at the road rally stops were also on display during the conference.      N iche Markets     Delivering Clean Air, Right to Your Door    Every day they travel from warehouses and local businesses to neighborhood stores and homes, delivering everything from flowers and dry-cleaned clothes to pizza and newspapers. Without delivery vehicles, we'd go without many of the amenities we've grown to depend on. And with e-commerce enabling Web users to order groceries and even the latest videos on-line, more and more consumers enjoy the convenience of home delivery.   As high-fuel use, high-mileage vehicles operating in small, defined geographic regions, delivery vehicles are ideal candidates for alternative fuels. According to the Census Bureau's most recent vehicle inventory and use survey, more than 5 million light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks are involved in cargo and freight delivery. More important, however, is that these vehicles use approximately 5.8 billion gallons  of fuel each year-obviously big potential for significant alternative fuel use (and significant petroleum displacement).    Several highly successful alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) delivery fleets - from large, national corporations like United Parcel Service to smaller, regional companies such as Salt Lake City's Newspaper Agency Corporation and Flower Patch, Inc.-are currently featured on the Clean Cities success stories Web site. Below are several other delivery companies that are also enjoying the benefits of AFV use.     McShan Florist, Dallas: The Dallas-Fort Worth Clean Cities Coalition recently recognized McShan for operating an almost 100% alternative fuel fleet. Twenty-five of the company's delivery vans (or 80% of its entire fleet) run on compressed natural gas (CNG). The vans refuel at local public stations, and owner Bruce McShan offers creative incentives to encourage drivers to fuel with CNG. McShan decided to start using CNG 10 years ago, and has enjoyed significant savings associated with CNG.     Connie's Pizza, Chicago: Since 1997, Connie's Pizza has been delivering pizza throughout the Chicago area, using CNG vehicles. Of the company's 50 vehicles, 18 are CNG Chevy S-10 pickups. Connie's also owns slow-fill compressors that refill vehicles overnight. According to Ivan Matsunaga at Connie's Pizza, the company initiated its AFV effort to comply with an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires private fleets to purchase a certain number of AFVs. But there are other benefits. According to Matsunaga, it's the right thing to do environmentally, and the company benefits from the long-term economic advantage of using a less expensive fuel.     Schwan's Sales Enterprises, Marshall, Minn.: Schwan's Sales Enterprises manufactures, markets, and distributes frozen food to commercial and non-commercial customers in communities nationwide. An experienced AFV user, Schwan's has relied on propane for more than 22 years. Owner Marvin Schwan decided to convert his fleet to propane in response to gasoline shortages and unstable prices in the late 1970s. Today, the company's fleet is more than 90% alternative-fueled. Of its 7,500 vehicles, more than 7,000 are dedicated propane medium-duty vehicles. And with AFVs in 48 states, Schwan's is no stranger to the Clean Cities Program. The company is a Clean Cities stakeholder in the Atlanta, Colorado Springs, Evansville (Indiana), and California's Northwest Riverside County, as well as New York's Capital District, Central Oklahoma, Vermont, and the Alamo Area coalition in Texas.     According to Alan Macht, director of fleet operations, company AFVs travel about 190 million miles and consume 45 million gallons of propane annually. To ensure its success, Schwan's has taken a proactive approach to driver education, providing training in refueling and vehicle operations. Vehicles are refueled at the 600 Schwan's depots located across the country. According to Macht, the drivers have been pleased with vehicle performance. Because Schwan's truck operators are commissioned sales people, they have a higher stake in the vehicles. If their trucks don't function, drivers don't make money. As for expanding its AFV fleet, Macht said the company will first focus on larger urban, non-attainment areas.

USPS Delivers Clean Air and Energy Security   The United States Postal Service (USPS) is the nation's ultimate delivery fleet. Its vehicles travel more than 1 billion miles per year, collecting mail from more than 312,000 street mail collection boxes and delivering to every household in the country. And through rain, snow, sleet, and hail, the USPS does much more than deliver mail. With 33,691 alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) expected on the road by the end of the year, the USPS continues to be a leader in the drive to help strengthen our nation's energy security and clean the air.     By the end of the year, the USPS delivery fleet will include nearly 28,700 AFVs, most of which will be flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs). More than half of the projected 21,275 FFVs are already on the road; approximately 1,000 vehicles roll off the assembly line each month and are immediately placed into service. More than 7,300 USPS delivery vehicles are powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), and 52 vehicles use propane. Meanwhile, 523 electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to be on the road by the end of the year.     But there's more to USPS operation than delivery-some 4,519 AFVs either haul mail or are used for administrative business. For example, by the end of this year, 20 medium-duty EVs will be used to haul mail, while postal employees can drive any of the 3,838 FFVs or 659 CNG vehicles to conduct administrative business.     ""We are working closely with the alternative fuel industry to increase the use of each alternative fuel represented in the postal fleet,"" said Marguerite Downey, USPS Alternative Fuel Program Manager. ""For example, the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition and others are working with us to establish E85 pumps at fueling stations in communities where we are currently concentrating our FFVs. We are confident that our efforts will lead to continued expansion of alternative fuel usage in our own fleet, as well as neighboring fleets and individual drivers,"" she said.     F rom the Automakers     Hybrids are Big at Detroit's Auto Show    Hybrid sport utility vehicles (SUVs) took to the stage at the North American International Auto Show, held in Detroit in January. With the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius already on the streets and interest in energy efficiency on the rise, several automakers used the auto show as a forum to showcase their upcoming plans to bring advanced technology vehicles to market.     Ford Motor Company announced its plans for a hybrid Explorer, which will debut sometime after the Escape hybrid is introduced in 2003. Ford showcased the hybrid Escape at the Los Angeles International Auto Show a week before the show in Detroit. The Escape, expected to get 40 miles per gallon, will use an electric motor for propulsion and a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Explorer will use a six-cylinder engine with electric assist. Both models will feature integrated starter-generator technology that automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops, such as at a traffic light. The Explorer hybrid will also employ a regenerative braking system for its 42-volt battery used to provide an acceleration boost at start up. A smaller 12-volt battery will supplement power to run devices such as lamps and radios. For more information, check out Ford's hybrid Web site:  www.hybridford.com .    Among the newest concepts DaimlerChrysler unveiled at the Detroit auto show was the Dodge PowerBox, a hybrid-electric SUV. Unlike other hybrid SUVs, the PowerBox combines a supercharged V-6 engine that uses compressed natural gas (CNG) and an electric motor to supplement power and increase efficiency. A large SUV, the PowerBox concept has room for eight passengers, comparable in size to the gasoline-powered Dodge Durango, but with 60% better fuel economy. And because it's powered primarily by CNG, the PowerBox runs cleaner, with near zero emissions. For more information, visit  www.daimlerchrysler.com .     Building on last year's Precept hybrid concept vehicle, General Motors unveiled its new hybrid propulsion system, the ParadiGM, which the company will be able to apply to a variety of vehicles, from passenger sedans to SUVs and trucks to commercial vehicles. The ParadiGM system combines a conventional V-6 or an inline four-cylinder engine with two electric motors and a battery pack to provide increased efficiency. The first hybrid application will be a mid-size SUV with fuel economy 20% better than its conventionally powered counterparts. GM's hybrid SUV is expected to debut in 2004; the company announced that at least 7,000 vehicles will be produced in the first year. More hybrids may follow, depending on market demand. For more information on GM's ParadiGM system, visit  www.gm.com .

Honda Civic GX receives California's AT-PZEV certification    The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in late December granted American Honda Motor Company partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV) certification for its natural-gas-powered Civic GX.     The rating came just weeks before the 2001 model car, described by the manufacturer as ""cleanest on earth,"" hit the U.S. market.    The standard, which falls under the super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) provision of CARB's recently released ZEV mandate, requires vehicles to support 15-year, 150,000 mile emission system durability. They must also have zero evaporative emissions. Under this stringent SULEV requirement, the Civic GX is now the first advanced-technology, partial-zero emission vehicle (AT-PZEV) says Stephen Ellis, American Honda's Manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicles.     An AT-PZEV gets distinct recognition and greater credits because it has a reduced ""full cycle"" emissions impact. ""Being the first to receive AT-PZEV status is nice for Honda and the near-zero emission Civic GX. It also proves the value of natural gas as a long-term alternative to gasoline,"" Ellis says.    Approved in January, CARB's new ZEV rule will require the sale of an estimated 4,650 full-size model year 2003 electric cars in California, and a comparable number of other super-clean and advanced technology vehicles as well. The ZEV minimums will rise to about 22,000 vehicles in 2010, and 50,000 in 2018. The SULEV provision allows car manufacturers to receive partial credits with PZEVs, including AT-PZEVs such as the Civic GX.      DaimlerChrysler Adds Neighborhood Electric Vehicles to Its Portfolio    DaimlerChrysler announced its acquisition of Global Electric MotorCars (GEM), becoming the first major automaker to sell neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) in the United States.    GEM, based in North Dakota, produces two- and four-passenger NEVs that can be licensed for use on public roads. The vehicles recharge in about eight hours using 110-volt household alterative current. NEVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are well suited for niche applications including local governments, parking enforcement, university and business campuses, and planned communities. The city of Denver, for example, through its ""Take Charge"" program, provides three NEVs for city employees to use for business downtown.     ""DaimlerChrysler is excited about the emerging market of neighborhood electric vehicles and the opportunities that GEM affords,"" said Mike Clement, Director of Alternative Fuel Sales and Marketing. ""This acquisition fits well with DaimlerChrysler's alternative fuel vehicle strategy.""      C lean Cities Roundup     Animals Need Clean Air, Too    The animals-and their keepers-at the Tulsa Zoo can all breathe a little easier, thanks to the zoo's electric vehicles. The zoo uses two electric Ford Rangers and three electric ""trikes"" (bicycles with three wheels) to travel from building to building. The pickups are also used in daily grounds-keeping activities. The Tulsa Zoo is a division of Tulsa Parks, a member of the Tulsa Area Clean Cities Coalition.      Birmingham Boasts Natural Gas Buses    The Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) has joined a growing number of transit agencies across the country in a commitment to use compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. The BJCTA is 57% alternative-fueled; of its 77 buses, 43 use CNG. According to Mark Bond, Director of Fleet Operations for City Transit (a BJCTA contractor), drivers are particularly pleased with the new buses' power and acceleration. Each of the CNG buses is clearly marked as a clean fuel vehicle, to help inform Birmingham residents of their transportation choices. The city of Birmingham is working towards a Clean Cities designation.       Oklahoma Utility Nears 100% Alternative Fuel Use    Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) is closing in on 100% alternative fuel use. Of the utility's 1,120 vehicles, more than 800 (or 71.4%) run on natural gas. According to ONG's John Siska, last year the fleet used approximately 500,000 gallons of natural gas, and it plans to use more. ""Our goal is to reach 100% of our fleet,"" said Siska. ""Any vehicle that can possibly be converted and is close to refueling will either be converted or replaced with an original equipment vehicle,"" he said. Last year, Natural Gas Fuels ranked ONG third on its list of the top utility natural gas fleets, and the utility tied for first in alternative fuel vehicle projections. ONG is an active member of the Clean Cities coalitions of central Oklahoma and the Tulsa area.      Three New Coalitions Join Clean Cities Program    By summer 2001, more than 80 coalitions will be part of the Clean Cities network. Each new coalition is the first in its state to join the Clean Cities Program.     Triangle Clean Cities, which serves the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, was designated the 80th Clean Cities coalition on March 19. Because the event was within driving distance from Washington, DC, several members of DOE's Clean Cities team showed their support for the coalition and for AFVs by driving the more than 250 miles to North Carolina in a natural gas vehicle and a propane vehicle. The Triangle Clean Cities Coalition's designation celebration, held at North Carolina State University, was part of an event staged to help advance fuel choices in the area. With flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) making up a majority of the region's more than 1,700 vehicles, the coalition remains active in promoting the increased use of E85. Last year, then-Governor Jim Hunt issued a proclamation announcing his support for the Triangle Clean Cities effort and mandating E85 use in state fleets whenever possible.     The Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition (TC4) will become the 81st member of the program on May 31, 2001. The TC4, in conjunction with the Minnesota E85 team, has been successful in building an alternative fuel infrastructure network, and last year celebrated the opening of the region's 50th publicly accessible E85 station. With its partners, the TC4 has also initiated a large-scale educational and outreach effort to promote E85 use by the public, and has set specific fuel use and fuel sales goals to help target its efforts.    The Vermont Clean Vehicles Coalition is planning a designation ceremony for this summer. The coalition serves one of the most rural Clean Cities regions of the country. It has promoted alternative fuels for several years, and has received significant media attention for having placed AFVs in fleets throughout the state. The coalition is also unique in terms of active participation by government leaders, including both of Vermont's U.S. Senators, its congressional representative, and its governor.     F ederal News     DOE Names Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Project Recipients    DOE's Federal AFV USER Program recently awarded funds for three separate projects, designed to increase the availability of alternative fuels such as E85 and compressed natural gas (CNG). The successful entries were chosen from proposals submitted in response to a solicitation in June 2000.     The Federal AFV USER Program supports the expansion of alternative fuel infrastructure by encouraging the placement and use of federally owned AFVs in six specific cities: San Francisco; Denver; Albuquerque; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Salt Lake City; and Melbourne-Titusville, Fla.    Roughly $266,000 in federal funding was awarded for the three projects, which have a combined total value of $812,000 including the cost share contributed by non-federal partners. Each partner's contribution was at least 50%. Generally, the projects will support fleet managers and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) buyers. They include:    The Twin Cities AFV USER project, ""Using the Federal Fleet to Model the E85 Way,"" a customer education and marketing project that promotes the use of E85 fuel, $214,000;  Pinnacle CNG Co.'s DOE/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) CNG Refueling Station, for the installation and operation of a CNG fueling station at LLNL, $465,000; and   The Technological Research and Development Authority's deployment of ethanol fuel infrastructure for federal fleets in Melbourne-Titusville, for the installation and operation of an E85 fueling station at the Kennedy Space Center, $184,000.   Because federal fleets are required by Executive Order 13149 to reduce petroleum consumption, DOE is targeting infrastructure and promotion projects to benefit them. Although the primary intent of the projects is to support the federal fleet, they were also evaluated by their potential to provide alternative fuel to state and local government fleets, commercial fleets, and the public.

Second-round Rebate Funding Now Available     Coalitions that received rebates from Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) program in 2000 may be eligible for a second wave of funding. To qualify, coalitions have to have exhausted the money granted in the first round of rebates.    Formed to help coalitions reduce the cost of AFVs, the program offers rebates of $2,000 per vehicle to coalition stakeholders who purchase AFVs. Under the terms of the deal, the funding must be used to buy dedicated original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alternative fuel vehicles.    For more information, contact your Department of Energy (DOE) Regional Clean Cities manager.     Fleet Buyer's Guide Adds Electric Bikes, Hybrids, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles     Electric bikes, hybrid cars, and neighborhood electric vehicles were recently added to DOE's Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide. The site walks fleet managers through a step-by-step process that helps them identify whether Energy Policy Act (EPAct) regulations apply to them, and, if so, helps them make informed alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase decisions.     Although electric bikes, HEVs, and neighborhood electric vehicles don't qualify for EPAct credit, they were added to the Web site because many fleets are interested in purchasing them. Currently the Buyer's Guide has specifications and information on two HEVs, eight neighborhood electric vehicles, and more than a dozen electric bikes. Although the site was developed to assist fleets, the public is welcome to use it.    Visit  www.fleets.doe.gov , and click on the link for Advanced Technology Vehicles.      Where in the World are Alternative Fuels?    The redesigned Clean Cities International Web site answers that and many other questions about Clean Cities around the world. The site, which features a special section in Spanish, is packed with detailed information about the program, the countries and cities involved, new publications, upcoming international events, and much more. Modeled after DOE's Clean Cities Program, Clean Cities International works with governments, non-governmental organizations, and the U.S. alternative fuel industry to help establish foundations for viable alternative fuel markets in other interested countries.

We reflected how the disruption in our nation's petroleum supply upset the lives of many Americans. Now we look forward to our nation's progress as we face a new year, a new century, a new millennium, and the bright promise that clean energy technologies hold for our future.  The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) leads the research, development, and deployment of clean, efficient, and renewable energy technologies. These technologies play a big role in meeting our nation's energy needs, enhancing our natural environment, and strengthening our national competitiveness in the production of sustainable energy. The results of this leadership are dramatic; the United States now has a more efficient industrial base, a robust energy technology industry, and significant energy savings in our homes, vehicles, offices, and government buildings. Clean energy also requires clean vehicles and clean alternative fuels, such as those being promoted by the nationwide Clean Cities network. Clean fuels provide lower emissions, use less petroleum, and are often renewable, paving the way to a sustainable transportation future. As we enter the new millennium, the clean energy technologies supported and promoted by DOE will continue to play a key role in providing Clean Energy for the 21st Century.  ""Clean Energy for the 21st Century"" is the theme EERE has adopted to promote events and activities leading up to Earth Day 2000. This theme describes the goals and objectives of EERE programs, like Clean Cities, Building America, and Million Solar Roofs, and also coincides with the Earth Day Network's Earth Day 2000 theme of ""New Energy for a New Era."" The Earth Day Network, a non-profit organization established by Earth Day founding father Denis Hayes, is planning a series of events leading to Earth Day 2000, the 30th anniversary of the first Earth Day. The network hopes to raise awareness of global warming and climate change issues, and promote a ""rapid transition from outdated, polluting, wasteful energy systems to efficient systems built on clean, safe, renewable energy sources."" For more information about the Earth Day Network, check out http://www.earthday.net. For more information about DOE's energy efficiency programs, including Building America, Million Solar Roofs, and others, go to http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs. DOE's ""Clean Energy for the 21st Century"" campaign kicks off during October, which has traditionally been celebrated as Energy Awareness Month, and will culminate on Earth Day 2000. Many transportation-related activities and events are planned throughout October. The Model Year 2000 Fuel Economy Guide, although not available in hard copy until late in November, was also posted on the Web. The guide is an interagency effort between DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It will help consumers compare the fuel economy of Model Year (MY) 2000 vehicles, including cars, light trucks, minivans, sport utility vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). ""Our goal was to make the 2000 guide more readable and used by more people,"" said David Rodgers, Director of DOE's Office of Technology Utilization. ""We're also proud of the dramatically redesigned Web site that showcases alternative fuel and advanced technologies, allows side-by-side comparison of vehicles, and highlights other environmental attributes of MY2000 vehicles,"" he said. To view the MY2000 Fuel Economy Guide online, or to search the database of previous model year Fuel Economy Guides, check out: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg.  3   There is much anticipation about the new model year.

The vehicles include two hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)-- the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius--and Ford's electric vehicle (EV), the TH!NK. Honda's Insight and Toyota's Prius will be the first HEVs ever available to U.S. consumers. The introduction of the HEVs will help spur competition among all automakers in pursuit of early market entry for advanced, highly efficient vehicles. To increase fuel economy and lower emissions, HEVs employ both a gasoline-powered engine and an electric motor to power the vehicle. The battery pack for the motor is recharged by the engine, which acts as a generator, and also from the electricity generated by braking. This hybrid technology, which results in better fuel economy, means the batteries never have to be recharged from an outside source. Honda's Insight will go on sale this December. The Insight will be certified to meet California's ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) standards, and is powered by Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. The hybrid technology, along with a lightweight aluminum body structure and aerodynamic design, enables the two-passenger Insight to average more than 70 miles per gallon on the highway, according to Honda. Honda showcased the Insight at a reception in Washington, D.C., September 23-24, 1999. The event, held for White House, DOE, EPA staff, and the press at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, included a ride-and-drive opportunity for attendees. A one-hour briefing was also held at DOE the next day to promote staff exposure to the new technology. Following this briefing, five Insights were available to test drive. Although Toyota's four-door sedan, the Prius, will arrive in the United States after Honda's HEV, it won't be far behind, with an expected entrance in early 2000. The Prius has the distinction of being the world's first production HEV, demonstrating impressive sales and getting great reviews in Japan since it was introduced there in December 1997. The Toyota Hybrid System (THS) also employs advanced technology, making use of both an electric motor and a gasoline engine to increase fuel economy and lower emissions. The Prius, a four-door sedan, uses a 1.5liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a permanent magnet motor powered by a sealed nickel-metal hydride battery to give it an estimated fuel economy of 66 miles per gallon (based on actual city test driving in Japan). The all-electric TH!NK, a two-seater measuring only 10 feet in length, is manufactured by Pivco Industries Ltd., a Norwegian subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Ford plans to market vehicles in the U.S. next year, after its introduction in Norway. TH!NK is constructed with a Wieck Photo Database  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07326  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07325  Pictured top to bottom: A look under the hood of the Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle; Honda Insight; Ford Th!nk electric city vehicle; Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle  Wieck Photo Database  combination of aluminum and thermoplastics, providing body strength and light weight. According to Ford, the battery pack gives the vehicle a ""real world"" range of about 50 miles between charges, and its 27 kW alternating current (AC) induction motor gives it a top speed of 55 mph. The plant in Oslo, Norway, is scheduled to produce 1,500 vehicles in 2000. The Insight, Prius, and TH!NK offer exciting glimpses into the automotive technologies of the near future. Although electric vehicles are already in production in the United States, the TH!NK shows that automakers are dedicated to developing and promoting EVs. The advanced vehicle technology that has been the ""talk of the industry"" is almost here!

DOE's Dan Reicher, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, welcomed the Florida Space Coast Clean Cities Coalition in a ceremony held at the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cocoa, Florida. The designation kicked off Energy Awareness Month, and also provided an opportunity to inaugurate the MelbourneTitusville-Kennedy Space Center area as one of the six selected locations for the new Federal AFV USER Program (see p. 10 for more on the USER program). The Florida Space Coast Clean Cities Coalition serves a nine county area in eastcentral Florida, including Brevard, Indian River, Lake, Seminole, St. Lucie, Osceola, Orange, Okeechobee, and Volusia Counties. Prominent stakeholders include the Florida Solar Energy Center, NASA-Kennedy Space Center, Walt Disney World, City Gas Company, People's Gas, and the United States Postal Service. #76  Manhattan, Kansas On October 4, the ""Little Apple"" was officially designated into the Clean Cities Program. DOE's Richard Moorer, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technologies, joined Manhattan Mayor Roger Reitz to celebrate Manhattan as the 76th Clean Cities Coalition. The ceremony, which was held outside the downtown shopping mall, included a vehicle display and vendor booths, and was held at 5:00 p.m. to maximize public attendance. Earlier that day, the Manhattan coalition celebrated the opening of a publicly accessible natural gas refueling station. Manhattan stakeholders include the city of Manhattan, Kansas; Kansas State University; Fort Riley; and Transportation Design and Manufacturing, a local AFV conversion company.  The 17th National Natural Gas Vehicle Conference and Exhibition was also held during Energy Awareness Month, October 3-5, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The agenda featured special ""tracks"" tailor-made for fleet managers. Topics included: how to get started with NGVs, emissions issues, refueling infrastructure, regulations, and a special session on partnerships among original equipment manufacturers and their customers.  Ford Excursion to Roam the Rockies Kids at the Boys and Girls Club in Denver now have a new, spacious, CLEAN ride ready to transport them to their next outdoor adventure. On October 14th, after announcing the availability of its dedicated propane-powered Excursion in MY20 0 0, representatives from Ford Motor Company presented the keys to one of the new propane, super-ultra-low emission vehicles to Denver 's Mayor Wellington Webb. Mayor Webb then passed the keys, along with camping gear also donated by Ford, to the local Boys and Girls Club. Now they had the vehicle to get to the campsite and the gear to camp, but what about the fuel? That's when Amerigas stepped in. In addition to announcing the development of a new public propane station in Denver, Amerigas donated 50 0 gallons of the fuel to the Boys and Girls Club to help them power their new Ford Excursion.  The 2nd Annual Riverside Clean Cities/ICTC Fleet Operator Workshop The Northwest Riverside County Clean Cities Coalition will celebrate its second anniversary as a designated member of the Clean Cities Program on October 27th. Similar to the coalition's anniversary celebration last year, the event will be held in conjunction with the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC) Fleet Operator Workshop. The focus will be on heavy-duty vehicle use in California, Nevada, and Arizona, and will include panel presentations and table talk sessions with alternative fuel fleet operators.  6  Ford Motor Company/PIX 07369  NGV Conference and Exhibition   Spotlight on Niche Markets  The Sky's the Limit for Airport AFVs  When most people think of the airport, airplanes--obviously-- come to mind. But what about all the ground services that transport people, baggage, airline equipment, and food service to make everything run smoothly? Airports across the nation have been looking at the pollution caused by these ground transportation services as a perfect opportunity to use alternative fuels and vehicles to improve the air quality in and around the airports.  Los Angeles, California Serving 61.2 million passengers each year provides Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) with a great opportunity to expose travelers to AFVs. LAX leads the introduction of AFVs into airports by working with local agencies, which include the city of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) and the Southern California Gas Company. More than 300 airline, hotel, motel, and rental car operators experience AFVs firsthand, and many are considering them for their own fleets. Currently, LAX is scheduled to have 35% of its fleet running on alternative fuels by the end of this year, with the goal of a 50% alternative fuel fleet by the year 2003. LAX has demonstrated its early commitment to the AFV program by actively pursuing the use of AFVs since 1993. The airport's alternative fuel infrastructure consists of LNG, CNG, and electric refueling/charging stations. LAX operates 43 LNG transit buses, each able to transport 45 passengers. Six additional LNG buses have been ordered; delivery is expected in 2000. LAX's vehicle replacement program will continue to substitute diesel buses with LNG buses until the entire fleet of 52 is converted to natural gas, which is expected by the year 2001. CNG vehicles, including a street sweeper and recycling collection vehicle, are used primarily by the LAX daily maintenance crews in and around the airport. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) also has CNG dedicated and bifuel vehicles, which are used by airport police, airfield operations, landside operations, and other bureaus. LAX has ordered CNG sedans and pickups, and has gotten approval to purchase more CNG vehicles for fiscal year 19992000. LAWA has partnered with DWP to introduce 10 public electric vehicle charging stations, and 20 more are on the way.  And now you can rent an AFV... Planes are not the only vehicles taking off at airports in California. The popularity of alternative fuel rental cars is soaring. Budget EV Rental Cars offers EVs for rent at LAX, and has recently expanded its selection to include the dedicated CNG Honda Civic GX. The electric vehicles available include the Honda EV Plus, Ford Ranger, GM EV1, Toyota RAV-4, DaimlerChrysler EPIC minivan, and the Nissan Altra. Electric recharging stations are available to EV renters through a partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and natural gas vehicle renters receive fueling cards from Pickens Fuel and Southern California Gas Company that give them access to the many natural gas refueling stations in the Los Angeles area. Budget EV Rental Cars is also expanding its service locations. An EV Rental Center is now open at the Sacramento airport. The rental fleet includes 20 EVs, which are being offered for rental at rates as low as $44 per day, and charging is free at the 10 0 electric charging stations in the Sacramento area. With the support of Senators Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Congressman Ron Packard (R-CA), plans are underway to add additional centers at the airports in Burbank, Orange County, and Ontario.

Nan Miller, DFW Clean Cities  Sacramento, California In northern California, the capital city of Sacramento has actively reduced total air emissions by 15% since 1985, while doubling their passenger activities. Among the many partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies, Sacramento International Airport (SMF) has developed a comprehensive program to reduce air pollutant emissions from ground transportation sources. Sacramento County's Department of Airports has heavily invested in low emission AFVs and the associated fueling infrastructure. The airport fleet of CNG shuttle buses, trucks, and vans rely on a public access CNG refueling station built at the airport. SuperShuttle uses the CNG station every day to refuel its growing fleet of CNG-powered vans. In addition, special electric vehicle recharging stations have been installed in the parking lots. And finally, AFV rental vehicles are also available at the airport. In addition to alternative fuels, the Sacramento airport supports other efforts to reduce emissions from ground transportation by offering public transit, trip reduction, rideshare matches, incentive programs, and improved parking facilities.  American Airlines uses electric powered baggage tractors and belt loaders at DFW  approximately 200 gasoline-powered vehicles at the airport in the past year, and plans to replace another 100. According to Greg Rivera, Ground Equipment Specialist, ""American Airlines is committed to purchasing all electric baggage tractors and belt loaders."" In conjunction with state and regional officials, DFW is close to completing a study on the potential government uses for AFVs, which will show different ways for governments to blend their buying power and encourage research. The study should be completed this fall. Also, a new state plan developed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission will assess where emissions can be reduced, which may include airports. This study is expected out in early 2000.  Denver, Colorado Denver International Airport (DIA) in Colorado serves as an environmental model for other airports across the country. Among the many environmental initiatives the airport has undertaken to reduce pollution since it opened in 1995, one of the most exciting and visible is its AFV program. According to Terry Henry, DIA's Assistant Deputy Manager of Aviation for Fleet Maintenance, the airport and its tenants (including the airlines and concessionaires) have about 1,000 electric and natural gas vehicles in their combined fleet. The AFVs at the airport include baggage tractors, police sedans, pickup trucks, cargo and passenger vans, transit buses, and rental cars. Paul Nelson, Vice President of Natural Fuels Company, noted that the forklifts and enginelifts in the airplane hangars run on natural gas. ""Three-anda-half years ago [when the airport opened], there were fewer than 400 [natural gas] vehicles; now there are over 500. So in that time more than 100 [natural gas] vehicles have been added,"" explains Nelson, who has been involved with DIA's alternative fuels program since it began. Most of the AFVs at the airport run on natural gas. According to Nelson, the city and county of Denver (owner of the airport) has the largest natural gas vehicle (NGV) fleet with 220 vehicles. United Airlines, which uses DIA as a major hub, has 120 NGVs in their large alternative fuel fleet. To keep these DIA-based AFVs fueled and charged, the airport has eight natural gas refueling stations, several electric recharging facilities, and one liquefied-petroleum gas (LPG) station on the premises. Six of the natural gas stations are ""airside,"" meaning they are in a secure area for  Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas Dallas has taken big steps toward reducing air pollution emissions from the Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) airport. The DFW Airport Board has a long-term goal of converting 50% of its fleet to operate on alternative fuels. Efforts to support the Airport Board's commitment have been boosted by the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which is developing an implementation plan to incorporate alternative fuels at the airport. This process will entail surveying fleets near airport facilities, conducting cost evaluations, and creating public outreach materials. DFW has also adopted a policy requiring half of all taxis and shuttle service vans to run on clean-burning fuels within 5 years. Most of the funding for the new AFVs will come from a $632,000 state grant. Jim Crites, DFW Deputy Executive Director of Airport Operations, said ""the goals of DFW include plans to have 289 AFVs by 2005 and 344 by 2010."" In an attempt to meet these goals, the board recently agreed to purchase 54 CNG vehicles, which will include buses, alternative fuel police patrol sedans, and pickups. American Airlines, one of DFW's major tenants, committed $20 million for the purchase of more than 300 electric-powered baggage tractors and belt loaders for use in airside operations. To aid American's effort, DFW approved the installation of electric power recharging stations at airport gates. American Airlines has replaced  8   Denver International Airport  growing area with air quality concerns. Finally, the airport and community have demonstrated their strong commitment to energy efficiency and environmental programs, which includes an active alternative fuels industry. Future plans are expansive and include incorporating maximum energy efficiency into the new airport buildings and AFVs. GAI stakeholders conducted five working group meetings, which included participants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state agencies, Salt Lake City Mayor Corradini's office, the Airport Authority, the Olympic Committee, and others. The AFV working group was successful, in part due to Delta Airlines' interest in making the new airport capable of providing electric power to support charging facilities for electric airside vehicles. Other ideas that took shape include refinements to the existing state AFV incentive legislation, exploring AFV mandates for city-owned fleets, and concessionaire agreements with airport tenants to increase the use of AFVs. Potential advanced technology vehicles (ATVs) and AFV use at the airport may include:  Shuttle buses and transit vehicles  Baggage tractors and belt loaders  Rental cars  Refueling and recharging stations  Retrofitting existing engines. Many federal programs can indirectly support the GAI. For example, the Clean Cities Program often provides financial support to offset the capital costs of AFVs and their infrastructure. State and local governments can also play an important role in supporting the GAI through tax waivers, loan programs incentives, and more. Individuals can help, too. Programs are available to provide products at discounted rates in exchange for promotional opportunities; innovative financing--such as that from fueling companies that defrays capital investments through long-term fuel contracts--can be had; low interest loan programs are obtainable for community projects through local financial institutions.

Two natural gas refueling stations have been placed ""landside,"" meaning they are accessible by rental cars, passenger vans, transit buses, and the public. According to Denver 's Clean Cities Coordinator Deborah Kielian, ""Denver Clean Cities is looking to initiate the 'Clean Tents Program,' which will help provide information to airport passengers regarding the great strides that DIA is making with AFVs."" The Clean Tents name was created to reflect the architecture of the airport terminal. Denver has been a leader in the use of AFVs in airport fleets to combat air pollution for several years. The outlook is bright for DIA fleets to incorporate more AFVs. Nelson said that United Airlines just put 40 dedicated natural gas baggage tractors into service last summer, and added that ""the AFV effort at the airport is strongly supported by the airlines, the city of Denver, and the concessionaires, so it will continue to grow.""  Salt Lake City, Utah The ""Green Airport Initiative"" (GAI) is well under way at the Salt Lake International Airport (SLA). Earlier this year, the Clean Airport Partnership, the Salt Lake City Clean Cities Coalition, and the Airport Authority met to strategize on expanding the use of AFVs at the airport. They discussed many opportunities for illustrating how innovative technology, energy efficient design and planning, and alternative fuels can work together to breed smart growth and development, and the GAI was born. Why is Salt Lake City the ideal place to implement the GAI? With the 2002 Winter Olympics approaching, the eyes of the world will be on Salt Lake, giving the city and the airport maximum exposure. Salt Lake City is also a fast  Clean Cities Program Awards Rebates to Coalition Stakeholders Over the past two years, the Clean Cities Program has targeted efforts toward ""Advancing the AFV Choice,"" or making it easier for fleets across the country to choose alternative fuels. The strategy behind Advancing the AFV Choice includes computer-based tools, such as the AFV Fleet Buyer 's Guide and Preferred Fleets Database. Another critical piece of the strategy is the AFV rebate program, which helps offset the incremental cost of coalition stakeholder AFV purchases. Last spring, many Clean Cities coalitions submitted proposals requesting funds to help support stakeholder vehicle purchases--to facilitate their ""AFV Choice."" The rebates were recently awarded and have since contributed to the purchase of more than 530 AFVs in Clean Cities across the country. In addition, many coalitions that received rebate funds integrated the money into their own established rebate programs. They plan to offer their stakeholder fleets rebates to buy down the cost of their AFVs with these funds. A second round of rebate funding is anticipated to be available by the end of calendar year 1999. Stay tuned to AFN for details.  9   Federal News Clinton Clears the Way for Biomass On August 12, 1999, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13134 that will help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil, improve air quality, and meet environmental challenges such as global warming. This comprehensive national strategy aims to triple the use of biomass products by 2010. The order, ""Developing and Promoting Biobased Products and Bioenergy,"" will expand the production of clean fuels--such as ethanol-- as well as other bioenergy products. According to the White House press release, bioenergy and bioproducts can dramatically reduce global warming ""by reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100 million tonsthe What exactly is a equivalent of taking more than biobased product? 70 million cars off the road.""

Order discusses the ""potential to expand the use of biobased products and bioenergy by federal agencies,"" which includes the use of biofuels in federal vehicles. The order specifies that federal efforts must be coordinated to speed the development of 21st century biobased industries that use trees, crops, agricultural, and forestry wastes to make fuels, chemicals, and electricity. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, along with other agencies, are directed to prepare a report within 120 days from issuance of the order that contains options for modifying existing agency programs to promote the order. Many factors should be considered, such as the impact of greenhouse gases, biobased products manufactured from fossil fuels, and emissions of criteria pollutants of biobased products. The report will describe outreach efforts to raise the nation's awareness of the useful applications, benefits, and costs of producing biobased products. Federal leadership is required to aid in the progress of these technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace. The new ""research management team,"" as referred by the White House, will focus on the following goals:  Establishing the Interagency Council on Biobased Products to develop a detailed biomass research program to be presented annually as part of the federal budget;  Directing the Council to review major agency regulations, incentives, and programs to ensure that they effectively promote the use of bioproducts and bioenergy; and  Creating an outside Advisory Committee on Biobased Products and Bioenergy with representatives from biobased industries, farm and forestry sectors, universities, and environmental groups. Following the President's Executive Order on bioenergy, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson announced more than $13 million in funds will be dedicated to promoting the development of the biomass industry. DOE will fund 18 projects to further the development of technologies that can reduce the cost of using biomass to create new energy, fuels, and products. How can this new national strategy be implemented most effectively? The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's John Sheehan presented his views to the Environmental Vehicle Conference last June.

For more information on the Executive Order, visit the White House Web site at http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/retrieve-documents.html  Federal Fleet Concentrates AFVs in Selected Cities Why are the operators of many federal fleet vehicles that are built to use alternative fuels (flex-fuel or bi-fuel vehicles) opting to use conventional fuels instead? To all those frustrated with this situation, rest assured that federal operators will soon be filling tanks with alternative fuels, at least in six major metropolitan areas. In a proactive step to address the issue of low alternative fuel use in federal fleets, an interagency task force, led by the Department of Energy (DOE) and General Services Administration (GSA), has developed the Federal AFV USER Program (USER is actually an acronym that stands for Utilization Supporting Expansion of Refueling--try that in your next trivia game!). The USER Program's goal is to support the expansion of the alternative fuel infrastructure by concentrating large quantities of federal AFVs--and substantially increasing their use of alternative fuel--in six selected cities. All AFVs purchased through the program are required to operate on alternative fuel. By focusing efforts to build the federal AFV fleet in specific areas, the government encourages market development by increasing local alternative fuel station throughput and building a foundation for confident investments in additional refueling infrastructure  10   development. The cities were selected according to specific criteria, including the number of leased GSA and U.S. Postal Service vehicles in the area, as well as the level of support and demonstrated commitment to AFV use from local GSA representatives, federal fleets, automobile manufacturers, and alternative fuel providers. The selected cities were announced at the program's national kick-off meeting held during the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in May 1999 (see box for cities).

However, the money is not intended to cover the entire incremental cost of the vehicles; local fleets must contribute as well, as part of their demonstrated commitexclude other cities or restrict those with federal fleets interested in acquiring AFVs from doing so. ""We welcome and strongly encourage AFV use in all federal fleets operating in cities all across the country,"" said Slezak.

We expect the federal fleets to be leaders in the use of AFVs.""  Nuts and Bolts Have You Called the Clean Cities or Alternative Fuels Hotline Lately?

It preys upon the vulnerable in communities across the country. Suburban neighborhoods are no longer a safe haven, as it sweeps beyond city limits, wreaking havoc wherever it goes. It's not Godzilla...it's...it's...SMOGZILLA! Smogzilla is just one of the innovations developed by the Norwich Clean Cities Coalition to raise awareness of clean air issues in its community. ""We knew grade school kids would need something a little more active and engaging to help them understand the importance of AFVs,"" said Norwich Clean Cities Consultant Carol Butler. That's what prompted the coalition to work with the National Children's Theater to develop a play about pollution, AFVs, and clean ecosystems, featuring the big smog monster. Smogzilla stomped its way though elementary schools in the Norwich community, teaching children about air pollution issues and how alternative fuel vehicles, like the natural gas buses they ride to school every day, can help clean the air they breathe. Two versions of the play were developed: one for fourth through sixth grade students, and a modified, simpler version for kids in kindergarten through third grade. Both were a big hit with the students. ""The kids were enthralled...when it came time for audience participation, every hand went up,"" said Butler. It was also a hit with the press, as the effort was highlighted in the local newspaper. The coalition followed up its Smogzilla tour by making books and videos about AFVs and clean air available to the schools' libraries. Stakeholders are now looking into ways to bring the Smogzilla play to schools across the state. The city of Norwich was designated the 32nd member of DOE's Clean Cities Program on November 21, 1994. Serving a community of just 35,000 people in southeastern Connecticut, the coalition is one of the smallest in the country, but, despite its size, it has taken big steps to promote alternative fuels and AFVs. ""The progress the coalition has made in advancing AFV technology throughout John Kubesh/PIX 04152 City of Norwich Dept. of Public Utilities  DOE's Mike Scarpino visits with Smogzilla after a performance at a Norwich elementary school  the community is amazing,"" said DOE's Mike Scarpino, Clean Cities Program Manager for the Boston Region. According to Norwich Clean Cities Coordinator, Peter Polubiatko of the Norwich Department of Public Utilities, it's all a matter of getting the community involved. The coalition holds monthly meetings, and stakeholders are given responsibilities for management and coordination of coalition activities, including public outreach and education. ""Their outreach program is the best in the region, hands down,"" said Scarpino. The coalition has worked closely with the Board of Education and the Norwich Public School System to take every opportunity to incorporate AFVs into school activities. Kids who pre-registered for kindergarten last spring were treated to a ride in a CNG school bus (a preview of the excitement to come on their first official day of school), and the Norwich Planetarium, the only school planetarium in the state, also featured an AFV presentation. Coalition stakeholders made presentations to the Parent Teacher Organizations of every school in the district. With the help of the fire chief, they held training sessions on AFVs and their safety for both parents and students throughout the entire school system to allay fears over the decision to purchase CNG buses for the school system's fleet. ""The educational component of our program is very important,"" said Polubiatko. ""Having the fire chief as our advocate for CNG vehicles really helped increase public acceptance,"" he said. And the fire chief stands behind his word. He not only promotes the safety of CNG vehicles, he also operates them in his fleet. In fact, in addition to the school district (see box below), the fire department, police department, and public works department all operate AFVs. According to Polubiatko, it's that kind of involvement that has been the key to Norwich Clean Cities success. ""My best advice  Not only has the Norwich school system been a centerpiece for the coalition's public education effort, it is the first and only school system in Connecticut to operate alternative fuel buses. The coalition was awarded a 1999 DOE State Energy Program (SEP) grant to help cover the cost of its most recent CNG bus purchase and to help support a vehicle prototype project in partnership with John Deere. Norwich Schools had wanted to convert its entire small bus fleet to CNG, but learned that the conversions were not consistent with Connecticut's Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) standards. In an attempt to tackle this problem head on, Norwich Clean Cities will be working with the local John Deere distributor and the DMV.  12   to coalitions in smaller cities is to keep all of the community involved,"" he said. ""It's all a matter of community inclusion and involvement."" Essential to that level of community involvement and the driving force behind the Norwich Clean Cities effort is the Norwich Department of Public Utilities (NDPU), which was chosen by the city to coordinate the coalition, and hosts its monthly meetings. NDPU provides natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer services to the city, and in addition to operating a fleet of natural gas and electric vehicles (the largest electric utility fleet in the state), owns and operates the only public CNG station in southeastern Connecticut. ""We're looking to add infrastructure,"" said  Polubiatko. The coalition plans to work with the state to help bring state fleet vehicles to Norwich, a move which Polubiatko thinks will help drive further infrastructure development. ""We work very closely with the state. State agencies have been a real asset to our program."" Looking ahead to its fifth anniversary and its renewal of the memorandum of understanding signed at its designation, the coalition plans to keep moving forward, maintaining the enthusiasm for AFVs. Strategic infrastructure development is a top priority, as are fleet recruitment and planning the coalition's Advancing the AFV Choice event. With all the AFV activity in Norwich, Smogzilla may soon be an endangered species.  From the Hill alternative fuel vehicles in high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.  Congress Still Working Hard for Alternative Fuels As predicted in the Alternative Fuel News, Vol. 3, No. 1, West Virginia's U.S. Senator John Rockefeller (D) officially introduced the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act (S1003). The bill was created to ""level the playing field,"" for the various alternative fuels, as well as between alternative and conventional fuel vehicles. According to Rockefeller, ""We can break this [chicken-and-egg] cycle by creating tax incentives that keep alternative fuels affordable and help develop the necessary infrastructure."" The bill allows for the full complement of alternative fuels to compete in the marketplace through limited federal tax incentives that would be available during the early, critical years of market development. Specifically, the legislation would:  Extend the current electric vehicle (EV) tax credit and increase the credit for advanced technology electric vehicles. The current EV tax credit is 10% of the vehicle purchase price, up to $4,000. This bill would extend the sunset date until 2010, and give an additional $5,000 credit to any EV that would meet 100-mile range requirements. This should encourage technological innovation for advanced batteries.  Give a tax deduction (not credit) for the cost of installation of alternative fueling stations, up to $30,000.  Offer a 50-cent a gasoline-gallon-equivalent tax credit to the sellers of clean burning alternative fuels used in alternative fuel vehicles, to help them compete with the price of traditional fuels. This would allow alternative fuels to become more economically favorable to the consumer. Clean burning alternative fuels include: compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and any liquid made of at least 85% methanol.  Provide states the authority to allow single occupant,  Rockefeller stated, ""Tax incentives have traditionally been very effective in developing new infrastructure, and encouraging consumers to try new things. While changing consumers' behavior is not easy, I am confident that if people begin to see that alternative fuels are available, they will soon begin to use them."" U.S. Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) introduced similar alternative fuel tax credit legislation (HR 2252). The bill is virtually identical to the Rockefeller legislation, except for the provision regarding alternative fuel vehicles in HOV lanes. Regarding the bill, Rep. Camp said, ""It improves air quality, and by increasing the use of alternative fuels, it decreases our reliance on foreign oil."" Currently, HR 2252 has 18 co-sponsors, which demonstrates support for alternative fuels tax measures. Also, it is expected that Senator John Chafee (R-RI) will introduce another alternative fuel tax credit bill shortly. This proposal will provide a seller 's fuel tax credit of 25 cents for each gasoline-gallon-equivalent of alternative fuel sold in non-attainment areas; and a purchaser 's vehicle tax credit to defray the incremental cost of an alternative fuel vehicle. The vehicle credit, which will apply to light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, is tiered; cleaner vehicles receive larger credits. During the Senate floor debate on the tax bill, a colloquy took place among Senators Chafee, Hatch (R-UT) and William Roth (R-DE). In the colloquy, Roth, Chairman of the Finance Committee, agreed to work with Senators Chafee and Hatch to include an alternative fuel tax credit measure in a future tax package. Prospects for a tax package in FY2000 are now dimming. Stay tuned for more information on the Chafee legislation and prospects for tax incentives next year.

DOE's Brian Castelli, Chief of Staff for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, joined Tucson Mayor George Miller in signing a coalition's Memorandum of Understanding, officially designating the coalition. Stakeholders currently operate more than 580 AFVs, including CNG, propane, and electric vehicles, and have committed to additional vehicle purchases over the next 4 years that will add nearly 1,000 AFVs to the road by 2003. The Tucson coalition is coordinated by the Pima Association of Governments, and serves Tucson, as well as Pima County. The coalition maintains a diversity of stakeholders: utilities; local and federal governments (including an Air Force base); universities; and several niche market fleets, which encompass a transit bus company and local landscaping group. #74  Northeast Ohio Northeast Ohio became the 74th member of the Clean Cities Program on Tuesday, September 14. DOE's David Leiter, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, made his debut as a designating official at the ceremony, which was held at the Great Lakes Science Center in downtown Cleveland. The Northeast Ohio Clean Cities Coalition serves the city of Cleveland and the surrounding area, including Cuyahoga, Lorain, Summit, Medina, Portage, Geauga, Lake, and Ashtabula counties. More than 1,400 AFVs already operate throughout Northeast Ohio, and Clean Cities stakeholders plan to have more than 1,700 on the road by the year 2004.

Alternative Fuels Turn Vogue The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) created an exhibition to examine a new generation of cars: alternative fuel vehicles. The intention of the exhibit ""Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century,"" is to survey the current generation of automobiles and outline different paths to the future. The exhibit illustrates the scope and direction of the  rethinking in automotive design, and notes that AFVs ""represent an important and growing aspect of the market that caters to a consumer who is more attentive to thrift, and thus more attracted to the improved economy of these vehicles."" The exhibit examines new power plants and fuels, such as electric and hybrid engines that allow for a more fuel-efficient car. The New Structures and New Materials covered by the exhibit include DaimlerChrysler 's MCC Smart and CCV, Audi's AL2, Ford's Ka, and BMW/Rover Group Mini concept car. The Power Plants displayed include the Fiat Multipia, GM EV1, Honda VV (now called the Insight), and Toyota Prius. A forum created on the Web site allows the public to  14   At the Pump Biodiesel ""B20"" Workshops Held Across the Country In the wake of recently passed Energy Policy Act (EPAct) legislation, a series of biodiesel workshops were held across the country to increase awareness of biodiesel as a transportation fuel. More specifically, the workshops were geared toward educating people about biodiesel and the new option of using biodiesel to fulfill AFV acquisition requirements under EPAct. ""The original goal of the workshop was to expand the public's awareness of biodiesel through education and outreach. After the [EPAct] legislation passed, the National Biodiesel Board and NREL [National Renewable Energy Laboratory] agreed to join resources to expand the scope and number of workshops,"" said Shaine Tyson, NREL's Biodiesel Project Manager. Sponsors of the workshops included the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), NREL, the National Biodiesel Board, and various local partnerships. The workshops took place in five cities across the country from May to September this year. The cities included Bloomington, Minnesota; College Park, Maryland; Diamond Bar, California; Warwick, Rhode Island; and Chicago, Illinois. ""The target audience included all the groups that potentially have an impact on a fleet's decision to use alternative fuels. That can include federal, state, and local fleet managers and administrators, air quality regulators, city managers, etc.,"" Tyson explained. The free workshops provided a wide array of information on biodiesel, such as characteristics and properties of the fuel, contracting and purchasing issues, and issues fleet managers should consider when evaluating it for their fleets. Tyson also noted that ""the workshops have expanded competition in the biodiesel market as well."" Cincinnati, Ohio transit bus powered by soy diesel  ""The workshops have been successful in airing issues regarding biodiesel. They have been a conduit for answering questions regarding biodiesel, which is important due to recent attention given to biodiesel blends regarding EPAct legislation,"" said Mike Voorhies, manager, Regional Biomass Energy Program, Department of Energy. The EPAct regulation that has renewed attention to biodiesel is the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Interim Final Rule issued by DOE in May. The Final Rule allows fleets required to purchase certain percentages of AFVs under EPAct to meet up to 50% of their acquisition requirements through the use of biodiesel blends, such as B20, in vehicles weighing 8,500 lbs. gross vehicle weight or greater. B20 is a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel. With the new option, a fleet can get credit for one AFV purchase by using 450 gallons of 100% biodiesel. Joe Jobe, Executive Director of the National Biodiesel Board, was very pleased with the turnout at the workshops. ""The feedback and response we received was great. We utilized survey forms to fine tune the workshops and make information more in-line with what the participants wanted."" Although sponsors would like to continue with more workshops, no more are scheduled at this time. To learn more about biodiesel, visit the National Biodiesel Board Web site at http://www.biodiesel.org. The Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule can be found on their Web site at http://www.biodiesel.org/fueluselang.htm  comment on various topics related to the vehicles, such as ""Would you change your big car (SUV) for one of the cars in the exhibition?"" The comments submitted via the interactive Web site will be forwarded to the auto manufacturers. According to the exhibit's assistant curator in the Department of Architecture and Design, Christopher Mount, ""The show is really about efficient, responsible automobiles being likeable, appealing, and charming in their own way. In a sense, a good design can be affordable."" This exhibit was the first automobile exhibition to be held in the Sculpture Garden since the landmark exhibition, Ten Automobiles, in 1952. An indoor gallery space with explanatory text and  computer terminals was also available for the public to view the Web site. The Web site was created especially for the exhibit, and allows the public to gain a better understanding of the complex technology behind the design of these automobiles. The site provides photos and automotive information, including vehicle dimensions, construction, speed, engine type, etc. Internet links are also provided to many different locations to find new power plants and fuels, new materials, new structures and designs, and federal government agencies (which, of course, includes DOE).

Stakeholders and partners in cities across the country have done much to ensure that alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are available and the refueling and maintenance infrastructure is in place to support AFV use. Coalition members continue to reach out to local fleets, providing information about alternative fuel options and facilitating the AFV choice. The growing number of fleets using AFVs fosters the continued development of alternative refueling infrastructure, such that in many cities, fleets can now make a relatively seamless transition to alternative fuels. Individual Clean Cities serve as centers of AFV activity, but what happens when business stretches beyond those ""City Limits"" signs? For many fleets, business is not limited to a particular city. Delivery service vehicles may have multiple stops in several cities within a region. Airports frequently service many metropolitan areas; shuttle customers need transportation to or from the airport to neighboring towns. So how does Clean Cities facilitate travel between various Clean Cities? Many coalitions now work together to identify those fleets that use the interstate highways, so they can seek funding for shared refueling infrastructure projects along routes and further develop corridor links. Using Clean Cities as hubs, clean corridors can be created by enabling interstate and regional AFV travel to use a shared alternative fuel infrastructure. Clean corridors permit fleets that serve multiple cities to purchase AFVs with confidence, knowing that fueling convenience and supply will not be a problem. One of the most successful corridors to date is the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC). Coordinated by Clean Cities consultants at Gladstein & Associates, the ICTC connects multiple Clean Cities in the West, including Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco in California; and Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. The ICTC focuses primarily on the commercial trucking industry, targeting heavy-duty truck fleets that use Interstate Highways 80, 5, 10, and 15, and CA-99, and promoting liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to diesel fuel. Over the past several years, the ICTC has been successful in offsetting the incremental costs for LNG trucks throughout the region and in developing a network of refueling stations along the highways that make up the corridor.  3   The ICTC has received considerable acclaim. When faced with the challenge of mitigating the environmental impacts of increased border traffic due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Texas General Land Office (GLO) looked to the ICTC as a model for clean corridor development. NAFTA relies heavily on trade routes between the United States and its neighbors, Mexico and Canada. These routes have dramatically increased the volume of traffic--particularly heavy-duty truck traffic--along the highways connecting the three countries. The increase of heavy-duty trucks has brought goods and also higher levels of emissions and air pollution. The GLO recognized the air quality impact NAFTA traffic was having on the state (which includes major border crossing points for trucks transporting goods to and from Mexico), and looked to alternative fuel use as a solution. The GLO began working with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Lone Star Energy's alternative fuels division, the U. S. Postal Service, local Clean Cities Coalitions, and the Environmental Protection Agency to identify opportunities to reduce emissions through the use of natural gas. Through this partnership, and working in conjunction with Gladstein & Associates, the International Clean Transportation Corridor-3 (ICTC-3) was born. ""The marriage of the Land Office corridor effort and the ICTC was a good one,"" said Elizabeth Munger, Director of the ICTC-3. ""We learned from the ICTC effort and took advantage of their experience."" The ICTC-3 serves all three countries (hence the name ICTC-3) and focuses specifically on the cities intersected by north-south routes I-35 and I-29, and eventually I-94 (see map). The long term goals for the corridor include linking I-35 with east-west route I-10, enabling AFV travel from Houston, Texas, to Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. Connections with I-40, and the cities of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are also in the long term plan. When this effort is finished, the new corridor will link the ICTC-3 with its ""sister"" corridor in the west, the ICTC. But for now, according to Munger, the primary objective of the ICTC-3 is education and outreach. ""We are facilitating a two-way exchange of information, so everyone involved knows what's going on in the cities along the corridor and can take advantage of the opportunities to work together,"" she said. The group, which includes Clean Cities coordinators and stakeholders from the Laredo, Houston, Alamo Area, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Omaha, Red River Valley, and Winnipeg coalitions, meets regularly to discuss their current projects and progress. Clean Cities members are currently focusing their corridor efforts to strengthen their locales as hubs for mediumand heavy-duty vehicles. They are partnering on refueling infrastructure development projects and working to identify target fleets along corridor routes. ""The Clean Cities Program is the backbone of this effort,"" said Munger. ""So far, in each of the participating cities, a well-developed infrastructure for light-duty vehicles is beginning, but  Manitoba  CANADA  Winnipeg  North Dakota 94 29  Grand Forks  South Dakota  Minnesota  Nebraska 29  Iowa  Kansas  35  Kansas City Missouri  Oklahoma  Tulsa Oklahoma City  Arkansas  35  Ft.

With ready access to major transportation routes, Monterrey is home to a large number of U.S.-operated plants, U.S. companies, and local companies, all of which depend on trucks to transport their goods. The purpose of the trade mission, which is sponsored by DOE, is to promote U.S. alternative fuel technologies to medium- and heavy-duty truck fleets. For more information, call Elizabeth Munger, Director, ICTC-3, at 512-447-3595, or e-mail her at elizabeth@gladstein.org. PDNCCC/PIX 06149  there hasn't been much of a concerted effort on the nonmandated vehicles. If we can strengthen the hubs, we can connect them with stations in between and build a corridor to support increased medium- and heavy-duty AFV traffic,"" she said. The corridor partnerships have sparked new ideas and facilitated progress in many corridor hubs. According to coordinator Benjamin Watson, the Kansas City Regional Clean Cities Coalition (KCRCCC) reaped great benefits from the information exchange among the corridor cities. ""Last year we replicated work that was done in Oklahoma and were successful in getting alternative fuels legislation in Kansas and Missouri. This year we will be replicating the Dallas rebate project,"" he said. The ICTC-3 also serves as the alternative fuels working group of North America's Superhighway Coalition (NASCO), an advocacy group promoting Interstate Highways 35, 29, and 94 as North America's International Trade Corridor. NASCO works to leverage funding to improve the highways and their infrastructure, and to add critical technologies along the corridor to facilitate trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Part of NASCO's mission is to mitigate the environmental impact of the increasing truck traffic along the highways as a result of NAFTA. In her role as director of the ICTC-3 and chair of the alternative fuels working group, Munger shares corridor project progress and success stories with NASCO. ""The most important thing we do is disperse information and help educate NASCO and the fleets that use the corridor, by showing them that alternative fuels are a real option, which provide both economic and environmental benefits,"" she said. As more partnerships develop among Clean Cities coalitions, the network of alternative fuel infrastructure will expand. Clean corridors are making regional AFV travel a reality, and under the leadership of members from the ICTC, ICTC-3, and other corridor efforts, a closely knit national AFV network is on the way. For more information on clean corridors, please call the Clean Cities Hotline at 1-800-CCITIES.  Trucks waiting in line at a U.S./Mexico border crossing.  The ICTC corridor family is an example of a handful of corridor efforts, each in a different stage of development. The Northeast Corridor runs along the East Coast, connecting Richmond, Virginia, with Boston, Massachusetts, along I-95. The I-79 Corridor connects Charleston, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Clean Crossroads effort links several Midwestern Clean Cities, including Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana. The Colorado Front Range Corridor is another formalized effort among the Denver, Weld/Larimer/Rocky Mountain National Park, and Colorado Springs Clean Cities Coalitions, which is also working to connect with Clean Cities in Kansas and Missouri along I-70. The Northwest Corridor serves I-5, connecting the Rogue Valley Clean Cities Coalition in Oregon with the Puget Sound Coalition based in Seattle, Washington. It extends north into Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The I-90 Corridor links several New York Clean Cities Coalitions, including Western New York, Genesee Region, Central New York, and Capital District.  5   Federal News DOE Supports USPS Commitments to Electric Vehicles The United States Postal Service (USPS) recently ordered 500 electric delivery vehicles--the single largest purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) in U. S. history. Purchased through a competitive bid process from the Ford Motor Company, production will begin this fall. The vehicles will be assembled in Rome, New York. California will receive 480 of the vehicles, and the remainder will be located in Maryland. ""The acquisition of these new vehicles once again reminds us of the pioneering role the Postal Service has played for over 200 years, utilizing innovation and technology in binding the nation together. Adopting this world-class technology benefits the Postal Service and the American people,"" said Postmaster General William J. Henderson. ""We deliver clean air along with the nation's mail. We're proud to be a good, environmental neighbor in every community we serve.""  USPS Long Life Vehicle on display at the Clean Cities Conference in Louisville, Kentucky.  acid battery-powered EVs can be driven between 50 and 80 pollution-free miles before recharging. Acceleration is similar to their gasoline-powered counterparts, with the ability to go from 0-50 mph in 12.5 seconds. The deployment of the first 500 vehicles will mean an annual reduction in tailpipe emissions of nearly 143,000 pounds of carbon monoxide, 11,000 pounds of hydrocarbons, and 16,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides. Since these vehicles run virtually pollution-free, the 500 vehicles, with an average of 500 deliveries per route, add up to more than a quarter million of pollution-free deliveries per day. The USPS currently has the nation's largest compressed natural gas delivery fleet, with more than 7,500 vehicles. It recently purchased more than 21,000 flexible-fuel vehicles, which run on either gasoline or ethanol. By 2002, the USPS fleet of AFVs is expected to exceed 30,000. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson offered his congratulations to the Postal Service, saying the acquisition is ""... a watershed for the use of electric vehicles in the United States.""  . . .these vehicles cost the USPS no more than the gasoline vehicles the USPS normally employs. Thanks to partnering efforts with the U. S. Department of Energy, the states of California and New York, the California Energy Commission, and several other environmental groups, these vehicles cost the USPS no more than the gasoline vehicles the USPS normally employs. The lead  GAO Releases ""Glass Half-empty"" Transit Bus Report In December 1999, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the status of alternative fuel use in transit bus fleets across the country. The report, which was mandated by the Transportation Equity Act of 1998 (TEA), was to review the types of alternative fuel bus technologies now in service and discuss the environmental and economic implications of their use. A casual reader of the GAO report would conclude that alternative fuel buses are costly and not worth the effort. This is looking at the glass as ""half empty."" The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and many transit agencies look at the same data in a more positive light. With many of the early technical problems now solved, natural gas and other alternative fuel buses have a promising future.  6  John Nation/PIX 07873   The report contains some useful information and data within its charts and appendices; however, most of the discussion material is loosely based on informal conversations and interviews that the GAO had with a small industry group. Staff from only 12 transit agencies (out of hundreds in the country) were interviewed, and some of those agencies had only a few alternative fuel buses in their fleet (see table below). The GAO cited no specific scientific studies or in-depth analyses as the basis of the report, saying only that they had reviewed information from a variety of sources. Not surprisingly, the report reveals that natural gas buses make up the majority of alternative fuel buses now in operation. Despite extensive communication with DOE and other industry groups, the report discloses little recent information. It also fails to address several critical issues that now drive the increased demand for alternative fuel buses. Much of the report dwells on poor fleet experiences with early generation equipment from the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the findings do not reflect current market conditions. Despite the ""glass half empty"" write up, an overview of the report's charts and appendices does show some positive alternative fuel trends that were not revealed in the GAO findings (see box at right). Most of the people interviewed for this report believe that environmental concerns are the main reason more alternative fuel buses are being used; the report states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ""receives  more complaints from the public about emissions from transit buses than all other environmental issues combined."" Furthermore, the report claims that diesel buses have become significantly cleaner over the past 11 years, based on progressive tightening of emissions standards over that same period.  Alternative Fuel Trends  The number of new alternative fuel transit buses being purchased by agencies across the country continues to grow. Nearly 20% of all new bus orders are now alternative fuel vehicles (primarily natural gas).  Half of all the agencies contacted by the GAO plan to continue buying alternative fuel buses; of those, all but one are buying 100% alternative fuel buses (i.e., not ordering any diesel buses).  Half of the CNG transit operators that were interviewed reported their fuel costs for CNG were equal to or less than their diesel costs would have been for the same period. (Note that this was before the steady price increases that diesel and gasoline are experiencing.) No mention was made of the anticipated price increases for low-sulfur diesel fuel necessary to achieve future emissions reductions in diesel engines.

The subsequent consent decree settlement (more than a billion dollars) clearly demonstrates that the engines on the road did not meet the published standards. According to an EPA spokesperson, ""The seven companies sold 1.3 million heavy-duty diesel engines containing illegal `defeat devices,' which allow an engine to pass the EPA emissions test, but then turn off emission controls during highway driving. As a result, these engines emit up to three times the current (allowable) level for NOx, a harmful air pollutant."" These heavy-duty diesel engines emitted 1.3 million tons of excess NOx in 1998 alone, equivalent to the NOx emissions from an additional 65 million cars being on the road, and representing 6% of the total NOx emissions across the nation.  In addition, the report makes no mention of numerous recent studies and scientific findings concerning the health effects of exposure to diesel particulate matter. Such exposure is often worse in communities that rely heavily on public transit. Nor does the report address the impact that new regulations currently under consideration in California could have on the demand for alternative fuel buses. On the capital expenditure side, there is no question that alternative fuel buses continue to carry a premium. However, based on the large number of new orders for natural gas buses, many transit agencies and their local communities apparently believe that the added expense is justified by the environmental and societal benefits that the alternative fuel buses offer. Check out www.afdc.doe.gov/afv/buses.html for the latest documentation on alternative fuel buses.  DOE Makes Progress with State and Fuel Provider Enforcement The State and Fuel Provider (S&FP) regulation went into effect in April 1996 (effective with the 1997 reporting year), in accordance with the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Under this program, which is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), state fleets and alternative fuel provider fleets are mandated to acquire a specific percentage of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as part of their regular annual light-duty vehicle acquisitions. The S&FP Program requires fleets to report on the number of light-duty vehicle and AFV acquisitions for the year. Fleets earn credits for AFVs acquired in excess of their requirements, which can then be traded or sold to other fleets that were unable to meet their requirements through AFV purchases. This process provides key flexibility in the program and promotes both AFVs and sound business practices. For model year between 50% and tions are required depending on the 2000, which began September 1, 1999, 90% of new light-duty vehicle acquisito be AFVs (the percentages vary type of fleet). EPAct that do not comply with the S&FP regulation are subject to fines violation per day. As of January 2000, fleets had complied.  Pictured in front of the Minnesota State Capitol Building are Wally Lysle and Jan Reak with a Ford Taurus FFV, part of a fleet used by the Minnesota Department of Public Service.  Fleets covered by requirements of the of up to $50,000 per almost 90% of these  from sedans and pickup trucks, to vans and minivans. Furthermore, due in part to this program, more refueling sites are available nationwide for fuels such as ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These options provide AFV users more flexibility and freedom. For example, ethanol stations have increased from two nationwide in 1992 to 49 in 1999. The network of CNG stations has grown from 349 to 1,267, and LPG refueling stations have increased from 3,297 to 4,153 over the same period. Since the regulation passed, DOE's program team has spent most of its time organizing the implementation. Now that procedures and processes are in place, it will focus on increased outreach and enforcement. For more information regarding the S&FP Program, log on to the Alternative Fuel Data Center Web site at www.afdc.doe.gov/fleet.html, call the regulatory information line at 202-586-9171, or send an e-mail to regulatory_info@afdc.nrel.gov.  Fleets reporting to DOE now have more than 35,000 AFVs on the road, with annual demand of at least 6,500 AFVs. Dana O'Hara, DOE's EPAct Team Leader, has high hopes for the program. ""We expect the number of AFVs in state and fuel provider fleets to keep increasing, in part because our enforcement strategy is flexible and fair,"" he said. Today more than 30 different models of AFVs are available from original equipment manufacturers, ranging  8  Warren Gretz, NREL/PIX 05039   Focus On Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  AFN Focus on the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  SLCCC has niche market projects (including several 100% alternative fuel fleets), airport initiatives, a technical training program, a renowned legislative effort, and a recognized public outreach program. The coalition recently received non-profit status. How do they do it all? Miller says it's a combination of the right environment and stakeholder support that helps make it happen in Salt Lake City. ""Ultimately, every Clean Cities coalition is concerned with increasing the number of AFVs on the road and adding more refueling infrastructure,"" she added. ""We are fortunate to have wonderful fleets and strong support from our stakeholders."" In addition to tactical project support, the Utah Office of Energy Services has made the full-time coordinator position possible through funding support, and the Salt Lake City Mayor 's office provides Miller with a workplace and other amenities, including a computer, phone, and mailing services. ""The availability of a full-time coordinator has been a vital element to their success,"" said DOE's Ernie Oakes, Clean Cities Program Manager for the Denver Region. Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition successes include more than 2,230 AFVs, already surpassing their original program plan goal for 2000. Many of these vehicles operate in niche market fleets that are highly visible to the community. The Newspaper Agency, responsible for delivering the area's two major newspapers--the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News--is a classic example of a successful niche market AFV fleet. According to Miller, after researching its options, The Newspaper Agency staff decided AFVs would be a good way to give something back to the community. Today it operates a nearly 100% alternative fuel  Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  Increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on the road and developing a network of refueling sites to support their use is no mean feat. It requires well-rounded coalitions that are effective in all aspects of the Clean Cities arena, including public outreach, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and legislative advocacy. Any of these tasks may seem formidable, but the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition (SLCCC) and coordinator Beverly Miller makes it all look easy.

All 230 of its vans, which travel six million miles a year, run on CNG and are saving the company thousands of dollars in fuel costs. ""The Newspaper Agency is absolutely committed,"" said Miller. ""It's their passion for alternative fuels that has made them so successful."" Another delivery fleet, Flower Patch, Inc., a floral delivery service, is also operating its entire fleet (18 vehicles) on natural gas. The Jordan School District added seven natural gas buses in 1999, bringing its total AFV fleet to almost 30. The city-owned airport, whose fleet includes many heavy-duty snow removal vehicles and buses, is 26% alternative fueled, and that percentage is steadily climbing. The coalition, which intends to make Salt Lake International Airport ""the greenest airport in the country,"" has developed an AFV strategic plan to be implemented this year. SLCCC is also working with independently owned shuttle companies that service the airport to facilitate their transition to alternative fuels. Among the stakeholders at the helm of SLCCC's niche market effort is a local vehicle dealership. A representative from Hinckley Dodge is working with several area shuttles that serve handicapped and disabled people to transition their vehicles to AFVs. ""It's been the most focused and  9   The thousands of AFVs traveling the area's roads would not be possible, however, without the strong support of fuel providers like Utah's Questar Gas. Miller calls Questar Gas ""simply fantastic."" Not only does its fleet include more than 800 AFVs, but the company has also helped develop an extensive refueling infrastructure network that includes more than 60 natural gas stations. In partnership with the state of Utah, most of the region's refueling sites are now publicly accessible with a common gas credit card. ""GasCard expanded the number of publicly accessible sites from 20 to 32,"" said Miller. ""The stations are easily accessible and near interstate highways, which helps create an environment attractive to fleets,"" she said.

Pictured (left to right, top): Beverly Miller, Ellen Stone, and Robin Erickson; (left to right, bottom): Gordon Larsen, John Bennett, Wendell Combs, Lynne Nichols, Jim Brande, Jim Jeffries, and Richard Valentine.  The coalition, which recently received non-profit status, also assists area fleets with fund-raising to support AFV purchases. Last year, SLCCC was awarded three DOE State Energy Program Special Projects grants totaling $314,421. The funds will support the school bus fleet, a delivery fleet, and a publicly accessible refueling station at the airport. The coalition also received $25,000 through DOE's Clean Cities Rebate Program to create an AFV reimbursement fund for coalition stakeholders. The Propane Education and Research Council also awarded the coalition a grant to support The Newspaper Agency's purchase. SLCCC is active in public outreach as well. The Newspaper Agency, which co-chairs the coalition's public awareness committee, helped develop several projects. In partnership with the National Energy Foundation, they created two newspaper supplements. The first insert was a resource guide with information on alternative fuels and Clean Cities for the elementary and middle school students participating in Utah's ninth annual energy debate. More than 375,000 copies were printed; half were distributed to schools in response to specific requests. The second newspaper insert corresponded to the opening of TRAX, the area's new light rail system, and featured information on alternative transportation systems, as well as the Clean Cities Program. The coalition is currently planning a third supplement on land use issues, which will highlight AFVs and transportation planning. Also included in Salt Lake's outreach activities is its technician-training program. The coalition developed a program that is offered without charge to technicians representing local entities with AFVs. It might seem the vehicle, station, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and public outreach activities would be enough to keep the Salt Lake coalition busy. However,  Miller and other stakeholders have also developed a legislative plan. ""I feel strongly about the importance of people directly involving themselves in the political process,"" said Miller. ""There isn't anything more American than calling your legislator and voicing your opinion."" The coalition has developed a relationship with local and national legislators and regularly informs them of its activities and successes. While in Washington, D.C., at the Fourth National Clean Cities Conference, Miller and several other SLCCC stakeholders made a trip to Capitol Hill and visited with staff members of every congressional representative for the state of Utah. ""It's important to work with the staff,"" said Miller. ""They can help you, or they can shut you out."" Perhaps it is no coincidence that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was a cosponsor of The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act (S. 1003), introduced in 1999, and has announced his support for alternative fuels in numerous forums. Utah legislators are also helping the SLCCC. As a result of the relationships SLCCC stakeholders have developed, staffers now seek their opinion. ""Voters don't typically make phone calls, but when you make yourself known, others will follow,"" Miller said. The coalition's legislative momentum will continue through the 2000 legislative session. Stakeholders have drafted AFV legislation they hope will be introduced. In the spirit of what Miller calls ""grassroots advocacy,"" several private sector coalition members are working with a lobbyist to help them with the information--and the courage--they need to call their elected officials and put in a good word. According to Miller, effective outreach and constant customer interaction help create a favorable environment for AFVs. ""If you do something long enough, if you have a constant presence and never forget your message, you'll begin to see some activity,"" she said. A strong core of support is also essential for success. ""I really believe this is a full-time job,"" said Miller. ""At the least, you have to get people involved. I am deeply indebted to about a halfdozen, results-oriented people. You don't need many, but with a core group you can really make things  10  Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  most aggressive effort I've ever seen,"" said Miller.   happen...just find two or three things that you can feel good about so you can advertise your success,"" she said. The SLCCC Board of Trustees meets regularly, as do most of the coalition's working groups. In addition to stakeholder involvement, remembering ""the basics"" is also critical to maintaining coalition support. ""It's also important to thank people,"" Miller added. ""You  have to bring people in, make them feel good about what they're doing, and let them know you appreciate their efforts."" Salt Lake Clean Cities continues to be a leader in all aspects of alternative fuel market development. Thank you, Beverly Miller and the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition, for setting an outstanding example.  Clean Cities Roundup Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition Celebrates Purchase of 40 AFVs Before kicking off its millennium festivities, the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition (GLICCC) hosted a different kind of celebration. Together with the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Boston Regional Office, coalition stakeholders, including KeySpan Energy, DOE's Clean Cities Program, Suffolk County, and Ford Motor Company, celebrated the purchase of 40 natural gas vehicles by Arrow Security, a private security firm based on Long Island. The purchase, recognized as the largest single acquisition of natural gas vehicles by a private fleet in New York state, was made possible by funding and technical assistance from the GLICCC, KeySpan Energy, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and the DOE Clean Cities Rebate program. GLICCC and KeySpan Energy leveraged $275,000 in public and private financing to help offset the capital costs of the project. For more information, call Mike Scarpino, U.S. DOE, Boston Regional Office, at 617-565-9716.

Connecticut Subway Restaurants Now Offer More than Just Sandwiches Now many Connecticut residents can do more than get a sandwich and chips at the local Subway. The Subway shops of Fairfield County have committed to a partnership with Clean Cities Energy Alternatives of Southwestern Connecticut (formerly Norwalk Clean Cities). Subway has positioned itself as the ""Smart Alternative,"" to fast food, a strategy that the company sees as a perfect fit with the local Clean Cities effort.  In the spirit of healthy living, Subway management has offered its locations as designated sign-up spots for individuals or companies. People who are interested in joining the local Clean Cities coalition can sign up while they lunch at a Fairfield County Subway shop, using coalition membership applications that are available at each cash register. In turn, Subway will have an ad on the application directing companies and /or individuals to the coalition's Web site www.pls.org/ccea.htm. Visitors to the Web site can download a coupon for Subway sandwiches, which is valid at a participating store in the Fairfield County area. Depending on the success of the pilot program, local board chairman James Hansen will present the idea to Subway's national board to implement nationwide.  11   From the Automakers Wieck Photo Database  Auto Show Attendees Get a Glimpse of Future Concept Cars Winter isn't only a season of cold weather, snow, and holiday fun. For many in the transportation industry, it's also the auto show season. In Tokyo and Detroit, automakers impressed audiences, who were anxious to catch a glimpse of the vehicles for the new millennium. Hybrid electric and fuel cell concept vehicles drew much of the attention, as environmentally friendly transportation is a growing concern among consumers. Ford and General Motors (GM) unveiled their hybrid vehicles developed with the help of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). The new energy efficient hybrids, still under development, boast fuel economies of 80, 90, and even 100 miles per gallon (mpg). Below are a few of the vehicles showcased last fall in Tokyo and at the North American International Auto Show held in January 2000. Although most are still concepts and do not compete directly with today's alternative fuel vehicles, these hybrid-electric and fuel cell technologies forecast an exciting future for drivers everywhere.  Ford Prodigy On the outside, the Ford Prodigy looks very similar to the conventional model year 2000 vehicles. What's on the inside, however, is a much different story. The Prodigy, a hybrid-electric concept vehicle designed to be a family sedan, uses a propulsion system with drive units on both axles. An experimental four-cylinder, 1.2 liter diesel engine, and an electric drive motor enable fuel economy of 80 mpg with diesel fuel (the equivalent of 70 mpg in a gasoline vehicle). Made almost entirely of aluminum, the Prodigy is extremely light and aerodynamic; rear-facing cameras replace traditional side view mirrors to reduce drag. But even though Ford uses the latest technology, it has not lost its focus on practicality. Unlike many other hybrid-electric concepts, the Prodigy has a usable trunk.  Honda Insight and FCX Honda's hybrid-electric Insight needed no introduction, as it was among the first hybrid vehicles to be officially unveiled last year (and it was also showcased at the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in June 1999). In addition to highlighting the Insight, Honda unveiled its latest advanced technology concept vehicle, the FCX, at the auto show in Detroit. The FCX is a fuel cell prototype sedan that Honda plans to have on the road by 2003. The prototype models include both hydrogen- and methanolbased systems.  Pictured top to bottom: Ford Prodigy, hybrid-electric concept vehicle; Honda Insight, hybrid-electric vehicle already in production; Honda FCX, fuel cell prototype vehicle.  12  Wieck Photo Database  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07324   GM's Precept and Chevrolet Triax Wieck Photo Database Wieck Photo Database Toyota Motor Sales  General Motors (GM) is also working on two new hybrid concepts--the GM Precept and the Chevrolet Triax. The Precept is among the world's most energy efficient vehicles; it can attain 90 miles per diesel gallon (80 mpg gasoline) equivalent. GM unveiled the sleek, aerodynamic hybrid-electric concept vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Precept features a dual-axle regenerative hybrid propulsion system that combines electric and either gasoline or diesel engine systems. The fuel cell version of the Precept also made its debut in Detroit. It uses a hydrogen hydride storage system, which GM boasts will attain 108-mpg equivalent and up to 500 miles in range. The Chevrolet Triax, featured at the Tokyo and North American International Auto Shows, is a sharply angled and highly versatile hybrid vehicle that can be produced with one of three powertrains--4WD electric, 2WD gasoline, or 4WD gasoline-electric hybrid. Customers will be able to select the type of powertrain that best meets their needs. In its hybrid form, the Triax has an electric motor that powers the front wheels and captures regenerative braking energy to recharge the battery. A gasoline engine drives the rear wheels, and a second electric motor captures the regenerative braking energy from the rear wheels and starts the engine.  Toyota's HV-M4 Although Toyota showcased its highly popular hybrid, the Prius, in Detroit, the company unveiled its newest hybrid concept vehicle--the HV-M4-- at the Tokyo Auto Show last fall. The HV-M4, the world's first hybrid-electric 4WD minivan, is powered by a 2.4 liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the back wheels. The HV-M4 is reported to meet Japan's soon-to-be toughest emissions standards, J-ULEV. With room for six and its own mobile power station (internal and external electric sockets that can power a microwave or television without extra charging), the HV-M4 will be an exciting entry into the hybrid world. Look for coverage of DaimlerChrysler's new hybrid, the Dodge ESX3, in upcoming issues of AFN.

These awards are the first for the Green Energy Parks Program. Thirty-three national parks will benefit from the grants, made possible through DOE funds. The money will support the enhanced use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in the National Park System. Anticipated projects include building new refueling stations, buying more AFVs, and evaluating emerging engine and fuel system technologies for use in the parks. The Green Energy Parks Program continues this year, with another round of project developments already under way. Check out www.doe.gov/news/releases99/decpr/ pr99319.htm for information about the types of AFVs and fuels being used in the National Park System.  NAFTC Names New Executive Director The National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) recently announced the appointment of Al Ebron as its new executive director. Ebron, formerly Alternative Fuels Program Manager for the state of North Carolina, brings extensive experience in alternative fuels to this position at NAFTC. The consortium, headquartered in Morgantown, West Virginia at West Virginia University, is the nation's leading supplier of alternative fuels systems training and education.

S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Technology Utilization has recently issued the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) Section 506 report. The report evaluates progress made in achieving the fuel displacement goals described in EPAct, the actual and potential role of replacement fuels and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in significantly reducing U.S. reliance on imported oil, and the actual and potential availability of various domestic replacement fuels and AFVs. The considerable experience gained from vehicle operation that was mandated by EPAct and related DOE research and development efforts helped determine the following conclusions about transportation replacement fuels:  The technical barriers to the use of alternative and replacement fuels can be overcome.  Many people who own vehicles find the performance of flexible and alternative fuel vehicles acceptable.  The 10/30 replacement fuel goals cannot be met, given today's petroleum product prices and the limited federal authority to promote or require the use of replacement fuels. DOE, as part of its EPAct rulemaking to determine if private and local fleets should be required to purchase AFVs, will determine whether the goals should be modified, given the current market conditions.  The public policy goals served by the increased use of alternative and replacement fuels remain strong in terms of reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil price shocks, decreasing emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing criteria pollutants, and promoting the development of the domestic economy.  It would be prudent for DOE and interested committees of Congress to begin discussions now on additional programs and authorities that would contribute to reaching EPAct goals. The report, entitled ""Replacement Fuel and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Technical and Policy Analysis,"" was finalized in April 2000 and transmitted to the President and Congress. Copies of the report can be viewed and printed from the ""Regulations and Legislative Activities"" section of DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies Web site at www.ott.doe.gov as soon as it is available. Printed copies will also be available by calling the Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1363.  On the Web Information about Alternatives The Natural Resources Defense Council recently launched a Web site intended to educate the public about alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Once educated, the council hopes more people will make the change to environmentally friendly cars. Visit the Web site www.nrdc.org/. The site www.edf.org/pubs/EDFLetter/1999/ Dec/h_green.html offers information about how to save money, energy, and clean air. This site is also linked through the government site www.fueleconomy.gov.  Ford's Envirodrive www.fordenvirodrive.com Ford Motor Company has a new Web site for its environmentally concerned customers. Unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show, www.fordenvirodrive.com offers the latest information on U.S. fuel economy, emission certification, and manufacturing plant environmental standards information, as well as a glossary of terms. The site also features ""E-labeling,"" which allows visitors to learn about the fuel economy, emissions, and recyclability of various Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury models.

It's an ambitious goal, but coalitions have a variety of new tools, services, and behind-the-scenes support mechanisms to help. Washington Day 2001 provided a forum for Clean Cities staff and industry partners to discuss strategies to achieve the three Clean Cities goals, as well as future plans. The strategies are grouped into five main program areas: 1. 2. 3. 4. Strong existing coalitions, Self-sustaining niche markets, Increased funding for AFV and infrastructure projects, Legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development, 5. Mandates and/or alternatives to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Of the five program areas, the first two offer greatest opportunities for influence by the Clean Cities Program. Success in the other three depends largely on legislative action, policy, and the hard work of Clean Cities' industry partners (see box, page 5). At Washington Day 2001, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey unveiled the program's new strategic plan, which outlines DOE's efforts to help strengthen coalitions and build self-sustaining niche markets.  Stronger Coalitions The desire for strong existing coalitions clearly extends from the Clean Cities goal to see 75% of coalitions ""self-sustaining by 2005."" According to the Clean Cities plan, one key to coalition strength is effective leadership from its coordinator. The coordinator is a person who is usually asked to wear many hats. Various roles can include facilitator, marketer, motivator, grant writer, organizer, researcher, liaison, mediator, public affairs specialist, manager, and fundraiser. Those responsibilities are difficult enough for any full-time person, but especially for a coordinator who works only part-time. Of the 80 Clean Cities coalitions nationwide, only about 15 percent have full-time coordinators. Another source of strength is a diverse base of stakeholders. Coalitions should seek the active involvement of fuel providers, local and state governments, private fleet operators, and auto dealers. Other potential participants might be metropolitan planning organizations, large corporations, public relations firms, nonprofit organizations, airport management, universities, and local fire departments. A thriving board of directors, composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds beyond alternative fuels, can make an enormous difference in building a sustainable coalition. Board members often donate money, actively promote the organization, and solicit funds on its behalf. Strong boards have members who tend to stay longer than one term and provide organizational continuity. They take an active part in setting goals and objectives and evaluating coalition progress. Clean Cities will offer new training workshops to educate state and local policymakers and incorporate as a non-profit organization. Additional strategies under the ""strong existing coalitions"" heading include building fleet  National Clean Cities Program Director Shelley Launey addresses the Washington Day audience.  T  he Clean Cities' vision of the future is one of strong, vibrant, self-sustaining coalitions and niche markets in which alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleets operate 100% of the time on alternative fuel. It's a vision that includes 1 million AFVs on the road, using 1 billion gasoline gallon equivalents of alternative fuel. It is also a vision that could become reality. At Clean Cities Washington Day 2001, program staff and industry partners unveiled the specific strategies designed to help local coalitions build a viable national alternative fuels market. The strategies presented at Washington Day 2001 are a result of stakeholder input at the first-ever Clean Cities Washington Day, held on March 15, 2000. At that meeting, Clean Cities Program staff announced three new long-term goals, designed to advance the most fundamental purpose behind Clean Cities--to promote AFVs and increase alternative fuel use:  1 million AFVs on the road (using alternative fuel) by 2010,  1 billion gallons of alternative fuel used in AFVs annually by 2010,  75% of Clean Cities coalitions self-sustaining by 2005. To reach these goals, each Clean Cities coalition must increase AFVs in its region by 17 percent annually, with an  4  Photodisc   Filling a Niche  Niche market fleets, which often travel contained routes and are fueled at a central location, Airport vehicles make up one niche market, along with offer an enormous opportunity for government, transit, and cargo/delivery fleets. The plan includes a host of alternative fuels. And highnew numerical data on fuel use mileage fleets can benefit from and the numbers of vehicles that comprise all four targeted considerable cost savings using alternative fuel. Clean niche markets (see table, page 6). Gathered from various Cities coalitions have already identified several potentially sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection successful niche markets, including airports, transit agenAgency, U.S. Census Bureau, trade publications, and studcies, cargo and delivery companies, and government fleets. ies by consulting firms, the information will be extremely Although a wide variety of vehicle types can comprise a useful for gauging market potential within individual single niche, those vehicles can share an infrastructure, which helps ensure the success and longevity of the market. coalition regions.  Washington Day 2001 Highlights the Latest AFV Market Strategies In addition to the Clean Cities strategic plan, Washington Day attendees learned about the activities that DOE's alternative fuel industry partners have initiated to address Clean Cities priorities and drive the program closer to its goals. Kateri Callahan of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas and Paul Kerkhoven of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition tackled legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development. They discussed recent events on Capitol Hill and reviewed potential upcoming legislation to encourage AFV and fuel-efficient vehicle purchases as well as alternative fuel infrastructure investments. For their presentations and more on possible legislation, check out the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml. To address increased funding for AFVs and infrastructure projects, Doug Howell of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute and Jake Plante of the Federal Aviation AdministraRuth Horton, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority; Greg tion (FAA) discussed Zilberfarb, Ford Motor Company; Amy Engel, two of the largest Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition grant programs availCoordinator able--DOT's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) grants and FAA's AIR 21 grants for airport projects. Coalitions must work closely with their local metropolitan planning organizations to ensure CMAQ funds are used to support alternative fuel projects, said Howell. An open-microphone ""mini-town hall meeting,"" held in the afternoon, prompted an informal dialogue among all participants about topics such as the state of the natural gas industry, public access vs. niche market infrastructure, upgrading aging fuel stations, alternative fuels used as blends, and administrative expenses in DOE State Energy Program grants. For more information on any of the topics discussed at Washington Day 2001, please call the Clean Cities Hotline at 800-CCITIES.  Michael Klinkner of East Bay Clean Cities talks with Carol Butler, Executive Director, National Clean Cities, Inc.  Warren Gretz, NREL/PIX 00091  customer prospects, developing markets for alternative fuels, grant writing, and using existing outreach services such as the Clean Cities Hotline. All are described in the plan. The Clean Cities Program will offer training workshops in some of these areas in all six DOE regions, in 2001-02.  In the Clean Cities strategic plan, the term ""self-sustaining niche markets"" implies economic interdependence in a given area. The prevalence of AFVs should help ensure local demand for trained technicians and a fueling infrastructure. The availability of those services, in turn, makes the purchase of AFVs more attractive. When it works, the market becomes economically self-sustaining, with little or no government involvement.  5   Clean Cities coalitions will probably recognize some of the specific niche market strategies contained in the plan. But these ""tried and true"" activities, such as Advancing the AFV Choice events, coupled with new tools and strategies will help ensure sustainable AFV niche markets. Other niche market development strategies include Tiger Teams, largescale project funding, and a renewed focus on fleets required to purchase AFVs by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Clean Cities Tiger Teams are teams of experts, assembled by DOE, to assist coalitions with technical problems. Their expertise includes vehicle operations issues such as performance, safety, technician training, and driver acceptance; and fueling infrastructure issues such as station design and siting, and working with fuel providers. Tiger Teams can also help evaluate potential market opportunities and determine project feasibility. Coalitions are expected to exhaust other resources before applying for Tiger Team assistance. More information is available at www. ccities.doe.gov/tiger.html. Coalitions are encouraged to pursue large-scale AFVrelated projects, with the support of certain public sources of funding. One source is the federal government's new AIR 21 Program, which will provide as much as $2 million each to 10 airports, for AFV projects. Another, larger source is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which has provided more than $270 million to more than 200 AFV projects since 1991. Working with EPAct-mandated fleets, such as federal and state governments, is not a new concept for Clean Cities. Federal agencies, however, must comply with a new executive order, signed last year, which requires federal fleets to use alternative fuel in their AFVs more than 50 percent of the time by 2005. And although EPAct does not require state fleets to actually use alternative fuel in their AFVs, many states have authorized alternative fuel  refueling policies or have taken the initiative to mandate alternative fuel refueling policies. As stated in the Clean Cities plan, these mandated fleets offer coalitions an opportunity to build a refueling infrastructure network in which stations are ensured significant throughput. And although local governments are not covered by EPAct mandates, as school buses are often an effective AFV application. The Clean Cities plan encourages coalitions to identify all government fleet operators, but especially those affected by federal legislation, and hold a niche-specific Advancing the AFV Choice event to help them choose vehicles and to develop a fueling infrastructure. Among the new tools to assist coalitions in obtaining funds is a national database of CMAQ-funded alternative fuel projects. With support from a DOE grant, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute is analyzing national trends and creating the database help Clean Cities coalitions determine how CMAQ funds are allocated. Current data is more difficult to use due to the different reporting styles of state and local governments. The Clean Cities plan also highlights the products and tools for cultivating niche markets, which resemble the ones available in the ""strong existing coalitions"" program area (described earlier). Educational workshops, for example, will offer training in specific niches, such as airports. Other new tools include educational software on alternative fuel school buses and a shuttle bus took kit for coalitions interested in airport shuttle projects. Communications resources such as fact sheets and case studies are also available in print and via the Clean Cities Web site, www. ccities.doe.gov. The Clean Cities strategic plan was distributed to all Washington Day 2001 participants and was mailed to coalition coordinators who were unable to attend. An electronic copy of the plan is posted on the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml.

But neither commodity--nor thousands of others--would be possible without long-haul trucks. Nationwide, about 480,000 long-haul, heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7 and 8) deliver goods from one place to another. Many travel hundreds of miles daily and frequently stop overnight. Sleeper cabs provide drivers with spacious and comfortable accommodations, but to keep the engine warm in the winter and maintain the cab's climate control conditions, most drivers leave the engine idling. According to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) estimates, the average truck sits idling for up to 1,800 hours each year--an equivalent of 75 straight days. Just one hour of idling burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year, ANL says. Idling reduces fuel economy and wears the engine, requiring operators to invest more in maintenance and repair. It also pollutes the air. ANL estimates that each year, long haul heavyduty trucks produce 10 million tons of carbon dioxide, about 60,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, and nearly 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide just by idling. only 10% to 15% of the fuel a diesel truck engine uses to heat the engine or run cab heating and air conditioning. They are commercially available, easy to install, efficient, and relatively inexpensive to operate.  Just one burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year.  By burning less fuel, cab comfort units dramatically reduce harmful emissions and, perhaps more important to cost-conscious drivers, they can save the average long-haul truck operator as much as $1,900 each year in fuel costs alone. Less time idling also means less wear on the engine, which enables operators to save on preventative maintehour of idling nance and repair costs as well. Despite the benefits, truck operators are still reluctant to pay the initial cost of cab comfort units, which are typically about $3,000. But ANL estimates that the significant fuel and maintenance savings will help operators see a return on their investment after just one year of use.  Truck operators must stay warm in the winter and cool during the summer, but now there is an alternative to idling. ""Anti-idling devices"" include direct-fired burners for cab and engine block heating; thermal storage devices for heating and cooling; and auxiliary power units for heating, cooling, and electrical power. These devices use  DOE has launched a program to promote the use of cab comfort units. The message: Don't Idle Your Profits Away! DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) created an exhibit booth to showcase cab comfort technology and communicate the anti-idling message to truck operators at truck shows. ""Some truck drivers think our efforts are designed to make them suffer in unheated or uncooled cabs,"" said OHVT's Sid Diamond. ""That is not at all our intent. Our goal is to show drivers that they really don't need a 600horsepower diesel engine to run their trucks' climate control units and appliances. Today there are a number of options that provide more energy efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solutions to control cab comfort and safety.""

FutureTruck Students Rise to the Challenge Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) have emerged as the most popular single vehicle class in the United States. But they generally use more fuel and produce greater exhaust emissions than passenger cars. They're big, and getting bigger, in terms of both popularity and physical size. There's no doubt that SUVs are here to stay. The challenge is to create an SUV that meets the needs of the future, with better fuel efficiency and lower emissions, while retaining the comfort and performance that consumers have grown to expect. Fifteen teams of university students are rising to meet the challenge through FutureTruck, a four-year competition sponsored by DOE and General Motors (GM). Through FutureTruck, university students are building the SUV of the future, using advanced technologies such as fuel cells, light-weight materials, innovative powertrain strategies, and alternative fuels. GM is supplying seed money, prize money, vehicles (Chevrolet Suburbans), and facilities for testing and evaluation. Ford Motor Company will become the automotive sponsor in 2002 and 2003. FutureTruck student teams compete in a series of performance events including acceleration, trailer tow performance, off-road handling, and on-road fuel economy; as well as static design events, such as consumer acceptability and engineering design. The vehicles are tested for full fuel cycle analysis, and each team must also prepare a written and oral technical presentation. Last year marked the start of the four-year FutureTruck competition. With less than five months to modify their vehicles, students managed to increase on-road fuel efficiency of their Chevrolet Suburbans by 13%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (compared to stock vehicles).

""It's inspiring,"" said Steve Gurski, team leader for Virginia Tech. ""In FutureTruck there's always a new challenge that no one has ever met before."" According to Gurski, undergraduate students and their team leaders spend as many as 30 hours per week on their vehicles. Team leaders--typically graduate students--spend even more time. They also help leverage funds and support for the project, write reports and waivers, and direct resources to help solve problems when necessary. Team leaders ensure that the team, and the vehicle, are ready for the June competition. For many students, FutureTruck is a life-changing experience. ""I got involved because of the toys, not realizing what a difference it would make in my career,"" said Michael Ogburn, last year 's team leader for Virginia Tech. ""Three years of playing with cars and trucks left me so aware of my passion to make a difference in the struggle to save the planet, that it makes my head spin to imagine doing anything else,"" he said. The FutureTruck 2001 competition will be held June 4-13. Events will be held at the GM Proving Ground in Milford, Mich. Teams will then travel to Washington D.C. for an awards ceremony and vehicle display on Capitol Hill.  Facilitating the Next Generation of Natural Gas Trucks The new Next Generation Natural Gas Vehicle (NGNGV) Program, sponsored by DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, will develop natural gas-powered trucks with significantly lowered exhaust emissions, for commercial development in the next several years. The NGNGV Program vision is to build one new medium-duty (Class 3-6) CNG truck, and one new heavy-duty (Class 7-8) LNG truck by 2004, using technologies to reduce emissions of particulate matter as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Typical NOx levels for today's low-emission natural gas trucks are in the range of 2-2.5 grams per brake-horsepower. The program has targeted NOx emissions of roughly one quarter of that level, at .5 grams. Specific technological advances may take the form of improved engine-combustion designs, new dual-fuel systems, and better catalytic treatment of exhaust. The program is expected to draw interest from original equipment manufacturers as well as suppliers of sensors, engine-control systems, and fuel-air delivery systems. Information is available from Kevin Walkowicz at 303-275-4492, or at www.ctts.nrel.gov/ngngv.  Virginia Tech engineering students have equipped their Suburban with hydrogen fuel cell power.

The vehicles began their journeys at various locations throughout the West and Midwest, traveling along major interstates and stopping at propane refueling stations along the way. At each stop, drivers gave out information about the road rally and propane vehicles, and had a chance to interact with the public. They also collected signatures from the people they met during the rally into a logbook. Rally drivers traveled a combined total of more than 4600 miles and passed through 11 states and Monterrey, Mexico. Approximately 27 government entities, associations, and companies worked together to make the road rally and propane conference a success. Sponsors included several Clean Cities coalitions, propane associations, propane distributors, and vehicle manufacturers. Ernie Oakes, the Regional Clean Cities Program Manager for the Department of Energy/Denver Regional Office applauded the venture and said, ""The rally showed local communities that the propane industry and automobile manufacturers Photos from Ferrellgas Inc., NREL/PIX 09938  RALLY are working together to bring a cleaner auto fuel to the general public for use in their everyday lives."" Participating in the event were representatives of both government and private industry, from Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, and Monterrey, Mexico. The rally was the first event of its kind featuring dedicated propane vehicles. On Monday, February 5, the rally participants arrived in Kansas City just in time for the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition. The conference featured displays from the major auto manufacturers, propane distributors, and propane associations. Lead vehicles from each leg of the rally were driven onto the conference floor, where they remained on display throughout the conference. The signatures that were collected at the road rally stops were also on display during the conference.  Below: Ivan Jacques of Salt Lake City refuels a Ford Excursion.

Twenty-five of the company's delivery vans (or 80% of its entire fleet) run on compressed natural gas (CNG). The vans refuel at local public stations, and owner Bruce McShan offers creative incentives to encourage drivers to fuel with CNG. McShan decided to start using CNG 10 years ago, and has enjoyed significant savings associated with CNG. Connie's Pizza, Chicago: Since 1997, Connie's Pizza has been delivering pizza throughout the Chicago area, using CNG vehicles. Of the company's 50 vehicles, 18 are CNG Chevy S-10 pickups. Connie's also owns slow-fill compreseducation, providing training in refueling and vehicle operations. Vehicles are refueled at the 600 Schwan's depots located across the country. According to Macht, the drivers have been pleased with vehicle performance. Because Schwan's truck operators are commissioned sales people, they have a higher stake in the vehicles. If their trucks don't function, drivers don't make money. As for expanding its AFV fleet, Macht said the company will first focus on larger urban, non-attainment areas.

From the Automakers  Hybrids are Big at Detroit's Auto Show Hybrid sport utility vehicles (SUVs) took to the stage at the North American International Auto Show, held in Detroit in January. With the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius already on the streets and interest in energy efficiency on the rise, several automakers used the auto show as a forum to showcase their upcoming plans to bring advanced technology vehicles to market. Ford Motor Company announced its plans for a hybrid Explorer, which will debut sometime after the Escape hybrid is introduced in 2003. Ford showcased the hybrid Escape at the Los Angeles International Auto Show a week before the show in Detroit. The Escape, expected to get 40 miles per gallon, will use an electric motor for propulsion and a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Explorer will use a six-cylinder engine with electric assist. Both models will feature integrated starter-generator technology that automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops, such as at a traffic light. The Explorer hybrid will also employ a regenerative braking system for its 42-volt battery used to provide an acceleration boost at start up. A smaller 12-volt battery will supplement power to run devices such as DaimlerChrysler PowerBox hybrid-electric concept SUV  lamps and radios. For more information, check out Ford's hybrid Web site: www.hybridford.com. Among the newest concepts DaimlerChrysler unveiled at the Detroit auto show was the Dodge PowerBox, a hybrid-electric SUV. Unlike other hybrid SUVs, the PowerBox combines a supercharged V-6 engine that uses compressed natural gas (CNG) and an electric motor to supplement power and increase efficiency. A large SUV, the PowerBox concept has room for eight passengers, comparable in size to the gasoline-powered Dodge Durango, but with 60% better fuel economy. And because it's pow-  12  DaimlerChrysler   ered primarily by CNG, the PowerBox runs cleaner, with near zero emissions. For more information, visit www. daimlerchrysler.com. Building on last year 's Precept hybrid concept vehicle, General Motors unveiled its new hybrid propulsion system, the ParadiGM, which the company will be able to apply to a variety of vehicles, from passenger sedans to SUVs and trucks to commercial vehicles. The ParadiGM system combines a conventional V-6 or an inline fourcylinder engine with two electric motors and a battery pack to provide increased efficiency. The first hybrid application will be a mid-size SUV with fuel economy 20% better than its conventionally powered counterparts. GM's hybrid SUV is expected to debut in 2004; the company announced that at least 7,000 vehicles will be produced in the first year. More hybrids may follow, depending on market demand.

An AT-PZEV gets distinct recognition and greater credits because it has a reduced ""full cycle"" emissions impact. ""Being the first to receive AT-PZEV status is nice for Honda and the near-zero emission Civic GX. It also proves the value of natural gas as a long-term alternative to gasoline,"" Ellis says. Approved in January, CARB's new ZEV rule will require the sale of an estimated 4,650 full-size model year 2003 electric cars in California, and a comparable number of other super-clean and advanced technology vehicles as well. The ZEV minimums will rise to about 22,000 vehicles in 2010, and 50,000 in 2018. The SULEV provision allows car manufacturers to receive partial credits with PZEVs, including AT-PZEVs such as the Civic GX.  Honda Civic GX receives California's AT-PZEV certification The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in late December granted American Honda Motor Company partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV) certification for its natural-gas-powered Civic GX. The rating came just weeks before the 2001 model car, described by the manufacturer as ""cleanest on earth,"" hit the U.S. market. The standard, which falls under the super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) provision of CARB's recently released ZEV mandate, requires vehicles to support 15year, 150,000 mile emission system durability. They must also have zero evaporative emissions. Under this stringent SULEV requirement, the Civic GX is now the first advanced-technology, partial-zero emission vehicle (ATPZEV) says Stephen Ellis, American Honda's Manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicles. DaimlerChrysler 4-passenger NEV  DaimlerChrysler Adds Neighborhood Electric Vehicles to Its Portfolio DaimlerChrysler announced its acquisition of Global Electric MotorCars (GEM), becoming the first major automaker to sell neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) in the United States. GEM, based in North Dakota, produces two- and fourpassenger NEVs that can be licensed for use on public roads. The vehicles recharge in about eight hours using 110-volt household alterative current. NEVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are well suited for niche applications including local governments, parking enforcement, university and business campuses, and planned communities. The city of Denver, for example, through its ""Take Charge"" program, provides three NEVs for city employees to use for business downtown. American Honda Motor Co., NREL/PIX 09965  ""DaimlerChrysler is excited about the emerging market of neighborhood electric vehicles and the opportunities that GEM affords,"" said Mike Clement, Director of Alternative Fuel Sales and Marketing.

The zoo uses two electric Ford Rangers and three electric ""trikes"" (bicycles with three wheels) to travel from building to building. The pickups are also used in daily grounds-keeping activities. The Tulsa Zoo is a division of Tulsa Parks, a member of the Tulsa Area Clean Cities Coalition. Triangle Clean Cities, which serves the Raleigh-DurhamChapel Hill region of North Carolina, was designated the 80th Clean Cities coalition on March 19. Because the event was within driving distance from Washington, DC, several members of DOE's Clean Cities team showed their support for the coalition and for AFVs by driving the more than 250 miles to North Carolina in a natural gas vehicle and a propane vehicle. The Triangle Clean Cities Coalition's designation celebration, held at North Carolina State University, was part of an event staged to help advance fuel choices in the area. With flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) making up a majority of the region's more than 1,700 vehicles, the coalition remains active in promoting the increased use of E85. Last year, then-Governor Jim Hunt issued a proclamation announcing his support for the Triangle Clean Cities effort and mandating E85 use in state fleets whenever possible.  Birmingham Boasts Natural Gas Buses The Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) has joined a growing number of transit agencies across the country in a commitment to use compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. The BJCTA is 57% alternativefueled; of its 77 buses, 43 use CNG. According to Mark Bond, Director of Fleet Operations for City Transit (a BJCTA contractor), drivers are particularly pleased with the new buses' power and acceleration. Each of the CNG buses is clearly marked as a clean fuel vehicle, to help inform Birmingham residents of their transportation choices. The city of Birmingham is working towards a Clean Cities designation.  Photodisc  Oklahoma Utility Nears 100% Alternative Fuel Use Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) is closing in on 100% alternative fuel use. Of the utility's 1,120 vehicles, more than 800 (or 71.4%) run on natural gas. According to ONG's John Siska, last year the fleet used approximately 500,000 gallons of natural gas, and it plans to use more. ""Our goal is to reach 100% of our fleet,"" said Siska. ""Any vehicle that can possibly be converted and is close to refueling will either be converted or replaced with an original equipment vehicle,"" he said. Last year, Natural Gas Fuels ranked ONG third on its list of the top utility natural gas fleets, and the utility tied for first in alternative fuel vehicle projections. ONG is an active member of the Clean Cities coalitions of central Oklahoma and the Tulsa area.

The Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition (TC4) will become the 81st member of the program on May 31, 2001. The TC4, in conjunction with the Minnesota E85 team, has been successful in building an alternative fuel infrastructure network, and last year celebrated the opening of the region's 50th publicly accessible E85 station. With its partners, the TC4 has also initiated a large-scale educational and outreach effort to promote E85 use by the public, and has set specific fuel use and fuel sales goals to help target its efforts. The Vermont Clean Vehicles Coalition is planning a designation ceremony for this summer. The coalition serves one of the most rural Clean Cities regions of the country. It has promoted alternative fuels for several years, and has received significant media attention for having placed AFVs in fleets throughout the state. The coalition is also unique in terms of active participation by government leaders, including both of Vermont's U.S. Senators, its congressional representative, and its governor.  Three New Coalitions Join Clean Cities Program By summer 2001, more than 80 coalitions will be part of the Clean Cities network. Each new coalition is the first in its state to join the Clean Cities Program.  14  John Farley, NREL/PIX 09972   Federal News DOE Names Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Project Recipients DOE's Federal AFV USER Program recently awarded funds for three separate projects, designed to increase the availability of alternative fuels such as E85 and compressed natural gas (CNG). The successful entries were chosen from proposals submitted in response to a solicitation in June 2000. The Federal AFV USER Program supports the expansion of alternative fuel infrastructure by encouraging the placement and use of federally owned AFVs in six specific cities: San Francisco; Denver; Albuquerque; MinneapolisSt. Paul; Salt Lake City; and Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. Roughly $266,000 in federal funding was awarded for the three projects, which have a combined total value of $812,000 including the cost share contributed by non-federal partners. Each partner 's contribution was at least 50%. Generally, the projects will support fleet managers and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) buyers. They include:  The Twin Cities AFV USER project, ""Using the Federal Fleet to Model the E85 Way,"" a customer education and marketing project that promotes the use of E85 fuel, $214,000;  Pinnacle CNG Co.'s DOE/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) CNG Refueling Station, for the installation and operation of a CNG fueling station at LLNL, $465,000; and  The Technological Research and Development Authority's deployment of ethanol fuel infrastructure for federal fleets in Melbourne-Titusville, for the installation and operation of an E85 fueling station at the Kennedy Space Center, $184,000. Because federal fleets are required by Executive Order 13149 to reduce petroleum consumption, DOE is targeting infrastructure and promotion projects to benefit them. Although the primary intent of the projects is to support the federal fleet, they were also evaluated by their potential to provide alternative fuel to state and local government fleets, commercial fleets, and the public.

Formed to help coalitions reduce the cost of AFVs, the program offers rebates of $2,000 per vehicle to coalition stakeholders who purchase AFVs. Under the terms of the deal, the funding must be used to buy dedicated original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alternative fuel vehicles. For more information, contact your Department of Energy (DOE) Regional Clean Cities manager.  Fleet Buyer's Guide Adds Electric Bikes, Hybrids, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles Electric bikes, hybrid cars, and neighborhood electric vehicles were recently added to DOE's Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer 's Guide. The site walks fleet managers through a step-by-step process that helps them identify whether Energy Policy Act (EPAct) regulations apply to them, and, if so, helps them make informed alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase decisions. Although electric bikes, HEVs, and neighborhood electric vehicles don't qualify for EPAct credit, they were added to the Web site because many fleets are interested in purchasing them. Currently the Buyer 's Guide has specifications and information on two HEVs, eight neighborhood electric vehicles, and more than a dozen electric bikes. Although the site was developed to assist fleets, the public is welcome to use it. Visit www.fleets.doe.gov, and click on the link for Advanced Technology Vehicles.  Where in the World are Alternative Fuels? The redesigned Clean Cities International Web site answers that and many other questions about Clean Cities around the world. The site, which features a special section in Spanish, is packed with detailed information about the program, the countries and cities involved, new publications, upcoming international events, and much more. Modeled after DOE's Clean Cities Program, Clean Cities International works with governments, non-governmental organizations, and the U.S. alternative fuel industry to help establish foundations for viable alternative fuel markets in other interested countries.

Building on the hybrid technology developed for the Insight, the new sedan features an improved version of the Honda Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) System, which enables the vehicle to achieve an ultra-high fuel economy of 29.5km/L. Environmentally friendly, this Civic hybrid sedan has been certified as an Ultra Low-Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. Details on the release of the hybrid Civic sedan in the United States are still pending.  Full Story .    Toyota Announces Sale of RAV4-EV to California Retail Customers  Beginning in February 2002, California retail customers will be able to purchase Toyota's zero-emissions RAV4 electric vehicle (EV) at local car dealerships. This zero-emission version of Toyota's popular compact sport utility vehicle is powered by a rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery and permanent magnet motor that enables it to travel up to 78 mph with a maximum range of 80 to 100 miles per charge. It will be the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electric vehicle to be sold to retail customers.      The decision to sell the RAV4-EV to the general public in California resulted from the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2001 passage of the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate. This legislation requires 10% of all new vehicle sold in the state to meet low emissions standards and 2% of the new vehicle purchases to be zero emission cars.      Toyota began leasing the RAV4-EV to select corporations and utilities in 1997. Today, there are approximately 900 electric RAV4s in service nationwide, including 700 on California roads. The RAV4-EV will have a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $42,000 but a $9,000 CARB incentive and $3,000 IRS credit should bring the price of the vehicle and in-home charging device down to about $31,000.

Ford and Toyota Engage in Talks to Produce Joint Hybrid Vehicle  America's Ford Motor Company and Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation are discussing plans to develop a new hybrid electric gasoline vehicle that would be produced in North America. Both companies would benefit from the increased economies of scale that joint production would bring, because developing hybrid technology is extremely expensive. For example, Toyota began producing the hybrid-electric Prius subcompact in June of 2000, but continues to loose money on the sale of these vehicles despite record demand for them.     Both companies share a commitment to increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. Ford is a key industry participant in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and has pledged to improve the fuel economy of its sport-utility vehicles up to 25% by 2005. Toyota's experience developing fuel-efficient hybrid technology for the Prius could help Ford to achieve this goal.    Talks between Toyota and Ford started in July of 2000 when former chief executive, Jacques Nasser met with Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. Dialog continues between the two companies with William Clay Ford Jr. now at the helm of the American automobile manufacturer. Both companies hope to clinch a deal on the joint hybrid-electric venture by the end of the year.        November 2001     Hyundai Fuel Cell Vehicle Wins Gold at Michelin Challenge Bibendum   The Hyundai Santa Fe fuel cell-powered sport utility vehicle took home two gold medals and two silver medals at the 2001  Michelin Challenge Bibendum  held at the California Speedway in Fontana, California on October 26th -29th. This four-day event has traditionally been an excellent opportunity for motor vehicle manufacturers to showcase the performance of near-term and long-range environmentally innovative automobiles and demonstrate their compatibility with driving performance, comfort, and safety. Competing automobiles were judged in nine individual categories including design, acceleration, braking, handling, slalom, fuel economy, range, noise level, and emissions. Participating as a member of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership , the Santa Fe fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) faired extremely well in its first North American vehicle competition, earning gold medals in the emissions and noise tests and silver medals in the slalom and fuel efficiency trials. A total of six hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles from various manufacturers were entered in the competition.           GM Announces Production of Full-Size Ethanol Pickups   To meet the increasing U.S. demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), General Motors (GM) announced it would begin production of a full-sized flex-fuel pickup truck that can run on E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), regular gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels. The flex-fuel option will now be available on 1,500 series Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks that have 5,300 Vortec engines. The new pickups will increase GM's existing line of ethanol vehicles, which includes sport-utility vehicles such as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, and Chevy Suburban, as well as smaller pickups like the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma. For more information, visit  GM's Alternative Fuels  Web site.       OTT Releases 2002 Quality Metrics Report    Interested in how light- and heavy-duty alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicle programs will impact the future of our country? The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technology (OTT) has just released its  2002 Quality Metric Report (PDF 1.6 MB) . The report discusses the potential emissions benefits, petroleum reductions, and economic impacts that 41 OTT-funded programs will have on the United States from 2001 until 2030. Light-duty vehicle technologies were evaluated for passenger automobiles and class 1 and 2 ""light"" trucks. These technologies included flexible fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends), electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas, and stratified charge direct injection. Hybrid, natural gas, and advanced diesel technologies were evaluated for heavy-duty vehicles. Various analytical tools were used to develop the results. Each separate technology was analyzed according to when and how quickly the new technology could potentially enter the marketplace.         Maryland Opens First Ethanol Station   Many were on hand November 14 to celebrate the opening of Maryland's first public access ethanol fueling station. Located at 3240 Fort Meade Road (Rt. 198) in Laurel, Md., the Chevron station will dispense E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Construction of the new station was made possible through a U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded to the Maryland Energy Administration.    An alternative fuel made from renewable resources, such as corn or biomass, ethanol has significant emissions benefits versus reformulated gasoline. Its use in flexible fuel vehicles can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increase our nation's energy security.       QUANTUM and ProCon Begin Production of Dedicated Propane Vans   QUANTUM Technologies WorldWide, Inc., and the Propane Promotion Consortium, Inc., (ProCon) announced that they will begin production on two models of dedicated propane vans. The only dedicated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vans available on the market, the G2500 passenger van and the G3500 cargo van will be certified ULEV (California ultra low emission vehicle) and ILEV (federal inherently low emission vehicle) and have a maximum range of about 250 miles. Production will begin immediately but there will be a two-month waiting period after orders are placed. Vans will be available through selected General Motors dealers nationwide. For more information, visit the  QUANTUM  Web site.     DOE's Regional Biomass Energy Program recently completed eight new  success story fact sheets  that are available on the RBEP Web site.

September 2001     New EPRI Study Indicates Consumers Favor Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles   A recent study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California shows that consumers favor potential plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology because it offers savings on fuel and maintenance, use of an existing 120-volt infrastructure, and increased range over current gas electric hybrid vehicles.     Conventional HEVs such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius have fuel economies close to 42 mpg and rely on a gasoline engine to generate the electricity used to recharge the hybrid system's battery. The gasoline engine of the plug-in hybrid would be used more as a ""power-assist"" for long trips or on steep hills, and give the vehicle a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg. When fully charged, a plug-in HEV would act as a pure electric vehicle (EV) capable of traveling up to 60 miles daily in EV mode.    30 to 50 percent of the participants surveyed indicated that they would choose a plug-in HEV or non-plug HEV even if the car were priced 25 percent higher than a conventionally powered vehicle costing $19,000. 63 percent of those surveyed said they preferred plugging in an HEV at home because they could make use of a nearby 120-volt outlet.    Although there are no plug-in HEV models currently in production, the environmental and petroleum reduction benefits associated with these vehicles, along with the fact that they can be deployed with little to no change to the fueling infrastructure make them very attractive to both consumers and automakers.  Full Story .    Electric Trolleys to Grace Connecticut Streets  The city of New Haven recently unveiled its plan to create a new downtown shuttle service using four electric trolleys that will help shoppers get around the fragmented retail district.  According to Lee Grannis, a coordinator with the Greater New Haven Clean Cities Coalition, most of the $1 million price tag for the four trolleys will be offset by federal grants. New Haven will pay about $200,000.  Manufactured by California-based Ebus, each air-conditioned trolley can carry 27 people and travel between 75 and 100 miles between charges.        August 2001     Water Taxi Launches Hybrid ""Water Bus""   Water Taxi  in southern Florida recently launched its first hybrid electric ""water bus""— The Clay Shaw  (named after the Florida congressman).

July 2001      Honda Opens Hydrogen Refueling Station in L.A.   American Honda Motors Corporation took a step into the future of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles by opening the first hydrogen refueling station in Los Angeles this week.  The state-of-the-art refueling station is completely self-sufficient and uses solar power to produce enough hydrogen to power a single fuel cell vehicle for a year. Photovoltaic cells located at the station collect energy from the sun, which is then converted into electricity for extracting hydrogen from water. Extracted hydrogen is then pumped into storage tanks for use by hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Honda fuel cell vehicles have been on the road since 1999 as part of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership (CAFCP) .     GTI to Hold Metropolitan Energy Design Competition   Do you think you have a solution for meeting the future energy needs of our nation's expanding cities? The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) is looking for your unique ideas on how to solve future problems such as energy shortages, unreliable delivery of electricity, highway gridlock, air and water pollution, and urban sprawl. Based on the theme  Energizing America's Cities , the U.S. Competition on Metropolitan Energy Design ( PDF 130 KB ) is sponsored by GTI in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy and the energy industry. The top eight designs will be presented at the  Energizing America's Cities  conference in Chicago on May 30-31, 2002.

RFA Vice President Confirms Ethanol Supply During Senate Energy Hearing   Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) Vice President Bob Dinneen met with members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week to assure committee members that the ethanol industry would be able to meet the oxygenate demand for reformulated gasoline in California. Early this year the state of California petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be waived from the gasoline oxygenate requirement mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. The EPA later denied California's waiver request. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), currently used as an oxygenate additive in reformulated gasoline, is contaminating ground water supplies in California, as well as several other states. Using Ethanol instead of MTBE as an oxygenate blend in reformulated gasoline has many favorable benefits. Like MTBE, ethanol will increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline, however ethanol is not harmful to the environment and is a renewable fuel. Blending ethanol with reformulated gasoline will also help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. During the meeting with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dinneen told members that 34 existing ethanol plants are undergoing expansion and eleven new plants are under construction. As a result, the ethanol industry expects to have an additional 300 million gallons of production capacity on line by the end of this year.       June 2001      Propane Education & Research Council Recognizes Six Fleets with ""Exceptional Energy"" Awards   Six vehicle fleets were recognized for their outstanding leadership in implementing propane as a motor fuel at 7th National Clean Cities Conference and Exposition on May 16, 2001.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Develops New Clean Emissions Technology   Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed an emissions technology capable of reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines by 50%. This new technology employs the use of an electrically charged gas called plasma, along with a class of zeolite catalyst to reduce harmful vehicle exhaust emissions. NOx produced by cars running on gasoline and diesel fuel is a leading contributor to ground-level ozone and smog, which has been linked to lung damage, asthma, cancer, and premature death. New hybrid electric diesel engines developed by the big three automakers are already capable of meeting the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goal of 80 miles per gallon. As researchers continue to refine this process, use of the plasma reactor concept with a catalyst could help achieve the other PNGV target of 90% reduction in NOx emissions.  Full Story .

Ford and Toyota Engage in Talks to Produce Joint Hybrid Vehicle  America's Ford Motor Company and Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation are discussing plans to develop a new hybrid electric gasoline vehicle that would be produced in North America. Both companies would benefit from the increased economies of scale that joint production would bring, because developing hybrid technology is extremely expensive. For example, Toyota began producing the hybrid-electric Prius subcompact in June of 2000, but continues to loose money on the sale of these vehicles despite record demand for them.     Both companies share a commitment to increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. Ford is a key industry participant in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and has pledged to improve the fuel economy of its sport-utility vehicles up to 25% by 2005. Toyota's experience developing fuel-efficient hybrid technology for the Prius could help Ford to achieve this goal.    Talks between Toyota and Ford started in July of 2000 when former chief executive, Jacques Nasser met with Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. Dialog continues between the two companies with William Clay Ford Jr. now at the helm of the American automobile manufacturer. Both companies hope to clinch a deal on the joint hybrid-electric venture by the end of the year.        November 2001     Hyundai Fuel Cell Vehicle Wins Gold at Michelin Challenge Bibendum   The Hyundai Santa Fe fuel cell-powered sport utility vehicle took home two gold medals and two silver medals at the 2001  Michelin Challenge Bibendum  held at the California Speedway in Fontana, California on October 26th -29th. This four-day event has traditionally been an excellent opportunity for motor vehicle manufacturers to showcase the performance of near-term and long-range environmentally innovative automobiles and demonstrate their compatibility with driving performance, comfort, and safety. Competing automobiles were judged in nine individual categories including design, acceleration, braking, handling, slalom, fuel economy, range, noise level, and emissions. Participating as a member of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership , the Santa Fe fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) faired extremely well in its first North American vehicle competition, earning gold medals in the emissions and noise tests and silver medals in the slalom and fuel efficiency trials. A total of six hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles from various manufacturers were entered in the competition.           GM Announces Production of Full-Size Ethanol Pickups   To meet the increasing U.S. demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), General Motors (GM) announced it would begin production of a full-sized flex-fuel pickup truck that can run on E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), regular gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels. The flex-fuel option will now be available on 1,500 series Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks that have 5,300 Vortec engines. The new pickups will increase GM's existing line of ethanol vehicles, which includes sport-utility vehicles such as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, and Chevy Suburban, as well as smaller pickups like the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma.

OTT Releases 2002 Quality Metrics Report    Interested in how light- and heavy-duty alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicle programs will impact the future of our country? The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technology (OTT) has just released its  2002 Quality Metric Report (PDF 1.6 MB) . The report discusses the potential emissions benefits, petroleum reductions, and economic impacts that 41 OTT-funded programs will have on the United States from 2001 until 2030. Light-duty vehicle technologies were evaluated for passenger automobiles and class 1 and 2 ""light"" trucks. These technologies included flexible fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends), electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas, and stratified charge direct injection. Hybrid, natural gas, and advanced diesel technologies were evaluated for heavy-duty vehicles. Various analytical tools were used to develop the results. Each separate technology was analyzed according to when and how quickly the new technology could potentially enter the marketplace.         Maryland Opens First Ethanol Station   Many were on hand November 14 to celebrate the opening of Maryland's first public access ethanol fueling station. Located at 3240 Fort Meade Road (Rt. 198) in Laurel, Md., the Chevron station will dispense E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Construction of the new station was made possible through a U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded to the Maryland Energy Administration.    An alternative fuel made from renewable resources, such as corn or biomass, ethanol has significant emissions benefits versus reformulated gasoline. Its use in flexible fuel vehicles can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increase our nation's energy security.

September 2001     New EPRI Study Indicates Consumers Favor Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles   A recent study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California shows that consumers favor potential plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology because it offers savings on fuel and maintenance, use of an existing 120-volt infrastructure, and increased range over current gas electric hybrid vehicles.     Conventional HEVs such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius have fuel economies close to 42 mpg and rely on a gasoline engine to generate the electricity used to recharge the hybrid system's battery. The gasoline engine of the plug-in hybrid would be used more as a ""power-assist"" for long trips or on steep hills, and give the vehicle a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg. When fully charged, a plug-in HEV would act as a pure electric vehicle (EV) capable of traveling up to 60 miles daily in EV mode.    30 to 50 percent of the participants surveyed indicated that they would choose a plug-in HEV or non-plug HEV even if the car were priced 25 percent higher than a conventionally powered vehicle costing $19,000. 63 percent of those surveyed said they preferred plugging in an HEV at home because they could make use of a nearby 120-volt outlet.    Although there are no plug-in HEV models currently in production, the environmental and petroleum reduction benefits associated with these vehicles, along with the fact that they can be deployed with little to no change to the fueling infrastructure make them very attractive to both consumers and automakers.

RFA Vice President Confirms Ethanol Supply During Senate Energy Hearing   Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) Vice President Bob Dinneen met with members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week to assure committee members that the ethanol industry would be able to meet the oxygenate demand for reformulated gasoline in California. Early this year the state of California petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be waived from the gasoline oxygenate requirement mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. The EPA later denied California's waiver request. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), currently used as an oxygenate additive in reformulated gasoline, is contaminating ground water supplies in California, as well as several other states. Using Ethanol instead of MTBE as an oxygenate blend in reformulated gasoline has many favorable benefits. Like MTBE, ethanol will increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline, however ethanol is not harmful to the environment and is a renewable fuel. Blending ethanol with reformulated gasoline will also help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. During the meeting with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dinneen told members that 34 existing ethanol plants are undergoing expansion and eleven new plants are under construction. As a result, the ethanol industry expects to have an additional 300 million gallons of production capacity on line by the end of this year.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Develops New Clean Emissions Technology   Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed an emissions technology capable of reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines by 50%. This new technology employs the use of an electrically charged gas called plasma, along with a class of zeolite catalyst to reduce harmful vehicle exhaust emissions. NOx produced by cars running on gasoline and diesel fuel is a leading contributor to ground-level ozone and smog, which has been linked to lung damage, asthma, cancer, and premature death. New hybrid electric diesel engines developed by the big three automakers are already capable of meeting the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goal of 80 miles per gallon. As researchers continue to refine this process, use of the plasma reactor concept with a catalyst could help achieve the other PNGV target of 90% reduction in NOx emissions.  Full Story .

April 2001       Transit Authority of Cedar Rapids Fuels Buses with Biodiesel   In March, the transit authority of Cedar Rapids Iowa made the decision to begin using biodiesel to fuel their fleet of over 60 buses. Officials said that the decision to begin using B20 (a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) was made because the environmentally friendly soy-based fuel will produce less air pollution then conventional diesel fuel. The use of biodiesel made from soybean oil (soy-diesel) will also help to promoted agriculture in the region.  Biodiesel is non-toxic, biodegradable, and produces significantly fewer EPA targeted emissions then conventional diesel. No modifications are required to diesel engines when switching to B20, and there is no loss of vehicle performance.

The document was intended to give a ""snapshot"" of current vehicle technologies and trends. DOE program managers use the document to plan test and evaluation activities that focus resources where they have the greatest impact. In 2001, an update to the original document was published. This document is the update for CY 2002. All of these publications are available at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog _info.html. The information in this document is based on several sources, which are listed in the Appendix. Most of the statistics came from the following sources: - The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Review, Monthly Energy Review, and Alternatives to Traditional Transportation Fuels; - Transportation Energy Data Book (edition 21), published by DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Air Pollution Emissions Trends Web site, www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/trends/index.html. These publications are usually produced annually. We used the most recent volumes available. The information on advanced technology vehicles in development came from various sources, including vehicle manufacturers and news services. Because this information changes daily, we set February 1, 2002, as the cut-off date for inclusion in this document. However, the vehicle tables will be updated on a quarterly basis and posted as separate documents on the Internet at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog_info.html.  Transportation Energy Use The transportation sector in the United States is a major consumer of energy. Figure 1 shows the total U.S. energy consumption from 1950 to 2000, categorized by transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial consumption. During 2000, transportation accounted for approximately 27% of the total energy consumption of 98.5 quadrillion Btu/year (source: EIA's Annual Energy Review). This is a 1.7% increase over total energy use for 1999.  1   Fi gure 1.

Figure 2 shows the dramatic difference between consumption and production. Although the gap only increased by 0.07% from 1999 to 2000, the average increase since 1985 was 4.5% per year. The balance of petroleum consumed by the U.S. is imported. According to EIA's Monthly Energy Review, nearly 59% of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. during 2000 (19.5 million barrels per day) was imported. In 2000, 45.4% of the total U.S. petroleum imports came from OPEC countries. (Table A in the Appendix lists U.S. petroleum imports by country.) Fi gure 2. U. S.

This is a slight decrease from the previous year. Figure 4 gives the breakdown of highway energy use by mode for 1999. The mix of vehicle types hasn't significantly changed since 1998. In 2001, an estimated 164 billion gallons of fuel were consumed in the U. S.--an increase of 1.5% over the previous year. Figure 5 shows the breakdown of fuel use by fuel type. Gasoline continues to make up approximately 77% of the fuel consumed. This percentage includes oxygenated fuels (methyl tertiary butyl ether [MTBE] and ethanol), which make up about 3% of the gasoline total. Diesel fuel comprises 22.9% of total vehicle fuel consumption during 2001. Fi gure 5. Estim a te d Consum pti on of Fue l s in the US (2001) Dies el 22.9% Alt. Fuel 0.2%  Fi gure 6.

Although alternative fuel makes up only 0.2% of the total fuel consumed in the United States, alternative fuel use has increased by about 4% per year during the past four years. Table 1 shows the percent difference in alternative fuel use for the past four years by  3   fuel type. Use of natural gas has increased steadily since 1997. Ethanol use continues to climb mainly because of the production of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) vehicles that are E85 compatible as standard and an increase in fueling stations offering E85. The majority of these new E85 stations are located in the Midwest. Electric vehicle use is also growing, especially in California where more than 16% of the total U.S. alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) reside. Table 1.

The majority of these vehicles were used for personal transportation, while only 6% were fleet vehicles. Figures 7a and b show the annual sales of vehicles for 1999 through 2001. Sales of automobiles and light trucks in 1999 broke the previous record set in 1986. Sales for 2000 were 2.7% higher than 1999. Despite predictions of low sales in 2001, light-duty vehicle sales were only 1.3% lower than in 2000. Automobiles as a group lost sales by nearly 4%, while light-duty trucks gained by 1.4%. The percentage of automobile verses light-duty trucks was nearly equal: 50.4% automobiles, 49.6% light-duty trucks. Sales of heavy-duty trucks (class 4 -8) declined by 25% in 2001, with the class 8 sector being hardest hit at 34% lower than 2000 figures. Figure 7a .

In 2000, an estimated 432,344 AFVs were in use in the U.S., representing an average 7% increase per year since 1992. Table 2 lists the 4   number of AFVs in the U.S. by fuel type and census region for 2000. Figure 8 breaks down the percentages of AFVs in use in 2000 by fuel type. Propane (or LPG) vehicles make up the bulk of AFVs at 62%. This includes original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products as well as aftermarket conversions. The second most common fuel used is natural gas, including compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which makes up 23.7% of the total. Alcohol-fueled vehicles that run on methanol and ethanol make up a combined 10.3% of the total AFVs, and electric vehicles (EVs) make up only 2%. According to EIA, the number of E85 compatible vehicles is around 34,700, a number that is deceptively low. Since 1998, most of the major OEMs have been producing certain models with an E85 engine as standard. The EIA counts include only vehicles that are intended to be used as flex-fuel vehicles. The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition estimates that more than 2 million E85 vehicles will be on the road by the end of the 2002 model year. Table 2.

Table 3 shows the number of alternative fueling stations in the U.S. by fuel and census region. According to DOE's Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), 5,443 fueling stations offered alternative fuels as of January 28, 2002. Stations offering E85 and electric charging stations saw an increase of nearly 31%. Methanol as a vehicular fuel has been decreasing over the past few years as a result of M85 products no longer being available. There are no longer any stations in the U.S. offering M85 fuel. Biodiesel is a fuel that has increased in popularity, mainly because the 20% blend of the fuel (B20) can be used in unmodified diesel engines.  5   Table 3.

These models operate on a variety of fuels, including CNG, LPG, electricity, and ethanol. Manufacturers are producing AFVs in all body styles to meet various fleet needs, from small two-seaters to full-size trucks and vans. For a list of AFVs available in the U.S. for model year 2002, see Table B in the Appendix. Alternative fuel and advanced technology heavy-duty vehicles are also available. The major engine manufacturers currently offer 20 alternative fuel engines (see Table C in the Appendix). This number includes natural gas and LPG fueled engines. Bus and heavy-duty truck manufacturers use these engines in a wide variety of vehicles.  Emissions As shown in Table 4, the transportation sector accounts for a large share of the national emissions of criteria pollutants. Highway vehicle emissions are somewhat less but still make up a significant portion of the overall contribution. These percentages are similar to the previous year. Table 4.

The tables contain an update to those provided in the original document and concentrate on the vehicles most likely to be available in the U.S. market. For a more complete listing of ATVs around the world, refer to the companion tables on the Internet at www. ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog _info.html. Definitions of the terms used to describe the development stage of a given vehicle vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply:      Research  In the early stages of development (drawings or models). Concept  An actual vehicle, usually operational, used by the manufacturer as a display or show vehicle. Prototype  A working vehicle, very close to a production model. Demonstration  Limited production of the vehicle being tested by the manufacturer in a real-world application. Production  Available to the public.  7   Hybrid Electric Technology Light-Duty Vehicles Automotive manufacturers continue to work on hybrid technology, especially for the light-duty market. Second year sales of the two hybrids introduced in the U.S. market, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, were higher than in 2000. Sales of the Toyota Prius increased by 40% versus 2000. Sales of the Prius passed 14,000 units since its introduction in July 2000. Sales of the Honda Insight were up 25% versus 2000 totals, totaling 4,726 during 2001. Table 5 lists the hybrid vehicles in production, as well as the most recent vehicles introduced in the past few years. (For more information on these and other light-duty hybrid vehicles introduced around the world, refer to the companion tables on the Internet.) Several new hybrid vehicles have been developed and introduced in the past year and more are reaching the market. The Honda Civic HEV is planned to go on sale in spring of 2002. As Honda's second hybrid vehicle to market, the Civic is expected to do well. Ford's hybrid version of their popular Escape SUV is expected to hit the market in early 2003. Notable examples of hybrids announced in the past year include the General Motors (GM) Silverado/Sierra pickup, the Daihatsu UFE, and the Toyota ES3. GM's HEV Sierra is expected to be the first hybrid available as a full size truck. Designed with the full power and towing capacity of a typical truck, the HEV Sierra is expected to have approximately 20% better fuel economy. GM plans to produce the truck for the 2004 model year (MY). Daihatsu introduced its UFE (Ultra Fuel Economy) at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2001. This ultra-light four-seat coupe uses a direct injection gasoline engine and achieves 129 mpg. Toyota introduced the ES3 sedan at the Frankfort Auto Show in September of 2001. The ES3 (Eco Spirit Cubic) uses a 1.4 liter, direct injection, turbo diesel engine that achieves 88 mpg. The vehicle runs on ultra low sulfur diesel and employs the latest catalytic converter technology to reduce both NOx and PM. The hybrid system on this vehicle uses ultracaps to capture braking energy. Table 5.

The past two years has seen an increase in numbers of heavy-duty vehicles on order. According to the APTA 2001 Vehicle Databook, there were 42 hybrid buses in active service as of January 1, 2001, with more than 400 on order and a potential for approximately 100 more. Table 6 lists some of the more significant heavy vehicle projects. DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies and the Field Operations Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are conducting an evaluation of New York City Transit's hybrid buses. The results are expected to be released in early 2002 through the AFDC Web site at www.afdc.doe.gov, or by calling 1800-423-1DOE.  9   Table 6.

The majority of fuel cell projects to date use transit buses. Table 8 lists projects involving fuel cell heavy vehicles, including projects underway in Europe. For a more complete list of heavy-duty fuel cell projects, see the companion tables at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog_info.html. Several U.S. transit agencies are in the process of procuring fuel cell buses for demonstration programs required by the California Air Resources Board. AC Transit of Oakland, Calif., and SunLine Transit Agency of Thousand Palms, Calif., are finalizing plans to order several fuel cell buses for this demonstration. DOE through NREL is working with both agencies to evaluate this new technology. Table 8.

Of note are: California Air Resources Board (CARB) Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate  In January 2001, CARB adopted a credit program to provide OEMs extra credit for placing ZEVs before the required date of the ruling. This was to encourage early placement of EVs into the market. The credit program would give an automaker multiple credits for selling small neighborhood electric vehicles prior to the start of the ruling. Concerns were made that these credits would allow an OEM to meet their mandate without selling a fullscale EV. In December of 2001, CARB modified the ruling to limit how auto manufacturers use advance credits to offset actual ZEV sales. CARB also announced that SUV, minivan, and pickup sales would count toward the baseline calculation of each OEMs vehicle sales. This means that the total number of EVs required by the mandate will be larger that previously expected. Studies Link Pollution to Birth Defects and Asthma  Several studies released in 2001 show evidence of health effects of vehicular pollution. A study released by University of California-Los Angeles in December showed a link between air quality and infant birth defects. This article was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. Results from another study by the University of California-Davis supports the idea that asthma in children and adults might be related to living in areas with poor air quality. Studies such as these could lead to increased air quality legislation. CLEAR ACT Introduced  A bill was introduced to Congress to spur the use of vehicles that operate on alternative fuels as well as efficient advanced automotive technology. The Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies or CLEAR ACT would give credits to purchase efficient automobiles, such as fuel cell and hybrids; credits for AFVs; credits for alternative fuel use; and credits for installation of residential or retail fueling infrastructure.  Summary The focus, direction, and funding of transportation programs and the marketplace for advanced technologies is continually changing and developing. Understanding these trends within the context of today's marketplace is critical to focusing public and private resources where they can have the most impact. Key points from this document include:        The gap between U.S. consumption and production of petroleum is widening at the rate of 4.5% per year (average from 1985 through 2001). Light-duty trucks and automobiles continue to be the major consumer with respect to transportation energy use. Alternative fuel use continues to increase by 4% each year. This is insignificant compared to the increasing gap between production and consumption of petroleum. The number of alternative fuel stations increased by 4.4% versus the previous year. There is significantly more development in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle markets. Fuel cells and hydrogen appear to be the vision of the future from the auto industry perspective.  12   13   Appendix  14   Table A.

In this guest letter, she explains the purpose behind Clean Cities International. Dear Readers: I will never forget the first time I landed in Delhi, air was foggy and oppressive. I'm not often bothered as we loaded my luggage into a taxi. As we made our children living on the streets with very little shelter; greenery; and streets congested by noisy three-wheel India in July of 2000. It was late, and the by allergies, but my throat and eyes burned way to the hotel, I could see women and cows eating what seemed to be the last bit of rickshaws.  My first thought was, ""What am I doing here? These people still need the basics--food, shelter, and clean water."" Their plight seemed overwhelming, and my mission inconsequential. But soon I realized that everyone, irrespective of caste or station in life, needs clean air. And yes, the Clean Cities Program can play a part in improving life in the developing world. Since then, I've returned to Delhi on several occasions, often accompanied by trainers and technical experts from the United States. Our mission has been to help establish a safe, clean fueling infrastructure in India, and much progress has been made. Delhi itself has taken bold steps toward that end, such as converting its own bus fleet to CNG. The city has announced plans to join us as an international partner. Clean recently, extreme tionship Cities International has made inroads in other developing nations including, most Bangladesh. India's neighbor to the east is similarly poor, crowded, and burdened by levels of air pollution. We've conducted CNG training in Dhaka, and a partnering relawith that city is set to begin this year (see page 10 for details.)  We've conducted reverse trade missions in this country, welcoming foreign delegates to educational and networking events such as the World NGV Conference and our own annual convention. We've established valuable relationships with developed nations as well. (Read the latest about our relationship with CIVITAS, the bold environmental initiative of the European Union, on page 15.) We recently hosted a conference Upcoming on LPG for vehicular use in Mexico City.  Conferences and Events 9th Annual National Ethanol Conference February 3-6, 2004 Washington, D.C.

In the Philippines, for example, an interagency agreement between USAID and DOE is crafted in part to help develop ways to make biodiesel from domestic coconut oil. Why do we do it? The second most important reason, perhaps, is business development. Cultivating interest in alterative fuels abroad generates business for countless U.S. companies. Providers of fuel, dispensers, pipelines, and engineering services have already benefited from our efforts. To my knowledge, there is no other program to help the developing world systematically build safe and effective alternative fuel vehicle programs. The most important reason for our international efforts is more fundamental. We are all part of this beautiful planet, connected in so many ways. Developing nations need not just technical and financial support. They need friends. Gandhi said, ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" I am grateful that this notion is embraced by so many people connected with the Clean Cities Program, both here and throughout the world.  10th National Clean Cities Conference May 25, 2004 Ft.

The opening of public alternative fueling stations used to be big news. Unveiling new sites called for ribbon-cutting, balloons, and speeches, as supporters turned out to cheer the first fill-up with any non-petroleum fuel. Even adding E85 or biodiesel pumps at gasoline stations was often a cause for celebration. In what can only be considered a success for alternative fuels, it's no longer that way. Grand openings don't always accompany expansion of the local infrastructure, says Yvonne Anderson, coordinator of the Central Oklahoma Clean Cities coalition. ""It has become more commonplace,"" she says. The coalition still deploys PR tactics when new stations open around Oklahoma City. But often they're merely a hook to solicit media coverage of alternative fuels in general. Growth in alternative fuels is evident to users of DOE's Alternative Fuel Station Locator (visit the Alternative Fuel Data Center at www.afdc.doe.gov and click on Refueling Sites). Its database is updated regularly. Most fuel types logged net gains in the 12-month period ending on October 31, 2003. Sellers of natural gas (especially CNG) were the exception, showing net declines during the 12-month period. While natural gas volume has risen steadily, the number of stations nationwide has fallen due to industry consolidation (more on page 6). PIX 12827  The Dakota Ridge RV Center can supply propane for vehicle use as well as camping, says attendant Garland Wright. Top: Amigo Oil's Phillips 66 station in Santa Fe, New Mexico celebrated the addition of E85 fueling with a grand opening in July.

Because vehicle fueling is often a smaller portion of their business, these propane stations have sometimes been difficult to identify through the years. In the past year, special attention has been given to identifying all LPG vendors, resulting in many newly identified stations. More than 4,000 propane vendors are now listed the station locator database.  *Includes both new stations and stations newly identified  4   A small but growing part of the LPG business offers modern, convenient, credit card-enabled fuel dispensers at major brand service stations. Many are part of the CleanFUEL USA Network, which includes stations in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. A key player in that network is Clean Fueling Technologies, a dispenser manufacturer headed by Curtis Donaldson. With help from a grant from the state of Texas, the company plans to build six LPG stations along the 80-mile corridor between Austin and San Antonio. Austin is also the site of a new, modern LPG station serving the city's airport. The state-of-the-art station was financed with grants from the city of Austin and the Propane Education and Research Council. It is used both by private motorists and airport vehicles, including a fleet of 29 shuttle buses. The station will dispense 1.3 million gallons of fuel per year, including 300,000 gallons of new sales. It is expected to be open by January 2004.  HELP WANTED Updating the Database It's a big job maintaining the database that serves the Alternative Fuel Station Locator and Route Mapper. Existing data is verified annually, but many stations open, and some close, every day. Information about new sites comes from a variety sources including fuel trade associations, station owners and operators, press releases, and media coverage. Our best allies in the quest, however, are private individuals who use alternative fuels. The Clean Cities Program urges AFV drivers to let us know when a new station opens or an old one closes, or when you spot inaccuracies in our data. Call the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE. For new stations, fill out the Refueling Stations Submission Form at www.afdc.doe.gov/refuel/stations_add.html.  Biodiesel The nation's biodiesel infrastructure expanded considerably during the 12-month period, adding a net total of 93 stations. Of those 93, thirteen are private sites operated by a single entity--the North Carolina Department of Transportation, which has prioritized biodiesel use in recent years. Biodiesel is growing rapidly both among consumers and in EPAct-regulated fleets. In the nation's State & Alternative Fuel Provider fleets alone, biodiesel use rose from less than 1 million gallons in 2001 to 2.66 million gallons in 2002. Kelly Feil operates Click's Kicks 66, a modern Phillips station, in Boise, Idaho. Feil was asked by the state's Department of Water Resources to participate in a one-year biodiesel pilot program. The station hadn't sold diesel before, but it designated one tank and dispenser for B20. Now it sells 400-500 gallons per day. Waste management company BFI is an excellent customer, using the fuel in trash trucks. Several individuals buy it too. ""People think it's great,"" says Feil. The interest of private motorists rises noticeably when prices drop. Feil's station has one big advantage, he says. It is Idaho's only retail seller of biodiesel. Twenty miles from Boulder, Colorado is the town of Rollinsville. Barely a wide spot in the road, it has one restaurant, a post office, and the Rollinsville Country Store. Sold along with food and fishing tackle are five-gallon containers of B100 biodiesel fuel. The price is $13.75. Customers may borrow a funnel and fill up on-site, or take the jug home. ""We make three or four sales a week,"" says Christine Gellatly, who owns and operates the store with her husband. Customers include construction workers driving diesel pickup trucks and locals commuting to Boulder in passenger cars. ""They buy it for environmental reasons, and they usually say something about reducing imported oil,"" says Gellatly. The store's fuel comes from Boulder Biodiesel, a member-owned cooperative that obtains the fuel from a distributor for Iowa-based West Central Soy.  Government agencies such as the National Park Service, with diesel buses serving Yellowstone, aren't the only consumers of biodiesel fuel. A growing grassroots movement of motorists is served by small sellers such as Christine Gellatly at the Rollinsville Country Store. National Park Service/PIX 12854  5  PIX 12847   Station Stories E85 The nation's corn belt is best known for ethanol production and E85 fueling. But E85 has established roots in at least 26 states, thanks in part to grants from the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition (NEVC). Nationwide, stations selling E85 experienced a net gain of 30 in the one-year period ending in October.  - continued  In its first few weeks, E85 sales were modest--fewer than 200 gallons per week. But public interest in the fuel was quite strong, says Richard Mason of Renewable Energy Partners. ""People in Santa Fe are environmentally conscious,"" he says. Signage on the dispensers is so attractive, says Mason, that it has drawn much interest from motorists, including those driving gasoline-only vehicles. The station has had to devise ways to discourage people from buying E85 if their cars can't handle it. Mason's organization is working with car dealers in Santa Fe to expand sales of used flexible-fuel vehicles, with an online marketplace at www.renewableenergypartners.org. A second E85 station in Santa Fe, at a more central location, will also sell B20. NEVC grants also helped pay for E85 fueling at several Acorn Fuel Store sites in Colorado. ""Most of the people buying E85 are repeat customers,"" says company operations manager Tom Mousaw. ""I know there are a lot of other people who have flexible fuel vehicles and don't know it,"" he says.  Natural Gas While other fuels move toward more diversified forms of distribution, natural gas sites seem to be moving toward ownership by fewer, stronger operators. The number of CNG and LNG stations experienced a combined net decline of 193 during the 12-month period. Many of the closed ""stations,"" however, were private, slow-fill units operated by utility companies. Some see the decline as a nationwide ""right-sizing"" of the sector. Many stations were ill fated from the start, says Jim Harger of California-based Clean Energy Fuels. Utility companies have often focused on municipal fleets  6  Alternative Fuels Vehicle Network/PIX 12856  An E85 dispenser now serves customers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at a Phillips 66 station owned by Amigo Oil. E85 fueling was added as part of a complete overhaul of the site, which was celebrated with a grand opening in July. An NEVC grant for the E85 dispenser was secured by Renewable Energy Partners, a nonprofit organization that also engineered the installation. The fuel is blended in Albuquerque with ethanol from Archer Daniels Midland, which delivers it by truck from the Midwest.  A net reduction in the number of CNG facilities nationwide stems from industry consolidation. Fewer, bigger sites--such as this Clean Energy Fuels station in Phoenix--have replaced many smaller ones. Below: At Amigo Oil's modern Phillips station in Santa Fe, attractive signage helps create a mainstream image for E85.  Clean Energy Fuels/PIX 12855   Of the 90 Costco stores in California, approximately 68 offer EV charging. That state has adopted conductive charging as a standard, but Costco still provides paddle-type inductive chargers as well, for cars such as GM's EV1. The service is provided to customers at ""no charge.""  or individual consumers, with disappointing sales results. Successful natural gas stations must focus on serving large ""anchor tenants"" such as waste management companies. ""Without an anchor tenant, the station doesn't make sense,"" says Harger. Station closing details from the 12-month period confirm Harger's observation. Eleven stations operated in Ohio by East Ohio Gas were confirmed closed. Northern Indiana Public Service closed 10 NiSource stations in Indiana. Consolidation of ownership is another factor in the net decline in natural gas station totals. Clean Energy Fuels has acquired certain chains of stations, including the Denverbased Natural Fuels sites. Some underperforming sites were closed in the process. Those that remain are bigger, better situated, and dispensing more fuel than ever per station and in total. Although the number of natural gas fueling sites may have dropped, sales of the fuel nationwide are rising steadily. CNG and LNG sales in 2002 reached 113 million gasoline gallons equivalent (gge). That's an increase of 1.5 percent over the previous year. The 2002 total is up 74 percent from the 1997 total of 65 million gge.  The true total is much higher than that, says Enid Joffe of the Clean Fuel Connection, a company that installs the stations. Perhaps 2,000 chargers are in California alone, without even counting residential installations, she says. Public chargers have been put in parking garages, shopping centers, and airports. Many were installed with public funds and are available for use free of charge. Non-public sites are found at schools, military bases, government agencies, and utility companies. EV charging is one of several forms of alternative fueling available to the public at San Diego's new Regional Transportation Center. (The state-of-the art RTC also sells biodiesel, natural gas, LPG, and E85 along with gasoline and low-sulfur diesel. See AFN 7-2, page 16.) Its EV chargers are free for public use, and usually all six are open, said an attendant. One regular customer has been known to settle in for a nap while fueling his Ford Ranger. A member of the San Diego Clean Fuels Coalition plugs in her Ford TH!NK City while conducting business at the RTC. EV drivers in California can charge their vehicles at approximately 68 of the 90 Costco sales warehouses in the state. Costco charging sites include both inductive and conductive chargers, with two to six plug-ins per location. EV charging is free to Costco members. ""We consider it a logical, valuable service we can offer. When people come to one of our warehouses, they usually stay a while,"" says Ed Fitzgerald, director of automobile-related sales for the company. EV charging at Costco is neither on the increase nor declining, says Fitzgerald. ""The automakers aren't offering electric vehicles any more, but there are still quite a few of them on the road in California."" Outside of that state, EV charging is available at a few Costco sites in Georgia and Arizona. ""Generally, we've put them where the vehicles are,"" he says.  EV Charging The sale of new, fully street-capable all-electric vehicles in the United States has essentially stopped, at least temporarily, with the discontinuation of Toyota's RAV4-EV and Ford's line of TH!NK cars. But many ""production"" EVs and smaller neighborhood electric vehicles remain on the road, with the highest concentration in California. The 12-month period ending in October brought a net addition of 36 EV charging sites, raising the total known nationwide to 875.  Costco/PIX 12826  7   Clubs and co-ops are focusing demand on select stations, buying fuel in bulk, and helping to reshape the market.  Biodiesel Buying Power Although fleets represent by far the biggest share of biodiesel fuel users nationwide, private motorists are a growing force in the biodiesel market. Motivated more by environmental concerns than by mandates, individuals are filling up at mainstream service stations whenever possible, and--when necessary--at more unlikely places such as industrial fuel sites, neighborhood grocery stores, and their own garages. To ensure a steady fuel supply, some biodiesel users have formed co-ops and informal buying groups. ""People are using a market mechanism to concentrate their buying power,"" says Gene Gebolys, president of the nation's largest biodiesel supplier, World Energy. Customers often promise their collective business to a single station, hoping to convince the operator it's worthwhile to dedicate a tank and dispenser to biodiesel. One such station is operated by Massachusetts-based Burke Oil. The company is engaged mainly in distributing petroleum fuel and lubricants to service stations operated by other companies. Its only proprietary station is located in Chelsea, near the headquarters of World Energy. Burke was asked both by World Energy and local owners of dieselfueled cars to consider selling biodiesel at retail. It started dispensing B20 from an unused kerosene tank in mid-2002. ""I had no idea how popular it would be,"" says Ted Burke, vice president of sales for Burke Oil. The station now has approximately 75 retail customers buying 2,500 gallons of B20 biodiesel per month. Sales are growing rapidly, he says. ""It's small compared to gasoline sales; not enough to build a business on,"" Burke admits. But demand has been strong enough for Burke Oil to install a new 2,000-gallon tank and dispenser strictly for biodiesel. The company also sells 150,000-200,000 gallons of biodiesel per year, delivered in bulk, to truck fleets.  Burke's retail customers include many enthusiast drivers of older diesel-powered Volkswagens. One is Nate Byrnes, a long-time biodiesel user who maintains a Web presence at BiodieselNow.com. Volkswagen does not endorse biodiesel use in the United States, however, and using it will void the manufacturer's new-car engine warranty. Diesel vehicles from other automakers include domestic pickup trucks and older Mercedes-Benz sedans. A comprehensive list of diesel vehicles made since 1960 is published at www.gobiodiesel.org/years.html.  Many biofueled diesel cars appeared at last year's opening of a biodiesel station in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Speakers included (from top) Gene Gebolys of World Energy, Ed Burke of Burke Oil, and biodiesel user Nate Byrnes. General Motors recently authorized blends up to B5, which is 5 percent biodiesel, for use in certain drivetrain configurations of 2004 model pickup trucks including the Chevrolet Silverado (below).  Wieck Photo Database  8  BiodieselNow.com/PIX 12857   Commercial biodiesel sales began in Boulder, Colorado with the September 2003 opening of a public B20 dispenser: From left: Bryan Flansburg and Paul Tabolt of the University of Colorado, Boulder Mayor Will Toor, and facility owner Joe Swank. The fuel comes from Blue Sun Biodiesel, a Coloradobased broker of biodiesel.  In the area around Chelsea and Boston, Byrnes says, Burke's station is the only retail site selling biodiesel. Before that facility went in, some diesel drivers were routinely taking four-hour Sunday trips to another supplier in Maine, returning with five-gallon containers filled with B100. Some still do that, he says, rather than settle for the B20 sold by Burke Oil. In areas of the country where biodiesel isn't available at retail, motorists have taken matters into their own hands by forming cooperatives. The Connecticut Biodiesel Co-op, based near Hartford, typically keeps about 300 gallons of fuel on hand for its members. The fuel is acquired from World Energy and sold to members ""at cost."" It is delivered in 30- and 55-gallon drums to locations within a two-hour driving distance. Another, similar co-op is established near Trenton, New Jersey. Home fueling and storage is a realistic option for many biodiesel users, says Dan Freeman, owner of Dr. Dan's Alternative Fuel Werks in Seattle, Washington. ""They don't have to rely on an established service station,"" he says. ""Biodiesel is not considered a hazardous material. It's no more dangerous than the vegetable oil in your kitchen."" Freeman offers 275-gallon tanks and electric pumps for sale to individuals and co-ops. (Visit www.fuelwerks.com.) He also sells biodiesel (as well as CNG) at his own location, where the primary business is auto repair. Biodiesel sales have been as high as 11,000 gallons per month, he says. ""In my first year, my customers tended to be techies who found me on the Web. Usually they came in knowing more about biodiesel than I did,"" he says. Since then, his customer base has broadened. Many are recent converts to the fuel. Some co-ops are personified more by community activists than auto enthusiasts. One is Colorado-based Boulder Biodiesel, which calls itself ""a coalition of environmental scientists, citizen activists, students and permaculture design consultants who advocate the use of biodiesel as  an alternative fuel source."" The co-op was instrumental in persuading a wholesale fuel distributor in Boulder to sell biodiesel at a public retail site, which opened for business in September 2003. Boulder Biodiesel offers education and technical assistance to its members, and is experimenting with fuel production using waste grease from local restaurants. Small producers aspiring to sell their own fuel face one important issue. Biodiesel sold commercially must meet ASTM D 6751, a quality standard defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials. To avoid the high costs of required testing, small-volume sellers usually purchase fuel for their members from larger distributors. All sellers, even small ones, are subject to motor fuel tax collection requirements. Grease Works is an Oregon-based co-op that started out with plans to make fuel from waste grease. It was later re-organized as a ""bulk buying club."" Members pay annual dues of $75, which entitles them to a discounted price on fuel purchases. Those who choose home storage get free delivery, storage drums, and hand-operated pumps. On its Web site, Grease Works bills itself as ""one of the most inspired grassroots organizations in the country."" (Visit www.greaseworks.org.) Grease Works gets its fuel from Sequential Fuels, a distributor for World Energy. To co-ops distributing biodiesel--even just to their own members--quality assurance is an important responsibility, says Linda Graham, coordinator of the Puget Sound Clean Cities Coalition. ""Ultimately we want biodiesel to seem normal to people. That won't happen unless it's handled properly by everyone in the chain."" The role of co-ops within Clean Cities is also important, she says. ""They're not for everybody, but they are definitely a step in the right direction. They're helping to expand alternative fuels beyond the realm of fleets, into the mainstream.""  9  City of Boulder/PIX 12825   Clean Cities International News BANGLADESH ASG Renaissance/PIX 12858  Clean Cities International advances CNG in Southeast Asia Clean Cities has taken steps to induct the People's Republic of Bangladesh as an international member.

But significant growth has occurred in other countries including India, Pakistan, and Egypt. Co-owner Tom Sewell, his brother, has visited Bangladesh to cultivate new business. Accompanying Rood on the year's first trip to Bangladesh, in August, were Greg Zilberfarb of ASG Renaissance; Leo Thomason of the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute; and Bill McGlinchey of AFV Consulting. One thing they noticed immediately, said Zilberfarb, was evidence of recent, rapid growth in CNG fueling. Thousands of three-wheel rickshaws and many other vehicles have been converted to CNG. Many fueling stations had already been built. ""The problem is that there are no standards,"" he said. ""It looks a lot like the U.S. in the 1980s."" The lack of standards for nozzles on fuel dispensers, for example, results in many mishaps. Generally these systems use a probe that must be held firmly in place during fueling, rather than the locking type used in developed countries. Usually the fit is sealed with an O-ring, but there is no universal diameter. Drivers have taken to carrying adapter kits to handle the array of fueling equipment they'll encounter, said Zilberfarb. ""But we witnessed many incidents where the O-ring blew right off the probe.""  stations in Bangladesh tend to be undersized and inappropriately designed, with compressors that aren't up to the task. The equipment fails frequently, and many vehicles leave the station with their tanks only partially filled. Codes and standards were the subjects of talks in August between McGlinchey and Bangladesh officials including the Chief Inspector of Explosives, charged with enforcing safety codes pertaining to fueling stations. His advice was to ""look toward the future,"" and consider adopting international standards now in development at the United Nations or ISO 9000 standards from the International Organization for Standardization. The year's second mission to Bangladesh was in October, this time with the specific purpose of training. Thomason and Zilberfarb conducted a three-day course on CNG fueling station sizing and design. Attending the course were approximately 35 entrepreneurs and public officials. What they found most interesting, said Thomason, were discussions of fueling station design options, fuel, quality, and temperature compensation. Also covered were techniques for sizing critical station components, and strategies to reduce long lines of vehicles waiting to fill up. The October training was just a start, said Thomason. ""We plan to develop and implement a long-term selfsustaining program in which trainers in Bangladesh will be able to educate designers, construction companies, mechanics, and station operators about the critical elements of fueling station sizing, design, operation, and maintenance."" Accompanying the train-the-trainer campaign will be course curriculum development to facilitate skill transfer about building and equipping appropriate CNG fueling facilities.

The push to increase the number of CNG stations nationwide has resulted in perhaps 2,000 permits for new stations, said Zilberfarb. Many were granted to entrepreneurs with no experience in the design, installation, and maintenance of high-pressure fueling equipment.

The annual event is a showcase for vehicles powered by advanced technology and alternative fuels, with competition in performance, emissions, noise, and crash safety. This year's event drew greater participation by large trucks such as the Freightliner Century Class Day Cab trailer (foreground), as well as buses. A pleasant surprise this year, says the sponsor, was the ability of some commercialsize vehicles to achieve excellent results with zero emissions. Michelin  Hybrids lead Fuel Economy Guide ratings All three hybrid-powered passenger cars sold in the United States rank best in their classes for fuel economy, according to the ratings published by the federal government. The figures appeared in the 2004 edition of the Fuel Economy Guide, released in October by DOE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Honda's hybrid Insight and Civic, respectively, now top the two-seater and compact car categories. The Insight earned the best fuel economy status among all cars, rated at 60 mpg in city driving and 66 on the highway. The Toyota Prius, another hybrid, ranks best among mid-size cars. BMW's gasoline-fueled Mini-Cooper takes top honors in the category of mini-compact cars. Other category leaders include the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Focus Wagon, Ford Ranger, and two diesel-fueled Volkwagens--the Jetta Wagon and New Beetle--when equipped with five-speed manual transmissions. The guide rates vehicles for all available engine and transmission configurations. AFVs are grouped together among others of the same fuel-type. A special section provides information on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and lists the Honda FCX as only fuel cell vehicle certified for emissions by EPA. Print copies of the guide will be available at auto dealerships, credit unions, and public libraries nationwide. It is available in its entirety online at www.fueleconomy.gov.  General Motors recently unveiled a new diesel-electric hybrid drivetrain for use in transit buses, and simultaneously announced the purchase of 235 buses so-equipped in transit districts serving Seattle, Washington. Using the buses will save 750,000 gallons of fuel annually, say officials of the King County and Puget Sound transit agencies. The 60-foot articulated buses are made by New Flyer, and are driven by a parallel-hybrid system from GM Allison Electric Drives. Compared to the diesel-powered buses they are replacing in Seattle, the new buses produce 90 percent lower particulate emissions and 60 percent fewer emissions of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen, GM says. The buses deliver superior torque, with dual electric motors that launch the vehicle from a stop. Using hybrid drives in buses is part of a GM strategy to focus fuel-saving technology where it is needed most. Replacing a conventional bus with a hybrid saves as much fuel as replacing 40 passenger cars with hybrids, the company says. The new GM Allison  drive system is compatible with contemporary vehicle architecture, and can be used in non-articulated buses, suburban coaches, military vehicles, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The system is in pilot programs in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Portland, Houston, Salt Lake City; Austin, Texas; Hartford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; and Orange County, California.  12  General Motors/PIX 12861  Seattle adopts GM transit buses   Federal News On the Rise Trading of EPAct credits by State & Alternative Fuel Provider fleets has risen steadily along with their AFV acquisition rates A key feature of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 was the ramping up of its vehicle acquisition requirements. State & Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) fleets were mandated to gradually increase their annual AFV purchase rates, topping out at 90 percent for fuel providers and 75 percent for state fleets.  Credit Trading Activity 35 30 Number of Trades 25 20 15 10 5 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Credits Traded Trades 1,400 1,200 Credits Traded 1,000 800 600 400 200 0  EPAct also created a credit system to reward fleets that comply early or exceed their requirements. The system is designed for flexibility, allowing fleets with excess credits to sell them to others that fall short. Credit-trading has proliferated among S&FP fleets. It has ramped up in correlation with the required AFV acquisition rates. The table above outlines the steady ascent of credit trading since 1999. It would be too modest, however, to attribute the rise in credit trading strictly to escalating AFV requirements, says DOE Alternative Fuel Transportation Program regulatory manager Linda Bluestein. ""We're doing more to engage the fleet managers, to help them understand and meet their obligations."" Such help includes contacting fleets directly and publishing an annual report. Also provided are an ongoing newsletter for stakeholders, and updates to the S&FP section of the EPAct site at www.ott.doe.gov/epact/ state_fleets.shtml. Bluestein's office consults directly with fleet managers on matters of regulatory compliance. EPAct credits apply only to covered S&FP fleets, not to federal fleets. Nationwide, about 300 S&FP entities are affected. ""We get calls from corporate fleet managers and even private individuals saying, `I bought an AFV. Can I sell the credit to someone?' We tell them, `Not unless you're part of an eligible state or fuel provider fleet.'"" Independent brokers are allowed to facilitate trades if both parties are eligible. For most eligible fleets, credit selling isn't an everyday occurrence. ""Fleets that have exceeded their requirements usually bank their credits,"" says Bluestein. Credits can be saved up for use in future years, in case the fleet's AFV acquisition efforts don't make the grade in the future. Dozens of fleets have accumulated excess credits  in this fashion. Those interested in selling are listed at www.ott.doe.gov/epact/progs/public_rpt.cgi. Credit trading represents DOE's intent to be ""flexible"" in enforcing EPAct mandates, Bluestein says. ""Some fleets aren't in a position to comply as easily as others, maybe because a certain fuel isn't available locally or they can't arrive at exactly the right vehicle mix."" One fleet operator that has sold credits frequently is KeySpan Energy. The New York-based utility is one of the nation's largest distributors of natural gas. A company policy says its light-duty vehicle acquisitions must be limited to CNG vehicles. As a result, it typically accumulates hundreds of credits per year. KeySpan was involved in at least six trades in a one-year period ending in August 2003. The smallest was the sale of a single credit. The largest was the sale of a 332 credits to TXU Corporation, an investorowned, publicly traded utility based in Dallas. Credit selling is considered ""a way to help other utilities and state fleets meet their mandates,"" says Carolyn Mackin, a KeySpan employee who negotiates trades with buyers. It is also a welcome source of revenue. According to industry sources, trades have been negotiated in a range ""from the hundreds to the thousands"" of dollars per credit. Representing TXU in trades with KeySpan was John Matlack. That company has bought more than 450 credits (all from KeySpan) in the past three years. ""We've also directly acquired most types of AFVs including CNG, propane, electric vehicles, and even hybrids, and used them in our fleet where it made good sense,"" says Matlack. The company's compliance strategy also includes using biodiesel. Buying EPAct credits ""helps us meet our mandates in an economically feasible way,"" he says.  13   Clean Cities Roundup Other stakeholders include the cities of Lansing, East Lansing, St. John, and the St. John School District. Lansing leads the coalition, contracting with Wolfe, a retired mechanical engineer, to be its full-time coordinator. The September designation ceremony was attended by Douglas Faulkner, DOE Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. GLCCC/PIX 12862  Douglas Faulkner of DOE (standing, right) presents a plaque to Lansing Mayor Tony Benavides at the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition designation ceremony. Seated (from left) are Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey; Vincent Parish, Michigan Dept.of Agriculture; Bob Swanson, Michigan Dept. of Consumer and Industry Services; Doug Dittrich, General Motors; Jody Pollock, Michigan Corn Growers Association; and Jim Sygo, Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality.  Salt Lake coalition wins Clean School Bus USA grant The Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition was named one of 17 recipients of this year's Clean School Bus USA grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The $350,000 grant will help a large school district replace many of its oldest diesel-powered buses with CNG-fueled buses. The grant resulted from a community service project by students from the University of Utah. An application was drafted with guidance from coordinator Beverly Miller. Their approach was to ""tell a compelling story on the very first page of the proposal,"" says Miller. ""Give the readers a reason to want to read on, a reason to see just how you propose to do what the story says."" A CNG bus typically costs $35,000 more than a diesel bus--approximately $110,000 versus $75,000. The $350,000 grant amount will pay the incremental cost of 10 buses fueled by CNG. The buses will go to the Jordan School District, which already has 20 CNG buses obtained in large part with DOE support. Clean School Bus USA is a cost-shared grant program administered by EPA. Congress authorized $5 million of the agency's budget to assist school districts in upgrading their bus fleets. This year's grant competition drew more than 120 applications requesting nearly $60 million in funds. The chosen projects will demonstrate a variety of ways to reduce pollution from school buses, and will remove more than 200,000 pounds of diesel particulate matter from the air in the next 10 years, according to EPA.  New coalition takes root in Michigan The Clean Cities Program's newest coalition includes Michigan's capital city, Lansing, and other nearby communities. Stakeholders of the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition gathered for an official designation ceremony on the steps of the State Capitol in September. The Lansing-based group itself is not new, says coordinator Bill Wolfe. For seven years, members have worked to implement alternative fuels and AFVs in central Michigan. Approximately 135,000 gallons of non-petroleum fuels are sold annually in the area. Approximately half of the total is LPG. The other half consists mostly of biodiesel and a small amount of E85. After seeking Clean Cities status on two previous occasions, the group succeeded this year by demonstrating substantial local support for alternative fuels. Stakeholders of the coalition include car dealers, fuel suppliers, a utility company, a transit district, several state and local agencies, the American Lung Association, and Michigan State University. Lansing Community College, another stakeholder, offers an AFV technician degree program.  CNG Bookmobile Seattle's vehicle fleet includes more than 200 natural gas vehicles including, most recently, a CNG-fueled bookmobile. Operated by the Seattle Public Library, the bookmobile travels to daycare centers, retirement homes, and nursing facilities, bringing books to people who can't travel because of age, disability, or illness. Funding was provided in part by the Puget Sound Clean Cities Coalition, leveraging a grant from DOE's State Energy Program. With a John Deere natural gas engine installed on a chassis from Thomas Built Buses, the bookmobile is part of Seattle's Clean Green Fleet Action Plan, an initiative to implement alternative fuels and improve fuel economy in the city fleet.

In five years of involvement with the program, Russell-Story first helped lead Northeast Ohio's coalition to its Clean Cities designation in 1999, then became coordinator of a coalition serving the state of Vermont. As part of the honor, she was dispatched to this year's annual meeting of CIVITAS. (Europe's sweeping clean-transport initiative was profiled in the previous edition of AFN; visit http://afdcweb.nrel.gov/pdfs/afn7_2.pdf#civitas.) Following is Russell-Story's report from the October meeting, held in Graz, Austria. CIVITAS stands for CIty-VITAlity-Sustainability, and by definition it is much broader in scope than the Clean Cities Program. Partner cities in CIVITAS promote alternative fuels within larger program goals such as reducing the use of single-occupancy vehicles, expanding mass transit, and encouraging pedestrian and bicycle traffic in neighborhoods and urban centers. During my visit to Graz, that obvious difference between the two programs was pointed out to me by several CIVITAS coordinators. And in general, they expect their integrated approach to be more successful in addressing issues of air quality, petroleum dependence, and city livability. To me, the CIVITAS partner cities do seem to be experiencing tremendous success in AFV market penetrationespecially considering that the program has existed for only a few years. For example, Berlin has put more than 80 CNG taxis on the road in just two years. That's impressive progress toward a goal of 300 CNG taxis citywide. Germany already has 350 CNG fueling stations. Stockholm is the standout example in my opinion. The city has buses running on ethanol that's produced in Sweden. It also has an ambitious plan to make biogas from city wastewater. When that project is complete, the inner city ethanol buses will move to the suburbs while the new biogas buses go into use in the city center. While CIVITAS cities have some enviable successes, however, they are also experiencing challenges that may sound familiar. Rotterdam has had problems with prototype vehicles, and it now uses only more mature technologies. Rome remains committed to electric vehicles, but electric transit buses greatly outnumber privately owned EVs. Nantes and other cities have had difficulties persuading automakers to produce the kinds of vehicles that stakeholders want. Meanwhile, automakers attending the October conference expressed concerns about low AFV sales volume. Some CIVITAS participants are asking the European Commission to define alterative fuels and ""clean fuels,"" and to facilitate communication about product availability with the auto industry. Fuel neutrality is an issue within CIVITAS, as in Clean Cities. But some stakeholders believe Europe should focus on just one fuel. It was striking to see both the similarities and the differences between CIVITAS and Clean Cities. Erin Russell-Story I was equally impressed by the desire of CIVITAS partners to share their ideas, strategies, and experiences with their American counterparts. They urged me to take home the message of multi-modalism; expand Clean Cities to include all forms of transportation. But they were also very eager to learn about the use of AFVs in our country. Several CIVITAS coordinators hope to attend the 2004 Clean Cities Conference next May in Ft. Lauderdale. I urge Clean Cities stakeholders at our conference to seek out CIVITAS representatives and spend as much time with them as possible. I would also encourage DOE to remain in close contact with the European Commission, to jointly address issues facing both programs. Together, the two programs represent a much larger vehicle market. Thanks to DOE for the opportunity to represent Clean Cities abroad, and to learn more about Europe's impressive clean transportation initiative. Participants in both programs have a great deal to learn from each other. Air quality and petroleum dependence are global concerns, and creating a cross-Atlantic alliance may produce global solutions.

A demo of the vehicle was given to funding agencies and about 30 U.S. legislators. Billed as a ""low-emission shuttle bus of the future,"" it is expected to be manufactured with several optional engines. Natural gas fueling is planned, and other alternative fuels including propane, ethanol, and biodiesel are being considered. With the look and feel of traditional Yellowstone buses, the new vehicle design features ""theatre seating"" sloped downward from back to front. Seating options would accommodate 18 to 32 passengers. The floor is low for easy entry and exit, with a ramp to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A retractable roof would allow greater outdoor visibility. Snow tracks might be developed for winter mobility. Collaborating in its development are DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), the Federal Transit Administration, and the National Park Service. Strong support for the project comes from the Greater Yellowstone/Teton Clean Cities Coalition, which has an equally strong interest in clean transportation, according to coordinator Sharon Roh. The coalition encompasses parts of three states, with two national parks and several cities connected by interstate highway corridors. Prospects are good for use beyond Yellowstone, says INEEL project leader Kerry Klingler. ""While the development of the prototype is the result of a need by the National Park Service for a yearround transit vehicle that could be used for park operations, market analysis indicates the vehicle will have broad application in municipal transit and privatesector transportation as well.""
