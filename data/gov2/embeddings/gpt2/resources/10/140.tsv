GX261-71-6283039	"Vol. 149  WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, November 5, 2003  No. 159  Senate State me nt of S ena tor D iann e Fe instein ""On the Feinstein Amendment to H.R. 2673, the FY04 Agriculture Appropriations"" M rs. FE INS TE IN. M r. Pre siden t, this ame ndm ent has to do w ith providing some regulatory oversight ove r ener gy tradin g. It has to do w ith closing the En ron lo oph ole. It ha s to do w ith pro viding transp arenc y. Energy trades today are not subject to the 2 000 -passe d C omm odity M odern ization Act. Rathe r, these energy trades take place electro nically, take place in secre t, without transparency, with no reco rds ke pt, with no audit tra il available, and with no regulatory oversight to prevent fraud and manipulation in energy trading. I would like, first of all, from the De rivatives Stud y Cen ter, to ind icate and read a couple of paragraphs from the letter they have sent, which I think d efines the issue ve ry well. I quote: ""This regulatory assistance comes at a critical time. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Director of the Office of Market Oversight, `energy markets are in severe financial distress.' A long w ith the de cline in credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these m arkets. T his legislatio n will go a lo ng wa y to ad dress this pro blem ."" Then he defines what derivatives are. This is important for Memb ers to know. It is complicated. We went throu gh this on ce be fore. I w ould like to give you this definition because it is a good one: ""Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions, allowing investors to potentially take a large position in the market without committing an equivalent amount of capital. Moreover, derivatives trade d in ov er-the-co unter m arkets are devoid of the transparency that characterizes exchange-traded deriv atives, suc h as future s, and th is lack of transpare ncy introduce s a greater potential for abuse through fraud and m anipu lation."" That is exactly what happened. He goe s on to say: ""Derivatives are often combined into highly complex, structured transactions that are difficult, even for the seasoned securities trader and finance pro fessiona ls, to unde rstand and p rice in the mark et. Enron used such over-the-counter deriv atives ex tensively in o rder to hide the nature of their activities from investors. The failure of Enron and the demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a devastating impact on the level of trust in ene rgy ma rkets."" That is a good definition of what we are trying to do, why we are trying to do it, and what we are trying to involve. Now I would like to read into the Record a portion of a letter from Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer is the Attorney General of the State of New Y ork. That is the place where many of these cases are now coming to trial. He says: ""I firmly sup por t your effo rts to make energy markets competitive and protect those markets from fraud and m anipu lation. T he bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein, Levin, and Lugar, and under con sidera tion as a n ame ndm ent to the proposed 2004 agricultural appropriations bill, is a major step towa rd b oth go als."" He goes on to s ay: ""The amendment makes a major contribution to compe titive energy mark ets by initiating an elec tronic information system to be operated through the Federal Energy Reg ulatory C omm ission. T his system w ill prov ide o pen acce ss to com preh ensive , timely, and reliable wholesale electricity and transmission, price and supply data, greatly expanding the choices of both buyers and sellers. In addition, the reliability of market information would be markedly improved by the amendment's general prohibition on manipulation of the purchase or sale of electricity or the transm ission se rvices n eed ed to delive r electric ity, and b y spec ific prohibition of the round-trip trading man ipulatio n used so effec tively to inflate electricity prices to the pub lic's injury.""  1   This is a letter from the Attorney General of the State of New York. As such, it places an imprimatur of correctness, of need, and of value on the amendment that we introduce toda y. No w, wha t is in that ame ndm ent? Spe cifically, the am end men t would impr ove price transp arenc y in wholesale electricity markets. The amendment directs the Federal Ene rgy Re gulato ry Co mm ission to do j ust wha t M r. Spitz er said it wou ld do : to estab lish an ele ctron ic system to provide information about the price and availability of who lesale e lectricity to b uyers, to sellers, an d to the pub lic. Th is provision is actually similar to the transparency provision offered by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Dom enici, in the Energy bill. Sec ond ly, this legislation would prohib it round-trip electricity trades. W hat is a round-trip trade? It is the simultaneous buying and selling of the same quantity of electricity at the same price, in the same location, with no financial gain or loss. In other words, no commodity ever changes hands. Again, this is similar to a provision that Senator Domenici offered during consideration of the Energy b ill. Round-trip or wash trades are bogus trades. No electricity changes hands but the profits from the trades enrich the bottom line of a company's financial repo rt. In fact, I think we ha d on e com pan y-I believe it was CMS--say that 80 percent of their balance sheet in a given year was from bogus trad es. And there is nothing we can do abo ut it? D oes a nyone believ e that is right? I think not. I don't think the American peop le do, and that is one of the reasons these m arkets are so decimated. Next we would increase penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act  and the Natural Gas Act. Maximum fines for violations of the Federal Power Act would be increased from $5,0 00--tha t is nothing to a big company--to $1 million. And maximum sentences are increased from 2 to 5 years. Reme mber, these rip-offs were tremendous. Just look at the people plea-bargaining from Enron, look at what they did, look at the amounts of money they fraudulently compromised. This language is identical to section 209 of the Senate-passed Energy bill. Current fines are extraordinarily low and, therefore, provide no deterrence to illegal activity. W e also amend the Natural Gas Act to do essentially the same thing. Sena tor D ome nici, in his sub stitute electric ity title to the E nergy b ill, increased the fines in the Gas Act but he did not do so in the Federal Po wer A ct. W e wo uld d o bo th in this ame ndm ent. Ne xt the am end men t would pro hibit manipulation in elec tricity markets. Manipulation is prohibited in the wholesale electricity markets, and FERC is given discretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violators. Strangely enough, manipulation of energ y mark ets is not p rohib ited in curre nt law. C an you believ e that? M anipu lation o f energ y mark ets is not p rohib ited in cu rrent law . Th is would add language to Part 2 of the Fed eral P owe r Act to do ju st that. M ost imp ortan tly, this bill wou ld repeal the Enron exemption and allow the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which has oversight over virtually all other trading, to monitor the over-thecou nter en ergy m arket. This would repeal what happened in 2000 when Enro n pushed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act exemption for  large traders in energy com mod ities. And it would app ly antimanipulation and antifraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act to all over-thecounter trades in energy comm odities and d erivatives. In my view, when C ongress exempted energy from the Commodities Futures M ode rnizatio n Ac t of 20 00, it created the playing field for the western energy crisis of 2000 and 2001. The western energy crisis cost millions of people millions of dollars in my home State of California. So this is a charge I am making. W hen this Cong ress permitted the E nron loop hole to exist in the Commodities Mo dernization Act, they created the loophole for the playing field that Enr on an d oth ers use d to manipulate the western energy markets. Next, our bill would provide the Comm odity Futures Trading Commission the tools to monitor over-the-coun ter energy mark ets. Ov er-the-co unter e nergy tra de in energy commodities and derivatives performs a significant price discovery function, including trade on electronic trading facilities. Our amendment requires large, sophisticated traders to keep reco rds an d rep ort larg e trad es to the Commo dity Futures Trading Comm ission. This doesn't change the law. It only applies the law that exists for futures contracts to overthe-counter trades in energy markets. W e would limit the use of data. This requires the CFTC to seek the information that is necessary for the limited purpose of detecting and preventing manipulations in the futures and over-the-counter markets for energy, to keep pro prieta ry busin ess da ta confidential, except when used for  2   law enforcement purposes. This does not require the real-time publication of pro prieta ry data . It doe s not. This would have no effect on nonenergy commodities or deriv atives. T he am end men t would not alter or affect the regulation of futures markets, financial derivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated on page 20 the following: ""The amend ments by this title have no effect on the regulation of excluded comm odities under the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct."" In addition, we state: ""Th e am end men ts mad e by this title have no effect on the regulation of meta ls unde r the C omm odity Exc hang e Ac t."" Mr. President, my colleagues may be asking themse lves wh y I con tinue to press this cause. Here I note that Senator Levin has come to the floor. I want the Senate to know how helpful the Senator from Michigan has b een in w orkin g on this complicated issue. He has spent hour s and hour s of his time . His staff has worked with my staff in evolving this mea sure. W e have carefu lly vetted it. I believe we really know what we are doing here. The energy crisis in the W est demonstrated that, without Federal ove rsight, a b usiness b eco mes so lely concerned with its bottom line and not with any sense of ethical behavior; and arrests and convictions to da te have clearly d ocu men ted this to be the case. Californians are still paying the price of this unethical behavior. I make the point that we are not talking about one bad player in the C alifornia market. This goes way beyond Enr on. It ex tends to othe rs as we ll-to Reliant, Dynegy, Williams, AEP, CM S, El P aso M ercha nt Ene rgy, Duke, M irant, Coral, Sempra Energy  Trading--unfortunately, in my own State--Aquila, the City of Redding, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Pacificorps, and to the Puget Sound Ene rgy. W e believe California was duped out of $9 billion. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has illustrated its inability to refund California the money it is owed by recen tly recom men ding se ttlemen ts that in no way, shape, or form reflect the damage that was caused to both consumers and the economy of the largest State in the Union. In fact, FERC settled with Reliant on Aug ust 29 , allowe d them not to admit wrongdoing, and fined them $836,000. That was $836,000 for rules o f cond uct that co st the State $13 million--hardly fair. This disproportionately low fine gives credibility to the fact that the price one w ould have to pay in penalties, if caught manipulating the market, is worth the risk since the benefits of not getting caught far outweigh any penalty that may be lev ied up on a c omp any. I think it is pre tty clear tha t this disproportionately low fine gives credibility to the fact that the price one wo uld have to p ay in penalties, if caught manipulating in the market today, is worth the risk. There is no deterrence, since the benefits of not getting caught far outweigh any penalties that may be levied on a company. That is what we are trying to change. If I left any doubt in my colleague s' minds about the widespread manipulation that took place during the western energy crisis, let me poin t out som e rece nt exam ples o f a case that was brought by the Securities and Exchange Co mm ission ag ainst D avid Delaney, a former chief executive with two of the most prominent divisions of Enron. On October 30, 2002, Delaney pled  guilty to insider trading. The SEC brought charges against him for selling millions of dollars in Enron stock at a time he knew it was being manipulated. While these charges appear to be financial in nature, the underlying facts of the case were that En ron w as eng aged in manipulative b usiness practices, especially in California. In M arch o f 200 3, the F ER C staff repo rt on p rice m anipu lation in wester n mar kets: Inve stigators said they suspected Enron was using price inform ation o btaine d in regulated deals to manipulate trades in unregulated energy derivative markets. In one instance, Enron manipulated the price of physical gas, upward, then downward. Although the price change in the physical markets was only 10 ce nts per million B tus, Enron profited due to the effect that this small change in the physical price had on its large financial position. Enron earned more than $3 million in the unregulated overthe-counter markets, while losing only $ 86,0 00 o n the p hysical sa le of natural gas. I think it is important to note that the FER C repo rt also states: ""Enron's corporate culture fostered a disregard for the American energy customer. The success of the comp any's trading strategies, while temporary, demonstrates the need for explicit prohibitions on harmful and fraudulent market behavior and for aggressive market mon itoring a nd en force men t."" Th at is what w e are tryin g to pro vide in this ame ndm ent. T hat is what FERC says is missing. Our amendment would provide greater ove rsight over these markets so that fraudulent and manipulative behavior could be prevented. It would increase the penalties if, in fact, a company  3   engaged in fraudulent or man ipulative beha vior, an d it wou ld outlaw all types of manipulation including round -trip trading, wash trades, false reporting, churning, and deliberately withholding generation. All of the Enro n trading strategies, such as Ricochet, Death Star, Get Sho rty, Fat B oy, N on-F irm E xpo rt, Load Shift, Wheel Out, Black W idow , Red Co ngo, a nd C udd ly Bear: these are euphemisms for fraud and manipulation and our ame ndm ent wo uld co ver the m all. It is not clear to me why energy deriv atives ar e not re gulated while the Federal Government oversees some p hysical energy transactions. In other wo rds, if I buy natural gas, and it is delivered to me, then that transaction is overseen by FERC, which has the authority to ensure that this trans action is both transparent and reasonably priced. But a giant loophole is opened where there is no Go vernm ent ov ersight, when transac tions are carried out in electro nic exc hang es. As a result, if I sell natura l gas to yo u, and you sell it to som eon e else w ho se lls it to ano ther pe rson w ho the n sells it again, none of these transactions are covered by FERC or the CFTC. Because of that, what we saw in the wester n ener gy crisis is that this particular loophole allowed energy companies to manipulate prices and to escape any investigation or prosecution by any regulatory agen cy. Our amend ment will close the loophole, as Senator Levin said, created in 20 00 whe n Con gress passed the Commodities Futures M ode rnizatio n Ac t. The loop hole exempted energy trading from r egulato ry ove rsight, and it excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically. At the time, Enron was the main force beh ind ge tting this exe mptio n in this act. By closing this loophole, the amendment will prohibit fraud and  price manipulation in all over-thecou nter en ergy co mm odity transactions and provide the CFTC the auth ority it need s to inve stigate and prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation. Opp onents of this amendment have que stioned why we need to exp licitly give the C FT C this autho rity. The answe r is we ne ed to give the Commodities Futures Tr ading Co mm ission this a uthor ity because we learned during the western energy crisis that there was, in fact, pervasive manipulation and fraud in energy markets, and that FERC and the CFTC were either unable or unwilling to use the autho rity they had to interv ene. I think M r. De laney's plea barg ain is eloq uent testim ony to that. W e nee d to giv e the C FT C this authority because we need regulators to protect consumers and make sure they are not taken advantage of. We need to give the CFTC this authority because, when there are inade quate regulation s, consumers are ripped off. Let me be cle ar. O ur am end men t will pro vide th e sam e pro tection s to consumers in energy markets as these sa me c onsu mers have in all other commodity markets such as the N ew Y ork M ercha ntile Exchange or the Chicago Merchantile Exchange. Our amendment do es not provide more regulation or greater oversight than what currently exists for other commo dity markets, merely the same protections: Protections which are currently lacking. In fact, in an effort to avoid onerous or com plicated req uirements, Senator Levin, Senator Lugar, and I have worked together to make sure the recordkeeping and reporting requirements are very clear. Our ame ndm ent on ly requir es trad ers to keep records of over-the-counter trades in energy commo dities and derivatives that perform a significant price discovery function.  In other words, these are the trades that affect the pricing for everyone. The se are the big trade s, and these are the trade s where there ne eds to be transparency because they affect the ma rket. If I am a large c omp any and I sell you 1,000 decatherms of natural gas in a typical transaction on the spot market, this is a price discovery transaction because the prices of these transactions are usually covered and repo rted by the press and will affect prices of subsequent transactions. Trades on electro nic ma rkets ser ve, by the ir very nature, as price discovery function s. Th ey sho uld b e ava ilable for everyone to see because they will very likely influence what price the nex t trader will buy o r sell at in an open and transparent fashion. Our amend ment would require trade rs to ke ep re cord s of their trade s and to ma intain an a udit trail. Th is requ ireme nt wou ld simp ly regulate energy trading in the same way other finite commodities are handled. Why should pork bellies or frozen concentrated orange juice have more protection for consumers than ele ctricity? There is nothing in this amendment that should be burdensome for traders in any way. I would think responsible traders would already be keeping records and maintaining an audit trail for their own protection in this world. In fact, the amendment only allows the CFTC to seek inform ation to investiga te allegations of wrongdoing. W e have worked for almost 3 years to craft this provision. It has had hearings in the committee. It has bee n discu ssed o n the floo r. W e have met with dozens of people. W e understand there are those who do not want to support it. But in not supp orting it, wh at they are doin g is condoning a marketplace that has practiced deep fraud and deep manipulation and for the most part  4   gotten away w ith it. I don't think we do our job as Senators if we can't protect an unsuspecting public. As the Derivative C enter pointed out, these markets are in disarray now. Why are these markets in disarray? They are in disarray because people do not have confid ence in them. T hey are in disarray because there is no transparency because there are hidden markets, and when they explode, they explode big time. W hy should Mrs. Smith from Texas or Mr. Jones from Pennsylvania or M r. Co rnyn fro m T exas inv est in these markets? Why should he? He wouldn't have confidence in them. He would have no transparency. He would have no ability to know what is going on. W hat we are trying to do is put that confidence back in the marketplace by pr ovid ing som e pru den t, commonsense, antifraud, antimanipulation oversight by saying: If you trade this way, you must keep a record of the trade. You must keep an audit trail. And these trades must be transparent so that the Smiths, the Jone s, and the Co rnyns, if they so d esire, ca n find o ut what in fact is going on. Let me stress that this does not impact financial derivatives in any way whatsoever. We have clarified that. Our opponents persist in using the argument that financial derivatives are affected. They are not. Look at page 20, lines 17 to 20, if you want to see it in black and white. Nothing in this provision affects the authority of the Federal Ene rgy Re gulato ry Co mm ission. W e don 't change it in a ny way. To respo nd to concerns about trading platforms that only match buyers and sellers, there is no capital requirement. Let me repeat that because people are going around saying the re is. T o resp ond to concerns about trading platforms  that only match buye rs and sellers, there is no capita l requir eme nt. Bottom line: Our amendment merely gives back to the CFTC most of the authority it had before Co ngress passe d the C omm odity Future s Exc hang e Ac t. M r. Pre siden t, at this poin t I would like to read into the Reco rd a colloquy b etween the two lea ders, Senators Frist and Daschle, which mak es clea r the pa rame ters of this and why we are o n the floo r on this bill. If I may: ""Sen ator D aschle : M r. Pre siden t, Senator Feinstein has a market manipulation amendment that she was seeking a vote on. It is my understanding that the agricultural appropriations bill would be the appropriate bill for that amendment. I would inquire of the majority leader, should she offer her am end men t to that bill, wo uld she b e assur ed o f a vote o n or in relation to her amendment with no second-degree amendments, prior to such vote? ""The majority leader responds: The Demo cratic leader is correct. If Senator Feinstein offers her amendment to that bill, she will get a vote on o r in relatio n to it."" I just offer that to clarify the prese nt legal situa tion. I have stated in the Se nate nume rous tim es it is the du ty of this Congress to make sure our regula tors ha ve all the a uthor ity they need to prevent fraud and manipulation in the en ergy markets. Simply put, this is what our amend ment do es. Enr on re mains the pe rfect exa mple of ho w the syste ms we re so e asily gam ed. A fter En ron su ccess fully lobbied for an exemption to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000, they and others in the energy sector quickly took  advantage of this new freedom by trading energy derivatives absent any transparency and regulatory ove rsight. In o ther wo rds, in se cret. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron began to trade energy derivatives literally without being subject to proper regulatory oversight. Th at is how all these schem es cam e abo ut. Som e hotshot trad er, sitting in fro nt of his computer, found a way to evolve a strategy for the fraudulent and manipulative action of the marketplace. They let these various strategie s play o ut. Unlike the NASDA Q, from which timely electronic trade reports are available to the public, even prior to its transparency-enhanced reforms in 1997--in 1997, the NAS DAQ reformed itself to make their trad ers mo re trans pare nt-Enr onO nline d id no t offer time ly reporting of executions. This means Enr onO nline p rovid ed no data regarding recently executed transactions. Consequently, even after the trades, basic market inform ation w as no t prov ided to market pa rticipants. It should not surprise anyone that without basic transparency, without the ability to see what is happening, price s wou ld soa r. W hat intere sts me is the y did a nd yet the re is still resistance to this legislation. In 2 years, Enron's derivatives business had been a stand-alone company. It would have been the 256th largest company in America. That year, according to author Ro bert B ryce, E nron claime d it mad e mo re mo ney from its derivatives business, $7.23 billion, than Tyson made from selling chickens. That is huge, if you think abou t it. Think what that means. This segment of the market in one year made $7 billion and nobody knew how. No o ne knew what the trade s were . Th ey were all in secre t. Nothing was registered. There was no audit trail. There was no  5   antifraud, antimanipulation oversight. Boom. It happened. EnronO nline rapidly became the bigge st platfor m for e lectro nic energy trading. But unlike the regulated exchanges, such as the New Y ork Me rcantile Exchange, the Chicago M ercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade, Enr onO nline wa s not re gistered with the CFTC. So Enron set its own standards. In other words, it had a very secure, quiet, protected niche on the mark et. Othe rs have tried to replica te that. The banks, for example, Senator Levin said, devised something called the Intercontinental Ex change so they could do the same thing Enron has done. It is wrong. Traders and others in the energy sector came to rely on EnronOnline for pricing information. Yet the com pan y's contro l over th is inform ation a nd its ab ility to manipulate it was tremendous. As autho r Ro bert B ryce we nt on to describe--and this is very colorful and true--Enron did not just own the casino. On any given deal, Enron could be the house, the dealer, the oddsmaker, and the guy across the table you are trying to beat in diesel fuel futures, gas futures, or the California electricity market. You tell me that is a good situation? Yo u tell me th is Sena te and this Co ngress should let that hap pen . W e should not. That is just plain wrong. Th ose w ho wa nt to pr otect this secre t niche a re just d ead wron g. It is not in the Ame rican peo ple's interest to have a secret trading niche that can be an empire for fraud and manipulation. We need to protect consumers from future Enron-like scam s bec ause the y are go ing to happen. Now, was Enron and its energy derivative trading arm, Enron On line, the so le reaso n Ca lifornia and the W est had an ene rgy crisis?  Absolutely not. W as it a continuing factor to the crisis? I certain ly believ e that ev idenc e has sh own it was. Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization A ct , w hi ch to ok aw ay th e C FT C 's authority to investigate, we may never know for sure. In other word s, quite p urpo sely, this Congress, in 2000, let this secret world be created and said: ""We are go ing to take energy and metals out of the entire trading regulatory structure and we are going to let them go on op erating on their own, without the proper oversight. That is exactly what hap pen ed. It is jus t plain wr ong."" I repeat, once again, the amendment we o ffer will subj ect elec tronic exch ange s such a s Enr onO nline to the same oversight as other commo dity exchanges, such as the Chicago M ercantile Exchange, the New York M ercantile Exchange, and the Ch icago Bo ard o f Tra de-no more, no less. Without this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to investigate and prevent fraud and price manipulations since parties making the trade are not required to keep a record. This amendment is not going to do anything to change what happened in Califo rnia an d the W est. T hat is done. But it does provide the nece ssary au thority for the CF TC to protect other parts of this country against this kind of thing happening again. And it well could happen. Nobody thought we would ever see the kind of event that blacked out most of the East Coast and the Midwest, but we did. Nobody thought we would ever see what happened in the West, but we did. Nobody ever thought anybody would come up with schemes like ""Ricochet,"" ""Death Star,"" ""Get Shorty,"" ""Fat Boy,"" but they did.  No bod y thought they could use them to commit a manipulation of the market, but they did. I will leave you with one fact: The total co st of elec tricity in Califo rnia in 2000 was $7 b illion. The cost the next year was $28 billion. Does anyo ne be lieve tha t mark et force s-nam ely, supp ly and d ema nd--co uld accoun t for a 400-p ercent increase in the cost of electricity in a year? The answer has to be no. The answer has to be that bad things were done. So w e have work ed o n this amendment. I sit on the Energy Co mm ittee. I hav e tried to pay a great deal of attention to these matters, to follow this, and I am absolutely convinced that America and the business climate of America is much better off when things are transparent, when there are record s kept, when there is a regula tory auth ority that ca n say: W hoa. Something may be going haywire. Let's take a look at it. That is all we do--no mo re and no less than for any co mm odity. I wish to sa y one o ther thing . A financial derivative is not like an energ y deriva tive. Fo r peo ple to con fuse this an d say it affec ts financia l deriva tives is no t right. Ene rgy is a finite co mm odity. There is a beginning and there is an end, and it is different from a financial derivative. I believe the CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation oversight on futures exchanges but not on overthe-co unter e nergy tra des. T hat is the differe nce he re. W e wo uld cover over-the-counter energy trades and particularly those trades that are electronic. I also want to show where existing law is inadequa te. There is a ca se that has just been brought to my attention which I think shows that the existing law is inadequate, and this is what we are trying to fix.  6   Two ene rgy traders from the energy firms Dynegy and El Paso were charged by the U.S. Government with reporting false information on a numbe r of trades--at least 48 trades. They falsely reported the number and the prices used in trades they con duc ted inv olving natura l gas in an attempt to influence the natural gas spot price indices. The Federal indictment charged them, a mon g othe r matter s, with wire fraud and violation of the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct, which is what w e are ta lking ab out, provisions prohibiting price manipulation and dissemination of false information about energy comm odity rates. The Fed eral court allowed the wire fraud charges, but it dismissed the Commodity Exchange Act charges on the ground that the wording of the act failed to prohibit persons from knowingly pro viding false information. While the CEA used the word ``knowingly'' in an earlier part of the provision, the court ruled that the w ord had to be re pea ted in the section pro hibiting false information. Th e Fein stein-Lug ar-Lev in amendment would clarify the word ing of the CE A pr ovisio n to resolve the problem identified by this Federal district court in the case of the United States of America v. Michelle Valencia, Criminal Action No. 8-03-024. That is a pretty clear indication of where present law is not adequate. The se were bo gus trades. T hese trades never took place. There were totally bo gus, and yet the wo rding in the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct, which we are trying to fix, was judg ed b y the co urt as too vague to take any action. Sec ond , I want to make this poin t: W hat we are trying to do is prevent fraud and manipulation. We are  trying to prevent it and deter it from happening. The soft penalties we have now don't prevent it. That should be very clear. We toughen the penalties in the Electricity Act and in the N ationa l Gas Act. Clearly, a number of these schemes that Enron practiced, whether it was ""Death Star,"" ""Ricochet,"" or ""Black W idow,"" or any of these other terrible schemes, took place. Our bill would specifically prevent them. W e are trying to prevent and deter, and the way we do that is by strengthening the law. I am really puzzled by the administration's position. I am really pu zzled beca use it seem s to me they should be on the side of the American people, not on the side of the trad ers and those w ho wa nt to get rich quick from this open marketplace. Additionally, it is interesting to me that the President's working group, when it came out in 1999, specifically said: ""Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial com mod ities with finite sup plies""-that is energy""however, the work ing gro up is un animo usly reco mm end ing that the exclusio n""-the exclusion from the bill""not be extended to agreements involving such c omm odities ."" So beginning in the year 2000, they have done a total switch and I do not un dersta nd wh y, particu larly after the events of 2000 and 2001, where we know fraud and manipulation was explicit. Now when the Government tries to go after two comp anies for bogus trades, a court finds the Co mm odities Exc hang e Ac t is inadequate; it is vague. W hy would people oppose what we are trying to do? I think we are on the side of the angels.  Let me quickly go over some poin ts. W hy do we ne ed this legislation? W e need it bec ause com pan ies are n ow p ermitted to trade large a mou nts of en ergy in virtually unregulated marke ts, which makes it easier for unscrupulous companies such as Enron to manipulate the price of energy. The bill would close the Enr on lo oph ole tha t allows this unregulated trading. Secondly, do we have any exam ples o f how the se ma rkets have been manipulated? FERC recently released a 1-inch thick report on how the markets for electricity and natural gas in the western United States were manipulated in 2000 and 2001. So we know it happened. The FERC found Enron and other companies lied abou t the prices of their trades, reported fictitious trades to drive up prices, did wash trades with each other, and engaged in rapid trading to drive prices up and then back down, reaping millions of dollars of profits in the process and costing custo mers billions o f dollar s in unjustified energ y costs. T hat is accord ing to FER C. Th at is a finding in their stud y. Yet p eop le still oppose this legislation. Unbelievable. W ould this legislation have prevented these manipu lations? Un der c urren t law, the C FT C is totally in the dark about what goes on in the over-the-co unter marke ts. Under this legislation, manipulation in these markets would be a felony and the CF TC would get rep orts about large trades in the over-thecounter markets, so it would be able to mo nitor these marke ts, som ething it ca nnot d o no w. Sho uld anybody be able to escape from ongoing monitoring of what they do in these markets, big traders? I do not think so. Y et they are in this little loophole that was created. That was the purpose of the loophole, to prevent anybody from looking; keep no reco rds.  7   Therefore, they are not going to be able to catch us, and there will be a weak law so it will not be sustained in court when they try to bring a case. Ano ther qu estion: E nron is bank rupt. A number of traders have been fined and energy trading is back on the rise. The marketplace seems to be corr ecting itse lf. W hy is this legislation needed? It is needed to avoid more problems like we have just had. Although everything mentioned in the question I just asked may be true, there is one other significant fact. The consumers and businesses that paid higher price s have only rec ove red a small fraction of their lo sses. It is be tter to prevent the manipulation and the losses fro m hap pen ing than try to make up for them after they take place. That is the point. What our agencies have shown is there is, up to this point at least, no way for an aggrie ved mark etplac e to rec ove r its losses from fraud and any manipulation. Therefore, it should be our jo b to se e the law s are ac curate and in place to prevent this kind of activity from taking place in the beginning. That is where increasing the penalties comes in. Imagine, a $2,000 penalty for doing this. That is nothing. That is not even a slap on the wrist for multibillion-dollar com panies. How d oes one respond to the con cerns that this legislatio n will increase costs and uncertainty and scare off investment in the energy markets? It will not. The regulated U.S. co mmo dities markets are the most successful and reliable in the world. Ever since the agricultural exchanges were first regulated, we have heard dire predictions from commodities traders that regulation will drive busine ss ove rseas. In fact, the opposite has happened. W e have seen a flight to quality as investors seek safe and reliable markets. That is a fact. T his help s the ma rket.  Many traders and energy comp anies have said the a ctual cost of compliance with this legislation will be m inimal. Th e final qu estion: W hy shou ld energy derivatives be regulated differently or more stringently than financial derivatives? Because we do no t touch financial derivatives. M r. Gre ensp an, ple ase kn ow tha t. The price of energy derivatives can be manipulated by manipulating the supply of the underlying energy commodity. The price of financial deriv atives is ve ry difficult to man ipulate beca use it is difficult to manipulate the price of financial measures underlying the instruments, which generally are not commodities but abstract financial measures such as interest rates and curre ncy exchang e rates. T he n a ga in , in 19 99 , th e P re sid en t's working group saw this. They recommend ed they not put energy into the looph ole. The Cong ress saw d ifferently and put en ergy into this loophole, and the never-never land of secrec y went on. T hese bogus trad es were ena bled. T hese bogus trades took place. There are cases being brought, and we are even find ing that the law is inade qua te bec ause a cour t has said it is too va gue. W e cor rect tha t. I think this is really an important ame ndm ent. I do not think I cou ld live with m yself if I did no t try to do it. If we lose to day, b elieve m e, I will come back again and again, because we saw what happened. W e know there was massive fraud and manipulation. We know the loophole was there. We know there is no transparency, no record, no audit trail, and no antifraud and antimanipulation oversight for any over-the-counter energy trade. That is what we are trying to do. M y collea gues h ave re ferred to futures exchanges rather than over-  the-counter energy trades, and that is what we are refe rring to in this bill. Please, I know back here people look at the West and they say, aha, it is not us, but what I say to them is some day it could be them. Do they not want the law right? Do they not want to be pro tected ? D o they n ot wan t a record kept so the regulatory agency can look at it? I really hope the answ er is yes, an d I ho pe this Sena te will vote for this ame ndm ent. This is a report entitled ``The O verthe-Co unter D erivative s M arket in th e C om mo di ty E xc ha ng e A ct '' which was written by the President's working group on financial markets in 1999. On page 16 of that report, it goes on to say--and I want to read it in its conte xt: ""Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial commodities with finite supplies""  which energy would be one  ""the work ing gro up is un animo usly reco mm end ing that the exclusio n""-In other words, the loophole-- ""not be ex tende d to a greem ents involving such commodities. For example, in the case of agricultural com mod ities, pro duc tion is seasonal and volatile and the unde rlying co mm odity is perishable, factors that make the mark ets for the se pro duc ts susceptible to supply and pricing distortions and to manipulation. Th ere ha ve also been severa l well known efforts to manipulate the prices of certain metals by attempting to corner the cash or futures markets. M oreov er, the cash market for many nonfinancial commo dities is dependent on the futures m arket fo r price disco very. Th e CF TC , howe ver, sho uld reta in its authority to grant exemptions for derivatives involving nonfinancial commodities as it did in 1993 for energy products, where exemptions are in the public interest and  8   otherwise consistent with the Co mm odities Exc hang e Ac t."" Then the loophole was promulgated. The section of the Commodities Exchange Act which contains that loophole is section 2(g) and is titled, ""Excluded Swap T ransactions."" The section read s: ""No provision of this Act (other than section 5a (to the exte nt pro vided in sections 5a(g)), 5b, 5d, or 12(e)(2) shall apply to or govern any agree men t, contra ct or tra nsactio n in a commodity other than an agricu ltural co mm odity if ag reem ent, contract or transaction is......""And then it goes on. This section in the Commodities Exchange Act is what creates the loophole, and that is the problem that we a re trying to corre ct in this legislation. I believe we do correct it. Again, it is very hard for me--and this migh t have so methin g to do with the fact we went thorough it in the W est--to und erstand why we would not want to deter this activity and strengthen the rules to prohibit such manipulation from happening in the future. W e wan t to be v ery cer tain that with all of this kind of trading, including over the counter trades and electronic trades, that the records are kep t and the re is an a udit trail cle arly exists and there is an opportunity for the Commo dity Futures Trading Commission to note something may be wrong and hold the proper investigation. This is no more and no less than what exists on the exchange toda y. Why should this secret world of trading be allowed to exist? I know peo ple ge t rich thro ugh it. T his secre t trading world allows p eop le to get rich by engaging in fraudulent trades, as was seen during the Western energy crisis. It is this type of manipulative behavior that we are  trying to stop. I can't understand why the adm inistration would not wa nt to support this. When M r. Greenspan came in and talked to me a few years ago when we first proposed this legislation, his main concern was finan cial de rivatives . Th is is why we mad e certa in, as I hav e said in my co mm ents, that this legislation does not concern financia l deriva tives. H e ma y well have expanded his view to all kinds of over-the-counter trades since then, but at the time I sat down and met with him, that w as no t his position. Regardless, we are talking about public policy. We are talking about protecting the people of America. W e are talking about strengthening the law so that what happened on the wes t coast c an nev er hap pen in the Midwest or on the east coast or any part of the nation. I mentioned what the Attorney Ge neral o f the State of N ew Y ork-the Atto rney G enera l, not a d epu ty-Mr. Spitzer, has written. Once again, let me read what he said. He is the one who prosecutes many of these c ases an d I rea lly think his views in this area should make a difference. He says: ""I urge your amendment's adoption. In ad dition to pro viding whole sale electricity markets, the transparency vital to effective competition, the amendment closes loopholes used to manipulate energy markets. It improves the ability to detect fraud and other m anipu lation, an d it deters manipulation by establishing substa ntive p enalties."" This is the Attorney General of the State o f New Yo rk who is going to be pro secuting many o f these cases. He says it is a wise thin g to do , it is a prudent thing to do, and you shou ld do it. He also says that this amendment  mak es a m ajor contrib ution to competitive energy markets by initiating an electronic information system to be operated through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I have already talked abo ut this. Ea rlier, I said how th is legislation will provide op en access to comprehensive, timely, and reliable wholesale electricity and transmission prices. The attorney general rep eats that. He says: ""The reliability of market inform ation w ould be m arked ly impr ove d by the ame ndm ent's""-Do n't we wan t that? I thin k so-""general prohibition on manipulation of the purchase or sale of electricity, or the transm ission se rvices n eed ed to deliver electricity and by the specific prohibition of the round trip trading manip ulation used so effectively to inflate elec tricity price s to the p ublic's injur y. This is the prosecutor in one of the main S tates that w ould have th is kind of litigation. Then he goes on to say: ""Enforcement of the law and regulation safeguarding our energy markets would be greatly aided by other reforms the amendment pro vides . Th e am end men t would repeal the so-called Enron exemption which shields large energ y trade rs from over sight."" Once again, I want to iterate that this is the Attorney General of New York speaking. ""In ad dition, the ame ndm ent wo uld app ly to anti-ma nipula tion an d antifraud pro visions o f the Co mm odity Exc hang e Ac t""-- I just rea d this pro vision to you  ""Clea rly this section of the Act is inadequate by anyb ody's rea ding to effectively regula te all ene rgy transa ctions."" Our legislation would improve the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ability to addre ss  9   complaints, and it would lift the restriction on the Federal Energy Reg ulatory C omm ission's autho rity to ord er refun ds. T hese re form s will make accountable parties, which are currently beyond the law's reach acco untab le for the ir action s and will increase reco very of overc harges. On ce ag ain, I ask, d on't we wa nt to do this? Do we really want to protect these people who are willing to do such harmful things to the American people? I a m s ho ck ed at th e a dm in ist ra tio n's letter. I tho ught the y were th ere to protect the public. M adam Presiden t, there really is a differen ce of o pinio n here . I would like to have the time to read part of the transcript in a hearing on the Co mm ittee on A gricultur e on J uly 10. A question that Senator Crapo asks to Mr. Newsome of the CFTC. ""Senator Crapo: I know we have bee n ove r this befo re bu t I want to be sure that I have it right. As I listened to the testimony of both of you it see ms to m e that ther e is actually a lot more agreement than disagreement with respect to what we ought to be doing and where we ought to be . The d isagreemen t, as I understand it, is over whether 2G excludes from the fraud and manipulation provision swap transactions. ""Now, swap transactions are  the dominant majority of what goes ove r the ov er-the-co unter m arket. ""I am correct about that. W ould the two of you agree that is the core of the disagreement between your testimo ny? ""Mr. Newsome: 2G certainly does exclud e swap transac tions."" Th at is my p oint. An d he is testifying to it in this committee that this is not  covered by the CFT C. It goes on. ""Senator Crapo: It excludes them from fraud and manipulation protections. ""Mr. Newsome: 2G excludes them from jurisdic tions o f the CF TC ."" The P RESID ING OFFIC ER. T he Senator's time has expired. Mrs. FEIN STE IN. I thank the chair.  10"

SUMMARY Ninety three frogs were submitted for evaluation. Frog malformations were classified into 6 major categories and 12 subcategories based on necropsy observations of 72 frogs (Appendix J) and the findings of radiographs performed on 69 of thes e 72 frog s (App endix D ). All of the pr imar y ma lform ations in fro gs from Verm ont w ere relativ ely uniform, involved missing or incomplete limbs, which is quite different from frog malformations found in other states wh ere ou r lab has co nduc ted studies . Unlike malfo rma tions in 3 oth er states (19 97 and 1998 Nation al W ildlife Health Center data), Vermont frogs collected in 1997 were unique in having no multiple limbs, no phocomelia or complete but extremely abnormal limbs, no pure rotational/skin web malformations, and only one frog with a possible craniofacial malformation. It was interesting that, on the average, all malformed frogs from all Vermont sites were in poor to emaciated body condition without discrimination by site or malformation type (Appendix F, Tab les #1 and #2). Ag ain, this wa s not our finding in o ther states. R adiogr aphs w ere extr eme ly helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of abnormal termination in both long bones and digits. Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from malfo rma tion, althou gh nec ropsy observ ations an d histopa thology were also imp ortant in ru ling out trau ma. Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix G). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristic types of microscopic change seen at the termination of the malfo rme d limb was v ery diso rganiz ed and hyper plastic cartilag e that wa s not ossifyin g norm ally and inte rfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change seen at the point of termination was the formation of sma ll nests of end osteal type cartilage m atrix w ith som e orga nization b ut no ob vious m aturation or ossification . None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development at the term inal end. T raum atic am putation s did hav e micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. There were no microscopic changes in internal organs that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. Virology cultures were conducted on 51 tissues on 2 different cell lines adapted for amphibians and electron microscopy was performed on selected homogenates of frog tissues to determine if viruses were present. No viruses were isolated or identified in any Vermont frogs. Bacterial cultures were performed on 44 tissues and 98 bacteria were isolated and identified. There did not appear to be any direct association between bacterial isolates and the observed malformations. Parasitologic examinations were conducted on 14 frogs. Although the parasitology sample size was small, no association could be found between the presen ce of m etacerc aria and the occu rrenc e of m alform ations.  5   II.  BACKGROUND  During the summer of 1995, a group of school children conducting a wetland nature study observed a high rate of abnormal leopard frogs in Henderson County, Minnesota. Since 1995, occurrence of deformed frogs have been reported in 42 states and 3 Canadian provinces (Gilbertson). The species reported have included northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), spring peeper (Hyla crucifer), American toad (Bufo americanus), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana ), wood frog (Rana sylvatica ), green frog (Rana clamitans), pickerel frog (Ran a palustris ), and mink frog (Ran a septen trionalis ). Studies, funded by the USGS Biological Resource Division's Eastern Region in coordination with the Vermont Age ncy of N atural R esour ces, and the U.S . Fish an d W ildlife Serv ice, we re initiated thr ough the Na tional W ildlife Health Center in the summer of 1997. The objectives of the study were to characterize frog abnormalities, document the distribu tion of m alform ed frog s, determ ine the freq uency of ma lform ations, collec t baseline m orph om etric measurement of frogs, and collect water and sediment samples for analysis. The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) was requested to assist in defining the developmental problems in Vermont frogs. The role of the NWHC was to perform diagnostic assessments of abnormal and normal frogs from Vermont sites that were known to have malformed frogs. The diagnostic evaluation included gross necropsy examination, histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology. In the spring of 1998 funding became available to perform radiology on a subset of the Ver mo nt frogs. A report of preliminary findings was presented at the NIH/NIEHS Workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health held December 4-5, 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The data we presented at the conference made it clear that teratogenesis was occurring in tadpoles of the northern leopard frog. Factors that have been shown in the lab to cause teratogenesis are numerous falling into the general categories of genetic or environmental. Some environmental factors that can influence development are; chemical, thermal, infectious, or trauma-related factors such as UV radiation which can cause cell damage. Tadpoles are free-living postembryonic organisms that achieve all of their intricate developmental milestones without the pro tection of a sh ell or uteru s. The en vironm ent in w hich thes e tadpo les deve lop is com plex an d dyn amic . Sorting out the significant physical and chemical (molecular) factors that are contributing to teratogenesis in the frogs from those facto rs that are c oincide ntally pre sent in the en vironm ent with out direc t effect is impo rtant. M alform ations can indicate a ge neral tim e fram e durin g wh ich factor s are influe ncing th e teratog enic pro cess. Knowledge of the possible developmental stages that have incorporated an error can provide guidance in choosing appropriate times for collecting field samples for chemical analysis and guide researches in developing bioassays that mimic the timing of factors present in the field. Careful characterization and categorization of malformations occurring in the frogs can provide clues to potential causes through comparison with similar malformations that have been produced in lab experiments. Some of these laboratory experiments involving development date back as far as 1929 (Vogt). However, associations based on morphologic evidence are circumstantial and without further field and lab analy ses, con clusions canno t be draw n rega rding th e cause s of ma lform ations. To determine the causes of malformations, agents will need to be identified in the field at appropriate developmental times, and in the appropriate geographic locations in relation to occurrence of malformations. The agents must be capab le of consiste ntly pro ducing com parab le lesions in ap prop riate spec ies of frogs . Lab ex perim ents w ill need to take into consideration the role played by such variables as timing of exposure, dose and duration of exposure, and interactions between other environmental or host factors in the potential for producing the wide range of malfo rma tions seen in the field. La borato ry resu lts will need to be repr oduc ible und er field con ditions.  6   III. DEFINING THE PROBLEM The pathology of many of malformed frogs is obvious, the cause is not. Syndromes like these ha ve not be en clear ly defined in frogs an d even the directio n to look fo r answ ers is unde r deba te. Thes e chan ges are not prod uced b y a sudd en and catastrop hic insult. Malformations represent the end point in a developmental process that incorporated an error long befo re the ex ternal m anifestation of patholo gy. W hat are the errors in development and what questions can we ask to clarify the possible causes of these errors?  A. M orph ogen esis Fro m the time an egg is fertilized , an intricate r elationsh ip exists betw een cells an d cell 14897-011 layers w hich giv es rise to ver y orga nized an d highly specialized tissues. Th is proce ss is called morphogenesis. Morphogenesis occurs through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Cells divide and proliferate following well defined maps as they move and fold, becoming more differentiated and specialized. As cell layers interrelate to each other they profoundly influence the growth and character of cells around them. The timing of this intercellular communication is critical and is thought to be carried out primarily by chemical signals that affect gen etic expr ession.  In limb bud formation, the mesoderm carries all of the information needed to induce a limb as it interacts with the overlying ectoderm. If the lateral mesodermal plate, represented in this figure, is su rgically tra nsplan ted onto the back of a tadpole, an entire limb will form in response to that committed mesoderm. During later morphogenesis of the limb the mesoderm is responsible for directing bone formation and the ectoderm is responsible for prov iding the ce llular env ironm ent that allow s the limb to continu e to grow . B. Malformation vs. Deformation If something goes wrong during morphogenesis and an error occurs in the sequence of cell division, cell migration, cell differentiation or programmed cell death, pathology is likely. This pathology is called a malformation or a deformation. Malformations represent primary errors in development; deformations arise later in development and usually result from mechanical factors. Timing of the error or insult influences both the occurrence and the type of malformation produced. And the appearance of the malformation can indicate timing. For example, if the malfo rma tion is an inco mp lete orga n, the factor or insult m ust have occur red du ring a su sceptible p eriod p rior to com plete form ation of that o rgan to halting dev elopm ent. C. Teratog enesis Teratogenesis is simply the name given to the abnormal development that results in malformations. These errors can involve any level of organ formation; cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Teratogenesis can be caused by either genetic or environmental factors (intra-uterine factors in mammals). Examples of environmental factors include radiation, hyperthermia, low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, poor nutrition and chemicals. Factors or compounds causing malfo rma tions are c alled terato gens.  7   The same teratogen presented at different developmental ages can initiate different malformations. However, different teratogens presented at the same developmental age can res ult in similar errors in develo pm ent caus ing the sam e ma lform ation.  IV. FINDINGS A. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FROGS WITH SIMILAR MALFORMATIONS Du ring July and S eptem ber 19 97, 93 r ecently m etam orph osed leo pard fr ogs w ere sub mitted to the Na tional W ildlife Health Center (NW HC) for diagnostic evaluation. Frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune (12 abnormal and 6 norm al), Lap ans B ay (14 ab norm al and 6 n orm al), M issisquoi N W R (15 abnor mal an d 6 nor mal), M ud C reek (6 normals), Poultney River (21 abnormal and 7 normal) and shipped, alive, to the NWHC . Diagnostic methods and proce dures are detailed in the study plan (A ppen dix B). Necropsy evaluations did not reveal developmental abnormalities in the internal organs of the frogs, although there were renal flukes (most likely Echinostomatae) in various stages of development and inflammation of the cloaca was occasionally seen. The most common primary abnormalities in these frogs involved the rear legs and examples of these limbs with radiographic detail of the bone changes provide information that assists in classification of the patholo gy as m alform ations or deform ations.  1. Deformations a. Trauma Ver y few frogs sub mitted w ere con vincing deform ities or traum a. Aga in, defor mities ar e not prim ary err ors in development but structural abnormalities that can be caused by mechanical forces, trauma, infectious agents or inflammation. Gross observations of northern leopard frog 14895-003 from Poultney River indicated a short femur on one side suggesting a malformation. Radiographs, however, show us that the femur actually has a overriding fracture which is a deformity caused by trauma. Although frog 14897-003 from Missisquoi is missing a limb, the changes in this limb are consistent with trauma and not a primary error in development. Characteristic changes associated with trauma include an abrupt end to the leg associated with an irregular depre ssed cen ter and r ed, inflam ed, raised mar gins. M icrosco pic examination of leg of the frog shown at right (14897-003) showed hem orrha ge, inflam matio n and ac ute necr osis of the sk eletal mu scle surro undin g the end of the fem ur. N o radio graph s wer e availab le from this frog as the limb w as section ed for m icrosco pic evalu ation. 14897-003 Two of the frogs (14896-008, 14897-003) were in fair body condition suggesting recent trauma. Frogs 14897-013 and 14895-003 were in poor body condition suggesting a more chronic condition.

Malformations The limb abnormalities seen in the Vermont study that represent primary errors in development follow and include; com plete or p artially m issing lim bs, rotation of long bo nes, and skin we bbing . a. Am elia This fro g is missin g a limb . This is a ver y early p rima ry erro r in deve lopm ent. If we look at the radiograph of one of these frogs with amelia (below 14895-015) we see that not only is the right leg missing, but the right acetabulum (joint for the femur) of the hip also never developed and the two bones (ischium and pubis) are absent. The hip and hip joint on the opposite side with a normal limb are unremarkable. There is no evidence of inflammation, fractures or vestigial bones in the regions where the right leg should be. The limb never developed. 14895-002 Where are the errors in development? The lateral mesodermal plate is responsible for the pelvic development as well as initiating the development of the rear limb. The lateral mesodermal plate must have been present, as evidenced by the presence of at least a portion of the pelvis on the affected side. However, there must have been a very early error because 2 of the 3 pelvic bones nev er developed. A pparent lack of initiation of a limb also suggests an early primary error in the formation of the limb with either an error in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge or in communication between the mesoderm and ectode rm.  Radiographs of three frogs with completely missing limbs showed two types of changes. Two of the frogs radiographed were 14895-015 missing the ischium and the pubis of the pelvis only on the side witho ut the limb , as in the rad iograp h show n abov e. The other ra diogra phed frog w ith ame lia had all of the p elvic elem ents pre sent. Frogs with amelia were emaciated.

Hem imelia Tru ncation of the limb sugge sts an erro r prior to the com pletion of lim b deve lopm ent but an error th at prob ably occur red later in develo pm ent than tho se erro rs occu rring in fr ogs w ith ame lia. Frog 14896-003 from Alburg Dune does not have the characteristic changes expected in a traumatized limb. There is no swelling, redness, inflammation, or irregularity at the termination of these limbs. There is no scarring and the pigm entation o ver the e nd of the lim b is norm al. Radiographs of these limbs show no fractures in the segment of femu r that rem ains and the term ination is blun t. Frogs with hemimelia have truncated limbs but the proximal segment of limb that is present is relatively normal. This is one of 2 types of bone changes seen radiographically in association with truncation of 14896-003 bone s (hem imelia). If we look at these two radiographs, we see 14896-014 had an abrup t termin ation of the fe mu r witho ut bone reaction similar to that seen in 14896-003. In the radiograph of 14895-013, however, the distal femur has very abnormal bone development at the end of the bon e with irr egular widen ing of the b one silho uette and increased lacy bone trabeculae traversing the marrow. There is no attem pt at bone develo pm ent bey ond this ab norm al bone . The bone changes in 14895-013 suggest that there was an error at the pro gress zo ne; w ith mes oderm al signals; or with comm unication between the ectoderm and mesoderm which eventually stopped growth but may not have stopped as abruptly as 14896-013 14896-014 in 14896-003. The bone development apparently lost its control and became very irregular abnormal fashion in 14895-013 but it did continue to produce bone. In 14896-003 and 014, we see no irregular bone growth at the termination, the bone just ends su ggesting a mo re abru pt halt to dev elopm ent. Microscopically, the proliferative bone changes as seen in 14895-013 confirmed thick, partially ossified trabeculae traversing the marrow w ith irregular and thickened cortices whic h we re som etimes bent at the po int of abno rma l develop men t.

Abnor ma l feet or m issing digits (Ectrodactyly or Brachydactyly) Frog 14895-008 from Poultney River has a short limb and, although difficult to recognize, this disorg anized limb en ds with a structur e resem bling a foo t. The radiog raph o f this frog sho ws tha t not only is the grow th abno rma l but differen tiation of the bo nes is abn orm al as we ll. There appears to be abnormal development of the distal tibiafibula and there was 180/ rotation of the tibiafibula that resulted in the tibiale bone in a lateral position and the fibulare bone in medial location. The tibiale and fibulare are short. The digit positions are also reversed 180/ (they are aligned in the appropriate order relative to the tibiale and fibulare bones) and phalanges. These malformations suggests an error in the mesoderm that may ed later in the develo pm ental sequ ence re sulting in ab norm al skeletal elem ents limb only.  14895-008 are missing have o ccurr in the distal  14895-008  Another example of abnormal development of the feet can be seen in the radiograph of frog 1489 5-18.

Rotation of long bones and skin webbing The radiograph of the Vermont frog shown (14895-010), although missing the distal limb on one side has rotation of the lower limb of the more normal leg with a bend in the bone that is traversed by a ""bone bridge"". Rotational abnormalities in the Minnesota frogs were very common. These rotational abnormalities involved the limb proximal to the hock causing the flexed hock to have either a dorsal or ventral orientation rather than pointing in the more normal medial direction. Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations . Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs). L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition. The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis. Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent. Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length. The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated. B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly). Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb. Of the 61 malformations, (4 were bilateral) 10% had no limb on one side, 40% involved abrupt termination of either the femur, tibiafibula or tibiale and fibu lare and 43% had loss o r trunca tion of the dig its.  13   Fro gs from Miss isquoi ha d the m ost com plete limb develo pm ent with truncatio ns involv ing the low er limb distal to the femur. Frogs from Poultney River and Alburg Dune (although fewer number of total frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune) had the most severe truncations with the primary abnormalities involving apparent lack of any initiation of lim b (am elia) or trun cation of the limb at the fe mu r (fem oral hem imelia). A verag e body condition in frogs from all of the study sites was poor to emaciated. Frogs with no apparent malformations (controls) collected at the study sites also we re in poo r to fair bod y cond ition but the sa mp le size wa s too sm all to mak e an extr apolation to the overall population of leopard frogs at these sites. Lapans Bay had rear limb malformations primarily involving the tibiafibula a nd the foo t. This ch art of association of severity of malformation with site of collection might suggest errors occurring either at different developmental stages in frog development, or different dose or duration of exposure to a teratogen. 1.

Frogs from this site represented 50% of all Vermont frogs submitted with no obvious limb development (amelia) on one side, and 45% of all long bone hemimelia (femur or tibiafibula) an d 25% of missin g digits or p halang es. W ith the exception of one from Missisquoi with a uniformly short leg, Poultney River was the only site that had frogs submitted with limb malformations representing abnormal bone growth but with all components of the limb repre sented. T hese fro gs had rotation of th e limb w ith bone bridgin g as the on ly abnormality(as shown in 14895-010); cutaneous fusion between digits 1 and 2 but the bones of these digits were normal; and (14895-017) had a large distorted region of femur with m id-shaft disru ption of the trabecu lae and c ortex w ith the distal limb unrem arkab le.

This site had the mo st apparent errors in initiation (amelia) as well as the most truncations involving the femur. Although no control frogs were submitted from this site for comparison, the avera ge bod y cond ition of m alform ed frog s from this site is poor to em aciated.  14895-010  15   3.

Amelia at Lapans Bay represented 16% of all of the `97 V erm ont frog s subm itted with no obvious limb development on one side; 32% of all long bone hemimelia (femur or tibiafibula) and 17% of missing digits or phalanges. (one of the frogs (14898-010) had a tibiale or fibulare missing as well as missing 4 digits so that frog was represented twice in the above malfo rma tion cou nt)  Fro gs with rear lim b ma lform ation (148 98- 004 , 013 no t included as these w ere fore limb m alform ations): Snout to vent length (n=12): 3.08 cm Weight (n=12): 2.46 gm Body condition (n=9): 1.89 No rma l control fro g: (n= 1) Snout to vent length: 2.6 cm Weight: 1.4 gm Body condition: not reported but the weight/snout to vent ratio suggests an emaciated frog. Frogs submitted from Lapans Bay had malformations that represented truncations of all bones of the limb. One frog had an apparent error in limb initiation. The single control frog from Lapans Bay and the 12 malformed frogs all had an average of poor to emaciated body condition. 14898-004 had a forelimb malformation.  16   4. Missisquoi NWR MISSISQU OI (14897) Total frogs with malformed rear limbs : 21 No Bilateral Am elia : 0 Hem imelia /ectrom elia : 7 =3 3% of all malformations submitted from Missisquoi Ab norm al feet or d igits : 13 = 62% of all malformations submitted from Missisquoi Abnormal limb but all bone components present: 1 (all bones are proportionally short) =5% Trauma : 2 Primary site feature: hem imelia /ectrom elia Rear leg ectrom elia (0 femu r, 6 tibiafibula, 1 tibiale fibulare, 2 foot, 11 dig its or phala nges). It is interesting that all of missing bone components in frogs subm itted from Miss isquoi w ere distal to the femu r. Missisquoi had 3 2% of all long bone hemim elia (most of these involved tibiafibula) and 54 % of missing digits or ph alange s. Average measurements for frogs with limb abnormalities for which measurements were taken: (n=12; accession 002 not included as not a rear limb abnorm ality, 003 was not included because it was classified as traum a): Snout to vent length: 3.27 cm Weight: 2.34 gm Body condition: 1.33 Average measurements for normal control frogs: (n=0) Abn orm al limbs w ere trun cated at a m ore distal site po tentially sugg esting a m alform ation that be gan later in development of the tadpoles at Missisquoi. Even though the frogs from Missisquoi had less severe malformations than some of the other sites, they were still in poor body condition. 14897-002 had a forelimb malformation. C. DETERMINATION OF BODY CONDITION Gen eral bod y cond ition assessm ent (goo d, fair, poo r, em aciated) p erform ed at nec ropsy seem ed to m ost accu rately reflect the nutritional status of malformed frogs. This subjective assessment at necropsy was independent of the affect that the ab norm ality or frog size mig ht have had on weigh t. Wh en m ajor bo dy par ts of the frog were all present, body weight to body length ratios reflect nutrition status of frogs more accurately than body weight alone or snout to v ent length alone as a lar ge frog (length) m ay be em aciated an d have the sam e weig ht as a sm aller frog with good bod y fat stores. For this study, it was assum ed that sex was not a factor in the body cond ition or size of these immature, recently metamorphosed frogs. Frogs necropsied very close to the time of tail bud resorption (metamorphosis just completed) may still have fat reserves stored during the tadpole stage. These frogs would not have experienced the survival pressures placed on a frog that had been required to actively capture food for a longer period of time and the fat stores in these recently metamorphosed frogs could be misleading if used as an indicator of succes s as a frog.  17   D. HISTOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix F). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristics of bone at the termination of the malformed limb was very disorganized and hyperplastic cartilage that was not ossifying normally and interfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change at the point of termination was the formation of small nests of endosteal type cartilage matrix with some organization but no obvious maturation or ossification. None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development. Traumatic amputations did have micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. N o cons istent mic rosco pic chan ges w ere seen in internal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, bladder, gonad, spleen, thyroid gland, thymus, lymphoid aggregates) that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. E. RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Radiographs were extremely helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of termination in both long bones and digits.(Appendix D) Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from m alformation, although necropsy observations and histopathology were also im portan t in ruling ou t traum a. F. RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING Lab tests were performed on the frogs sent into our lab so that information involving infectious agents could be looked at in relation to malformation types. 1. Parasitology In an attempt and made an compared to hem imelia o r to look for significance of metacercariae in the frogs, parasitology examined the frogs, cleared them estimate of metacercarial load. Metacercarial load in frogs from Vermont were relatively heavy, Minnesota frogs; the primary malformations in all Vermont sites were reduction defects such as trunca tion of a lim b wh ich has no t been disc ussed a s a direct seq uelae of m etacerc arial infection .  Parasitologic examination was performed on 14 frogs; with at least 1 normal frog from each site following procedure s outlined in the Study Plan (App endix C). Skin, subcu taneous tissue, coelom, oral cavity, esophagu s, intestinal serosa, kidney, urinary bladder, fat body, heart/pericardium, and skeletal muscle from the rear leg, back, abdomen, tail bud area were examined for metacercaria. Metacercariae were most consistently seen in the kidney, how ever this m etacerc aria w as mo rpho logically d istinct (mo st likely Ec hinosto mata e) from the me tacerca ria seen in other locations. Skin, tail bud, liver, tissue adjacent to eyes, epaxial muscles were also common sites where meta cercar iae (mo st likely D iplostom atidae) w ere fou nd. Th e me tacerca riae table in Appendix H is organized by malformation and, although statistical analysis was not meaningful due to the small numbers, an association between metacercariae and malformation was not obvious. Metacercariae were present in both normal and malform ed frogs. Appendix H also contains a table for the adult helminths that were found in these frogs but these are listed for interest and are thought to be incidental findings as there was no pathology associated with these parasites.  18   The hip regio n of a clear ed frog pictured above show s three m etacerc ariae. 2. Bacteriology: Cultures of liver and kidney from 30 abnormal frogs and 15 normal frogs (45 frogs) were conducted following the protocol outlined in the study plan (Appen dix C). 29 different bacteria were isolated and identified from these frog s; most of them were in the group Enterobacteriaceae and are not usually considered to be primary pathogens. One important excep tion to this was Aero mon as hyd rophila which was most comm only isolated from frogs collected at Lap ans B ay. Aero mon as hyd rophila is a know n patho gen of am phibian s and re ptiles. No ne of the fro gs with Aero mon as hyd rophila isolated had evidence of trauma. The most common isolates from all sites were Alcaligenes xylosidans and Pseu dom onas c epacia and these bacteria were also isolated from norm al control frogs. No isolates could b e related to malfo rma tions.  3. Virology Attempts to isolate virus from livers, kidneys, hearts and occasionally skin sampled from 32 abnormal frogs and 19 normal frogs (51 frogs) followed the protocol for virus isolation outlined in the study plan. No viruses were isolated or identified in negatively stained preparations for electron microscopic in any of the samples from any of the frogs in this study.

Many of these terms, defined in Appendix B, were originally used to describe defects that are present in the mamm alian fetus at birth. Direct application of these terms to frogs that metamorphose in a free-living postembryonic state may or may not prove to be appropriate. However, common terminology may allow recognition of similar conditions by individuals in related specialties involving developmental anomalies across species and bring new interest and collaboration to the issues involving malformed frogs. The terminology in reference to possible points of error in development (mesodermal versus ectodermal) may be simplistic, but allows an initial attempt at looking at the pathogene sis of some of these malform ations. Case num ber : National Wildlife Health Center (NW HC) reference number given to a group of frogs submitted from the same site and usually collected in a similar time frame. Accession number : NW HC reference number given to individual frogs within a case. Body condition (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Bod y cond ition reflects the nutritiona l state of the frog and is determined by the pathologist by subjective assessment of relative quantity of muscle and body fat present in the frog at the time of necropsy. Assessment of body condition is independent of absolute weight or snout to vent length. Body condition has been scored in the following w ay so that averages can be m ade for com parison betwee n sites and abnorm alities; good = 4, fair= 3, poor = 2, em aciated= 1. Good body condition: Ad equate skeletal muscle and abu ndant fat in the fat bodies. Fair body co ndition: Adequate skeletal mu scle with reduced fat in the fat bodies. Poor bod y condition: Adequ ate skeletal muscle with scant or no body fat in the fat bodies. Em aciated body condition: Ske letal muscle wasting and no b ody fat in the fat bodies. W eight to length ratio (as defined for this report by Meteyer): The weight (gm) of the frog divided by the length (cm) of the snout to vent length of the frog which provides an approxim ation of nutritional status or body con dition as a numerical index value which correlates with body condition as assessed at necropsy. M orph ogen esis : Developmental process which gives rise to highly organized and specialized tissues through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Path ogen esis : Cellular events, reactions and other pathologic m echanisms oc curring in the developm ent of disease M esoderm : The embryonic layer from which connective tissue, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood, vasculature, notochord, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, kidney, and gonads are derived. Ectoderm : The embryonic layer from which epidermal tissues (skin, hair, etc.), mucous membranes, nervous tissue, and extern al sense or gans (ey e, ear, etc.) ar e derive d. Malformations: Primary errors in any phase of morphogenesis including cell proliferation, cell migration, differen tiation, pro gram med cell death or regres sion of larv al structur es. Deformations: Deformations arise later in fetal life and represent alterations in form or structure resulting from mec hanica l factors. The re is no intrin sic defect in m orph ogen esis. M alformation sequence : cascade of events leading to malformation (IE urethral obstruction may cause secondary affect of rena l mor phog enesis an d ma y lead to de fects in the low er limb s due to co mp ression of blood vessels).  20   Appendix A: Definitions Continued . Malformation syndrome : single etiologic agent that simultaneously affects several tissues (IE viruses) RCK. Tera togen esis : Abnormal development that gives rise to malformations Teratogen : An agent or factor that causes the production of physical defects in the developing organism (embryo) Hy pop lasia : Incomplete development of an organ Aplasia (agen esis): Lack of development of an organ or tissue often resulting from failure of appearance of the primordium of an organ in embryonic development. For example, amelia is aplasia or agenesis of a limb. Ectro me lia : Hypoplasia or aplasia of one or more long bones of limbs. Types of ectromelia are amelia, hemimelia, and phocomelia. Ectro dacty ly : Absence of a digit (toe or finger) Brachydactyly: Absence o f phalanx (a bone that com prise the digits) Am elia : No obvious limb development Hem imelia : Developmental anomaly characterized by absence of all or part of the distal half of a limb; fibular hemimelia, tibial hem imelia Pho com elia : Absence of the proximal portion of a limb, IE feet attached to the body by a single small irregularly shaped bone Polym elia : A developm ental anomaly cha racterized by the presence of sup ernum erary limbs. Sym pod ia : Fusion of lower extremities Skin W eb (as defined for this report by M eteyer): The skin covering the leg traverses at least one joint restricting motion. Dorsal/ventral pigmentation maintained. Malformation or deformation of bone is often associated with restricted limb d evelop men t and is seen as rotation of the invo lved bo ne or join t, foresho rtening of the bon e, or fusion of joint. Rotation (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Deviation of bone or joint causing distal limb to have abnormal orientatio n.  21   APPENDIX B: INVESTIGATION OF DEFORMITIES IN THE NORTHERN LEOPARD FROG (RANA PIPIENS) AT SELECTED SITES IN VERMONT  Background and Justification In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996. The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont. Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces. T he m ost exten sive w ork to da te has bee n cond ucted in M inneso ta and in the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring have not been identified, however, the predominant theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take the first steps in examining the abnormalities in the Vermont frogs. Specifically, this investigation will examine affected frogs from four sites in Vermont, catalogue the external and internal abnormalities, and compare to frogs of an unaffected site in Vermont, as well as abnormal frogs collected from M inneso ta in 1995 and 19 96. Se lect sam ples w ill be exam ined for virolog y, bacter iology, an d para sitology. T he ove rall information should verify whether the frogs in Vermont have developmental abnormalities, whether the abnormalities observed in Vermont are the same as those observed in Minnesota, and to begin to determine whether viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites could be respo nsible for the abnorm alities. Purpo se The purposes of this investigation are several fold: (1) to determine whether the abnormalities observed in northern leopard frogs in Vermont are developmental in nature; (2) to compare abnormal frogs to normal-appearing frogs collected from an expe cted con trol site to verify that there ar e differen ces; (3) to com pare ab norm alities found in Ver mo nt to abnormalities found in Minnesota to determine if they are the same phenomenon; and (4) to determine if a subsample of frogs h arbor viruses, b acteria, or parasites w hich co uld be re spons ible for the ab norm alities obser ved in V erm ont. Methods For ty north ern leop ard fro g bree ding sites ha ve bee n identified u sing rec ent data fro m re ptile and am phibian atlas wo rk in Ver mo nt. Nor thern leo pard fr og m etam orph s will be co llected from these sites in July , 1997 a s part of a larg er study to determ ine the distrib ution of de form ed leop ard fro gs in Ve rmo nt. The 40 sites includ e M issisquoi N ational W ildlife Refu ge and the four sites w here V TA NR staff observ ed defo rmities in 1996 . Fifteen ab norm al-appe aring fro gs from up to four sites, an d five nor mal-a ppear ing from a site expec ted to be un affected w ill be shipped live to the N ational W ildlife Health Center (NWH C) in Madison, Wisconsin. Frogs will be examined to characterize abnormalities and catalog them using standardized nomenclature and morphologic diagrams. Routine microbiological samples will be run as necessary on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 19 96 M inneso ta frogs.

The majority of deformities have involved multiple, fused, or missing hind limbs, however, some recently reported developmental deformities have also included vestigial tails, missing, misplaced or sup ernum erary eyes and ossification abnorm alities (R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97). The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light. Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97). In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities. Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites. Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997). A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont. The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology . The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997). What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology. This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared. The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

Following that study, we obtained ultradetail radiographic equipment which provided very detailed and magnified images of bone changes in the frogs. Given this new capability, quick response money was requested and provided in 1998 for a retrosp ective rad iograp hic study of these fro gs to see if ther e wer e specific bo ne cha nges u nique fo r frogs c ollected in Vermont or at specific sites in Vermont. Radiographs of 33 frogs collected in 1997 from 4 Verm ont sites have been perfor med and inter pretation of these rad iograp hic chan ges is com plete.

This tab le combines description of necropsy and radiographic findings. At this time we are determining significance of the radiographic findings based on malformation type and geographic distribution of the frogs. A final report will be sent by December 31, 1998 to the USGS -BRD E astern Regional Office, USFW S Region 5, and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources after the radiographic findings are incorporated into the overall final report for the Vermont study. We are currently looking for funding to extend this study to include microscopic characterization of bone changes with comparison to gross and radiographic findings in an effort to more completely delineate factors that might be contributing to the prod uction o f malfo rma tions at the cellu lar level.  26   APPENDIX C : U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources Division NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER 6006 Schroeder Road Madison, Wisconsin 53711 Phone: 608-271-4640 STUDY PLAN Study Plan: Investigation of deformities in the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) at selected sites in Vermont. Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont. The presence of deformed leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTDEC) on October 9, 1996. The prevalence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces. The most extensive surveys and identification of deformities in frogs and environmental sampling to date has been conduced in Minnesota and the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring has not been identified; however, the popular theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take a first step by completing a clinical examination of deformed frogs collected from four sites in Vermont to complete the following objectives: Objectives: 1. 2. 3. 4. Characterize and catalog the external and internal deformities in leopard frogs in Vermont; Compare deformed frogs to normal-appearing frogs from an expected control site; Compare morphometric descriptions of abnormalities in Vermont leopard frogs to abnormalities confirmed in Minnesota frogs to determine whether any similarities exist; and Determine the presence or absence of viruses, bacteria, or parasites in deformed frogs. frogs breed are identified in the recent Vermont reptile and on 12 of these sites; VTDEC staff confirmed the frog deformities be collected from each of the 40 sites. Four sites with at least this study. Fifteen abnormal-appearing frogs will be collected frogs will be collected from a control site where no deformities  Methods and approach: Forty site where northern leopard amphibian atlas (Andrews, 1995). ). In 1996, deformed frogs were observed by the public on four of these sites in 1996. A least 100 frogs will 10% of the frogs appearing abnormal will be selected for from each of these four sites and five normal-appearing were present in a sample of at least 50 frogs.  Recently metamorphosed frogs will be collected and examined for the presence and type of deformities. Frogs with deformities will be placed in 11 x 32 cm plastic boxes with lids containing 1 air-hole/inch in a chilled cooler or shady location. Approximately 3 cm of water from the site will be placed in the boxes along with sphagnum moss. At the completion of frog collection, the plastic boxes will be placed in hard-sided coolers, surrounded on four sides with frozen blue ice containers. The boxes will be held in place by a washable metal frame. Eight frogs will be placed live in each container and shipped via overnight service to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Upon arrival, frogs will be examined to deter ermine how the frog responds to this abnormality, photographed, the deformities will be characterized and cataloged using nomenclature and morphologic diagrams developed at NWHC based on frogs submitted to NWHC, photographs by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA, Helgen), and a Quebec study (Ouellet, 1997). Routine histopathological and microbiological samples will be collected and processed on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 1996 Minnesota frogs. Tissue samples or whole frogs will be archived for later use if funding becomes available or a potential agent causing the deformities is identified. Characterization of abnormalities and Necropsy Examination 1. Describe clinical condition/function or movement of any deformed limbs, multiple limbs or other grossly apparent deformities.. 2. 3. Photograph abnormalities before the frog is anesthetized or euthanized if possible. Euthanize one frog at a time using inhalation of Halothane (see NWHC SOP).  4. Necropsy will be performed with the use of a dissecting scope and 2X head loop. Frogs are opened with an ventral midline incision. The heart is collected and a blood smear made. Tissues for virology will be placed in viral transport media, tissues for bacteriology in vials of broth and tissue for histopathology in formalin. Very small tissues will be places in embedding bags in formalin.  27   5. Necropsy set-up and lab distribution of frogs is as follows: Sites 1-4 Case #'s 14895 - 14898 Accessions 001-005, Pathology: 2 blood smears Multiple tissues in formalin and embedding bag Tissues for bacteriology, virology Accessions 006-007, Parasitology: Description of gross pathology Submit whole carcasses in whirl-paks, in saline Accessions 008-010, Virology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues in viral transport media Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 011-013, Bacteriology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues bact broth vial Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 014-015, Hold Frozen: Description of gross pathology Freeze back in whirl-paks Normals, Case # 14899 Accession 001: Pathology (necropsy as above) Accessions 002-003: Virology (necropsy as above) Accessions 004-005: Bacteriology (necropsy as above) Virology 1. Virus isolation will be attempted in amphibian and fish cell culture. Liver, spleen, kidney, gut and heart were pooled by like tissues (liver with livers, spleen with spleens) with a maximum of three frogs per pool. 2. Viral isolates will be identified and characterized.  3. Electron microscopy will be performed on the pooled tissues in an attempt to detect any viruses that cannot be isolated in cell culture. Bacteriology Frog tissues consisting primarily of liver, heart, kidney and others will be placed directly into appropriately labeled tubes of tryptic soy broth (TSB) at necropsy and submitted to diagnostic bacteriology. The following procedure will be followed: 1. The 10 ml tubes of TSB with tissue will be vortexes for 5-10 seconds and subcultured immediately onto blood agar (BAP), eosine-methylene blue agar (EMB), (or MacConkey agar), Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJ), sabouraud-dextrose agar (SAB), thioglycollate broth (THIO), and cooked-meat broth (CM). 2. Media (except LJ and SAB) will be examined at 18-24 hour intervals for up to 72 hours before being discarded as negative. Positive cultures will be subcultured and identified to at least genus level. TSB will be subcultured after 24 hours if growth appears. LJ and SAB will be held as appropriate until sufficient growth develops or there is no growth. 3. Identification of bacterial isolates will be consistent with current capabilities and will include the use of commercial identification systems; predominately the API system, bioMerieux Vitex, St. Louis, Missouri. Reference laboratories, primarily the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa will be used as needed. Parasitology To determine the presence and species of parasites or evidence of parasite infections, live or freshly euthanized frogs will be sent to the parasitology laboratory for examination under a dissection scope. The following procedures will be followed: 1. Frogs will be skinned and the muscles and fascia examined under the dissecting microscope. will be teased apart and examined for metacercaria. Hind limb muscles  2. Metacercaria in the subdermal layers will be dissected free and placed temporarily in  strength Locke's solution and refrigerated. In some cases, this will cause the metacercaria to encyst so that fixation and staining can proceed. Notes will be kept and vial labeled as to collection site for the metacercaria. 3. A ventral incision will be made from vent to lower mandible to expose internal organs.  28   4.  The heart will be removed and a blood smear made according to DPL SOP.  5. All organs will be examined grossly, any parasites removed, prepped for fixation and fixed in AFA or 70% depending on the class of parasite. Most organs are small enough to examine via a squash preparation. Fat bodies will be examined via squash preparation for mesocercariae. 6. The body cavity will be examined for immature helminths. If found they will be removed, relaxed and fixed.  7. Eviscerated carcasses will be placed in 10% buffered formalin and later cleared according to Hanken ans Wassersug (1981). Following clearing frogs will be examined and the presence or absence of metacercaria noted. Critical Data: 1. Specific characterization of external deformities, 2. Documentation of internal deformities, 3. Histopathological findings for Minnesota frogs for comparison with Vermont frogs. Statistical Treatment: The research sites will be selected from areas with at least 15% of the frogs affected in a sample of 100 frogs. No specific statistical methods will be applied the data from this study. Routine statistical methods may be applied to determine the frequencies of certain lesions and establish similarities between sites. Assessment Criteria: Frogs will be examined for external and internal morphological and histological lesions and these lesions characterized and cataloged. The lesions present in Vermont frogs in this study will compared to lesions in Minnesota frogs described by NWHC in 1996.

SUMMARY Ninety three frogs were submitted for evaluation. Frog malformations were classified into 6 major categories and 12 subcategories based on necropsy observations of 72 frogs (Appendix J) and the findings of radiographs performed on 69 of thes e 72 frog s (App endix D ). All of the pr imar y ma lform ations in fro gs from Verm ont w ere relativ ely uniform, involved missing or incomplete limbs, which is quite different from frog malformations found in other states wh ere ou r lab has co nduc ted studies . Unlike malfo rma tions in 3 oth er states (19 97 and 1998 Nation al W ildlife Health Center data), Vermont frogs collected in 1997 were unique in having no multiple limbs, no phocomelia or complete but extremely abnormal limbs, no pure rotational/skin web malformations, and only one frog with a possible craniofacial malformation. It was interesting that, on the average, all malformed frogs from all Vermont sites were in poor to emaciated body condition without discrimination by site or malformation type (Appendix F, Tab les #1 and #2). Ag ain, this wa s not our finding in o ther states. R adiogr aphs w ere extr eme ly helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of abnormal termination in both long bones and digits. Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from malfo rma tion, althou gh nec ropsy observ ations an d histopa thology were also imp ortant in ru ling out trau ma. Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix G). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristic types of microscopic change seen at the termination of the malfo rme d limb was v ery diso rganiz ed and hyper plastic cartilag e that wa s not ossifyin g norm ally and inte rfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change seen at the point of termination was the formation of sma ll nests of end osteal type cartilage m atrix w ith som e orga nization b ut no ob vious m aturation or ossification . None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development at the term inal end. T raum atic am putation s did hav e micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. There were no microscopic changes in internal organs that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. Virology cultures were conducted on 51 tissues on 2 different cell lines adapted for amphibians and electron microscopy was performed on selected homogenates of frog tissues to determine if viruses were present. No viruses were isolated or identified in any Vermont frogs. Bacterial cultures were performed on 44 tissues and 98 bacteria were isolated and identified. There did not appear to be any direct association between bacterial isolates and the observed malformations. Parasitologic examinations were conducted on 14 frogs. Although the parasitology sample size was small, no association could be found between the presen ce of m etacerc aria and the occu rrenc e of m alform ations.  5   II.  BACKGROUND  During the summer of 1995, a group of school children conducting a wetland nature study observed a high rate of abnormal leopard frogs in Henderson County, Minnesota. Since 1995, occurrence of deformed frogs have been reported in 42 states and 3 Canadian provinces (Gilbertson). The species reported have included northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), spring peeper (Hyla crucifer), American toad (Bufo americanus), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana ), wood frog (Rana sylvatica ), green frog (Rana clamitans), pickerel frog (Ran a palustris ), and mink frog (Ran a septen trionalis ). Studies, funded by the USGS Biological Resource Division's Eastern Region in coordination with the Vermont Age ncy of N atural R esour ces, and the U.S . Fish an d W ildlife Serv ice, we re initiated thr ough the Na tional W ildlife Health Center in the summer of 1997. The objectives of the study were to characterize frog abnormalities, document the distribu tion of m alform ed frog s, determ ine the freq uency of ma lform ations, collec t baseline m orph om etric measurement of frogs, and collect water and sediment samples for analysis. The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) was requested to assist in defining the developmental problems in Vermont frogs. The role of the NWHC was to perform diagnostic assessments of abnormal and normal frogs from Vermont sites that were known to have malformed frogs. The diagnostic evaluation included gross necropsy examination, histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology. In the spring of 1998 funding became available to perform radiology on a subset of the Ver mo nt frogs. A report of preliminary findings was presented at the NIH/NIEHS Workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health held December 4-5, 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The data we presented at the conference made it clear that teratogenesis was occurring in tadpoles of the northern leopard frog. Factors that have been shown in the lab to cause teratogenesis are numerous falling into the general categories of genetic or environmental. Some environmental factors that can influence development are; chemical, thermal, infectious, or trauma-related factors such as UV radiation which can cause cell damage. Tadpoles are free-living postembryonic organisms that achieve all of their intricate developmental milestones without the pro tection of a sh ell or uteru s. The en vironm ent in w hich thes e tadpo les deve lop is com plex an d dyn amic . Sorting out the significant physical and chemical (molecular) factors that are contributing to teratogenesis in the frogs from those facto rs that are c oincide ntally pre sent in the en vironm ent with out direc t effect is impo rtant. M alform ations can indicate a ge neral tim e fram e durin g wh ich factor s are influe ncing th e teratog enic pro cess. Knowledge of the possible developmental stages that have incorporated an error can provide guidance in choosing appropriate times for collecting field samples for chemical analysis and guide researches in developing bioassays that mimic the timing of factors present in the field. Careful characterization and categorization of malformations occurring in the frogs can provide clues to potential causes through comparison with similar malformations that have been produced in lab experiments. Some of these laboratory experiments involving development date back as far as 1929 (Vogt). However, associations based on morphologic evidence are circumstantial and without further field and lab analy ses, con clusions canno t be draw n rega rding th e cause s of ma lform ations. To determine the causes of malformations, agents will need to be identified in the field at appropriate developmental times, and in the appropriate geographic locations in relation to occurrence of malformations. The agents must be capab le of consiste ntly pro ducing com parab le lesions in ap prop riate spec ies of frogs . Lab ex perim ents w ill need to take into consideration the role played by such variables as timing of exposure, dose and duration of exposure, and interactions between other environmental or host factors in the potential for producing the wide range of malfo rma tions seen in the field. La borato ry resu lts will need to be repr oduc ible und er field con ditions.  6   III. DEFINING THE PROBLEM The pathology of many of malformed frogs is obvious, the cause is not. Syndromes like these ha ve not be en clear ly defined in frogs an d even the directio n to look fo r answ ers is unde r deba te. Thes e chan ges are not prod uced b y a sudd en and catastrop hic insult. Malformations represent the end point in a developmental process that incorporated an error long befo re the ex ternal m anifestation of patholo gy. W hat are the errors in development and what questions can we ask to clarify the possible causes of these errors?  A. M orph ogen esis Fro m the time an egg is fertilized , an intricate r elationsh ip exists betw een cells an d cell 14897-011 layers w hich giv es rise to ver y orga nized an d highly specialized tissues. Th is proce ss is called morphogenesis. Morphogenesis occurs through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Cells divide and proliferate following well defined maps as they move and fold, becoming more differentiated and specialized. As cell layers interrelate to each other they profoundly influence the growth and character of cells around them. The timing of this intercellular communication is critical and is thought to be carried out primarily by chemical signals that affect gen etic expr ession.  In limb bud formation, the mesoderm carries all of the information needed to induce a limb as it interacts with the overlying ectoderm. If the lateral mesodermal plate, represented in this figure, is su rgically tra nsplan ted onto the back of a tadpole, an entire limb will form in response to that committed mesoderm. During later morphogenesis of the limb the mesoderm is responsible for directing bone formation and the ectoderm is responsible for prov iding the ce llular env ironm ent that allow s the limb to continu e to grow . B. Malformation vs. Deformation If something goes wrong during morphogenesis and an error occurs in the sequence of cell division, cell migration, cell differentiation or programmed cell death, pathology is likely. This pathology is called a malformation or a deformation. Malformations represent primary errors in development; deformations arise later in development and usually result from mechanical factors. Timing of the error or insult influences both the occurrence and the type of malformation produced. And the appearance of the malformation can indicate timing. For example, if the malfo rma tion is an inco mp lete orga n, the factor or insult m ust have occur red du ring a su sceptible p eriod p rior to com plete form ation of that o rgan to halting dev elopm ent. C. Teratog enesis Teratogenesis is simply the name given to the abnormal development that results in malformations. These errors can involve any level of organ formation; cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Teratogenesis can be caused by either genetic or environmental factors (intra-uterine factors in mammals). Examples of environmental factors include radiation, hyperthermia, low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, poor nutrition and chemicals. Factors or compounds causing malfo rma tions are c alled terato gens.  7   The same teratogen presented at different developmental ages can initiate different malformations. However, different teratogens presented at the same developmental age can res ult in similar errors in develo pm ent caus ing the sam e ma lform ation.  IV. FINDINGS A. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FROGS WITH SIMILAR MALFORMATIONS Du ring July and S eptem ber 19 97, 93 r ecently m etam orph osed leo pard fr ogs w ere sub mitted to the Na tional W ildlife Health Center (NW HC) for diagnostic evaluation. Frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune (12 abnormal and 6 norm al), Lap ans B ay (14 ab norm al and 6 n orm al), M issisquoi N W R (15 abnor mal an d 6 nor mal), M ud C reek (6 normals), Poultney River (21 abnormal and 7 normal) and shipped, alive, to the NWHC . Diagnostic methods and proce dures are detailed in the study plan (A ppen dix B). Necropsy evaluations did not reveal developmental abnormalities in the internal organs of the frogs, although there were renal flukes (most likely Echinostomatae) in various stages of development and inflammation of the cloaca was occasionally seen. The most common primary abnormalities in these frogs involved the rear legs and examples of these limbs with radiographic detail of the bone changes provide information that assists in classification of the patholo gy as m alform ations or deform ations.  1. Deformations a. Trauma Ver y few frogs sub mitted w ere con vincing deform ities or traum a. Aga in, defor mities ar e not prim ary err ors in development but structural abnormalities that can be caused by mechanical forces, trauma, infectious agents or inflammation. Gross observations of northern leopard frog 14895-003 from Poultney River indicated a short femur on one side suggesting a malformation. Radiographs, however, show us that the femur actually has a overriding fracture which is a deformity caused by trauma. Although frog 14897-003 from Missisquoi is missing a limb, the changes in this limb are consistent with trauma and not a primary error in development. Characteristic changes associated with trauma include an abrupt end to the leg associated with an irregular depre ssed cen ter and r ed, inflam ed, raised mar gins. M icrosco pic examination of leg of the frog shown at right (14897-003) showed hem orrha ge, inflam matio n and ac ute necr osis of the sk eletal mu scle surro undin g the end of the fem ur. N o radio graph s wer e availab le from this frog as the limb w as section ed for m icrosco pic evalu ation. 14897-003 Two of the frogs (14896-008, 14897-003) were in fair body condition suggesting recent trauma. Frogs 14897-013 and 14895-003 were in poor body condition suggesting a more chronic condition.

Malformations The limb abnormalities seen in the Vermont study that represent primary errors in development follow and include; com plete or p artially m issing lim bs, rotation of long bo nes, and skin we bbing . a. Am elia This fro g is missin g a limb . This is a ver y early p rima ry erro r in deve lopm ent. If we look at the radiograph of one of these frogs with amelia (below 14895-015) we see that not only is the right leg missing, but the right acetabulum (joint for the femur) of the hip also never developed and the two bones (ischium and pubis) are absent. The hip and hip joint on the opposite side with a normal limb are unremarkable. There is no evidence of inflammation, fractures or vestigial bones in the regions where the right leg should be. The limb never developed. 14895-002 Where are the errors in development? The lateral mesodermal plate is responsible for the pelvic development as well as initiating the development of the rear limb. The lateral mesodermal plate must have been present, as evidenced by the presence of at least a portion of the pelvis on the affected side. However, there must have been a very early error because 2 of the 3 pelvic bones nev er developed. A pparent lack of initiation of a limb also suggests an early primary error in the formation of the limb with either an error in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge or in communication between the mesoderm and ectode rm.  Radiographs of three frogs with completely missing limbs showed two types of changes. Two of the frogs radiographed were 14895-015 missing the ischium and the pubis of the pelvis only on the side witho ut the limb , as in the rad iograp h show n abov e. The other ra diogra phed frog w ith ame lia had all of the p elvic elem ents pre sent. Frogs with amelia were emaciated.

Hem imelia Tru ncation of the limb sugge sts an erro r prior to the com pletion of lim b deve lopm ent but an error th at prob ably occur red later in develo pm ent than tho se erro rs occu rring in fr ogs w ith ame lia. Frog 14896-003 from Alburg Dune does not have the characteristic changes expected in a traumatized limb. There is no swelling, redness, inflammation, or irregularity at the termination of these limbs. There is no scarring and the pigm entation o ver the e nd of the lim b is norm al. Radiographs of these limbs show no fractures in the segment of femu r that rem ains and the term ination is blun t. Frogs with hemimelia have truncated limbs but the proximal segment of limb that is present is relatively normal. This is one of 2 types of bone changes seen radiographically in association with truncation of 14896-003 bone s (hem imelia). If we look at these two radiographs, we see 14896-014 had an abrup t termin ation of the fe mu r witho ut bone reaction similar to that seen in 14896-003. In the radiograph of 14895-013, however, the distal femur has very abnormal bone development at the end of the bon e with irr egular widen ing of the b one silho uette and increased lacy bone trabeculae traversing the marrow. There is no attem pt at bone develo pm ent bey ond this ab norm al bone . The bone changes in 14895-013 suggest that there was an error at the pro gress zo ne; w ith mes oderm al signals; or with comm unication between the ectoderm and mesoderm which eventually stopped growth but may not have stopped as abruptly as 14896-013 14896-014 in 14896-003. The bone development apparently lost its control and became very irregular abnormal fashion in 14895-013 but it did continue to produce bone. In 14896-003 and 014, we see no irregular bone growth at the termination, the bone just ends su ggesting a mo re abru pt halt to dev elopm ent. Microscopically, the proliferative bone changes as seen in 14895-013 confirmed thick, partially ossified trabeculae traversing the marrow w ith irregular and thickened cortices whic h we re som etimes bent at the po int of abno rma l develop men t.

Abnor ma l feet or m issing digits (Ectrodactyly or Brachydactyly) Frog 14895-008 from Poultney River has a short limb and, although difficult to recognize, this disorg anized limb en ds with a structur e resem bling a foo t. The radiog raph o f this frog sho ws tha t not only is the grow th abno rma l but differen tiation of the bo nes is abn orm al as we ll. There appears to be abnormal development of the distal tibiafibula and there was 180/ rotation of the tibiafibula that resulted in the tibiale bone in a lateral position and the fibulare bone in medial location. The tibiale and fibulare are short. The digit positions are also reversed 180/ (they are aligned in the appropriate order relative to the tibiale and fibulare bones) and phalanges. These malformations suggests an error in the mesoderm that may ed later in the develo pm ental sequ ence re sulting in ab norm al skeletal elem ents limb only.  14895-008 are missing have o ccurr in the distal  14895-008  Another example of abnormal development of the feet can be seen in the radiograph of frog 1489 5-18.

Rotation of long bones and skin webbing The radiograph of the Vermont frog shown (14895-010), although missing the distal limb on one side has rotation of the lower limb of the more normal leg with a bend in the bone that is traversed by a ""bone bridge"". Rotational abnormalities in the Minnesota frogs were very common. These rotational abnormalities involved the limb proximal to the hock causing the flexed hock to have either a dorsal or ventral orientation rather than pointing in the more normal medial direction. Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations . Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs). L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition. The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis. Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent. Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length. The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated. B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly). Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb. Of the 61 malformations, (4 were bilateral) 10% had no limb on one side, 40% involved abrupt termination of either the femur, tibiafibula or tibiale and fibu lare and 43% had loss o r trunca tion of the dig its.  13   Fro gs from Miss isquoi ha d the m ost com plete limb develo pm ent with truncatio ns involv ing the low er limb distal to the femur. Frogs from Poultney River and Alburg Dune (although fewer number of total frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune) had the most severe truncations with the primary abnormalities involving apparent lack of any initiation of lim b (am elia) or trun cation of the limb at the fe mu r (fem oral hem imelia). A verag e body condition in frogs from all of the study sites was poor to emaciated. Frogs with no apparent malformations (controls) collected at the study sites also we re in poo r to fair bod y cond ition but the sa mp le size wa s too sm all to mak e an extr apolation to the overall population of leopard frogs at these sites. Lapans Bay had rear limb malformations primarily involving the tibiafibula a nd the foo t. This ch art of association of severity of malformation with site of collection might suggest errors occurring either at different developmental stages in frog development, or different dose or duration of exposure to a teratogen. 1.

Even though the frogs from Missisquoi had less severe malformations than some of the other sites, they were still in poor body condition. 14897-002 had a forelimb malformation. C. DETERMINATION OF BODY CONDITION Gen eral bod y cond ition assessm ent (goo d, fair, poo r, em aciated) p erform ed at nec ropsy seem ed to m ost accu rately reflect the nutritional status of malformed frogs. This subjective assessment at necropsy was independent of the affect that the ab norm ality or frog size mig ht have had on weigh t. Wh en m ajor bo dy par ts of the frog were all present, body weight to body length ratios reflect nutrition status of frogs more accurately than body weight alone or snout to v ent length alone as a lar ge frog (length) m ay be em aciated an d have the sam e weig ht as a sm aller frog with good bod y fat stores. For this study, it was assum ed that sex was not a factor in the body cond ition or size of these immature, recently metamorphosed frogs. Frogs necropsied very close to the time of tail bud resorption (metamorphosis just completed) may still have fat reserves stored during the tadpole stage. These frogs would not have experienced the survival pressures placed on a frog that had been required to actively capture food for a longer period of time and the fat stores in these recently metamorphosed frogs could be misleading if used as an indicator of succes s as a frog.  17   D. HISTOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix F). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristics of bone at the termination of the malformed limb was very disorganized and hyperplastic cartilage that was not ossifying normally and interfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change at the point of termination was the formation of small nests of endosteal type cartilage matrix with some organization but no obvious maturation or ossification. None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development. Traumatic amputations did have micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. N o cons istent mic rosco pic chan ges w ere seen in internal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, bladder, gonad, spleen, thyroid gland, thymus, lymphoid aggregates) that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. E. RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Radiographs were extremely helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of termination in both long bones and digits.(Appendix D) Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from m alformation, although necropsy observations and histopathology were also im portan t in ruling ou t traum a. F. RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING Lab tests were performed on the frogs sent into our lab so that information involving infectious agents could be looked at in relation to malformation types. 1. Parasitology In an attempt and made an compared to hem imelia o r to look for significance of metacercariae in the frogs, parasitology examined the frogs, cleared them estimate of metacercarial load. Metacercarial load in frogs from Vermont were relatively heavy, Minnesota frogs; the primary malformations in all Vermont sites were reduction defects such as trunca tion of a lim b wh ich has no t been disc ussed a s a direct seq uelae of m etacerc arial infection .  Parasitologic examination was performed on 14 frogs; with at least 1 normal frog from each site following procedure s outlined in the Study Plan (App endix C). Skin, subcu taneous tissue, coelom, oral cavity, esophagu s, intestinal serosa, kidney, urinary bladder, fat body, heart/pericardium, and skeletal muscle from the rear leg, back, abdomen, tail bud area were examined for metacercaria. Metacercariae were most consistently seen in the kidney, how ever this m etacerc aria w as mo rpho logically d istinct (mo st likely Ec hinosto mata e) from the me tacerca ria seen in other locations. Skin, tail bud, liver, tissue adjacent to eyes, epaxial muscles were also common sites where meta cercar iae (mo st likely D iplostom atidae) w ere fou nd. Th e me tacerca riae table in Appendix H is organized by malformation and, although statistical analysis was not meaningful due to the small numbers, an association between metacercariae and malformation was not obvious. Metacercariae were present in both normal and malform ed frogs. Appendix H also contains a table for the adult helminths that were found in these frogs but these are listed for interest and are thought to be incidental findings as there was no pathology associated with these parasites.  18   The hip regio n of a clear ed frog pictured above show s three m etacerc ariae. 2. Bacteriology: Cultures of liver and kidney from 30 abnormal frogs and 15 normal frogs (45 frogs) were conducted following the protocol outlined in the study plan (Appen dix C). 29 different bacteria were isolated and identified from these frog s; most of them were in the group Enterobacteriaceae and are not usually considered to be primary pathogens. One important excep tion to this was Aero mon as hyd rophila which was most comm only isolated from frogs collected at Lap ans B ay. Aero mon as hyd rophila is a know n patho gen of am phibian s and re ptiles. No ne of the fro gs with Aero mon as hyd rophila isolated had evidence of trauma. The most common isolates from all sites were Alcaligenes xylosidans and Pseu dom onas c epacia and these bacteria were also isolated from norm al control frogs. No isolates could b e related to malfo rma tions.  3. Virology Attempts to isolate virus from livers, kidneys, hearts and occasionally skin sampled from 32 abnormal frogs and 19 normal frogs (51 frogs) followed the protocol for virus isolation outlined in the study plan. No viruses were isolated or identified in negatively stained preparations for electron microscopic in any of the samples from any of the frogs in this study.

Many of these terms, defined in Appendix B, were originally used to describe defects that are present in the mamm alian fetus at birth. Direct application of these terms to frogs that metamorphose in a free-living postembryonic state may or may not prove to be appropriate. However, common terminology may allow recognition of similar conditions by individuals in related specialties involving developmental anomalies across species and bring new interest and collaboration to the issues involving malformed frogs. The terminology in reference to possible points of error in development (mesodermal versus ectodermal) may be simplistic, but allows an initial attempt at looking at the pathogene sis of some of these malform ations. Case num ber : National Wildlife Health Center (NW HC) reference number given to a group of frogs submitted from the same site and usually collected in a similar time frame. Accession number : NW HC reference number given to individual frogs within a case. Body condition (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Bod y cond ition reflects the nutritiona l state of the frog and is determined by the pathologist by subjective assessment of relative quantity of muscle and body fat present in the frog at the time of necropsy. Assessment of body condition is independent of absolute weight or snout to vent length. Body condition has been scored in the following w ay so that averages can be m ade for com parison betwee n sites and abnorm alities; good = 4, fair= 3, poor = 2, em aciated= 1. Good body condition: Ad equate skeletal muscle and abu ndant fat in the fat bodies. Fair body co ndition: Adequate skeletal mu scle with reduced fat in the fat bodies. Poor bod y condition: Adequ ate skeletal muscle with scant or no body fat in the fat bodies. Em aciated body condition: Ske letal muscle wasting and no b ody fat in the fat bodies. W eight to length ratio (as defined for this report by Meteyer): The weight (gm) of the frog divided by the length (cm) of the snout to vent length of the frog which provides an approxim ation of nutritional status or body con dition as a numerical index value which correlates with body condition as assessed at necropsy. M orph ogen esis : Developmental process which gives rise to highly organized and specialized tissues through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Path ogen esis : Cellular events, reactions and other pathologic m echanisms oc curring in the developm ent of disease M esoderm : The embryonic layer from which connective tissue, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood, vasculature, notochord, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, kidney, and gonads are derived. Ectoderm : The embryonic layer from which epidermal tissues (skin, hair, etc.), mucous membranes, nervous tissue, and extern al sense or gans (ey e, ear, etc.) ar e derive d. Malformations: Primary errors in any phase of morphogenesis including cell proliferation, cell migration, differen tiation, pro gram med cell death or regres sion of larv al structur es. Deformations: Deformations arise later in fetal life and represent alterations in form or structure resulting from mec hanica l factors. The re is no intrin sic defect in m orph ogen esis. M alformation sequence : cascade of events leading to malformation (IE urethral obstruction may cause secondary affect of rena l mor phog enesis an d ma y lead to de fects in the low er limb s due to co mp ression of blood vessels).  20   Appendix A: Definitions Continued . Malformation syndrome : single etiologic agent that simultaneously affects several tissues (IE viruses) RCK. Tera togen esis : Abnormal development that gives rise to malformations Teratogen : An agent or factor that causes the production of physical defects in the developing organism (embryo) Hy pop lasia : Incomplete development of an organ Aplasia (agen esis): Lack of development of an organ or tissue often resulting from failure of appearance of the primordium of an organ in embryonic development. For example, amelia is aplasia or agenesis of a limb. Ectro me lia : Hypoplasia or aplasia of one or more long bones of limbs. Types of ectromelia are amelia, hemimelia, and phocomelia. Ectro dacty ly : Absence of a digit (toe or finger) Brachydactyly: Absence o f phalanx (a bone that com prise the digits) Am elia : No obvious limb development Hem imelia : Developmental anomaly characterized by absence of all or part of the distal half of a limb; fibular hemimelia, tibial hem imelia Pho com elia : Absence of the proximal portion of a limb, IE feet attached to the body by a single small irregularly shaped bone Polym elia : A developm ental anomaly cha racterized by the presence of sup ernum erary limbs. Sym pod ia : Fusion of lower extremities Skin W eb (as defined for this report by M eteyer): The skin covering the leg traverses at least one joint restricting motion. Dorsal/ventral pigmentation maintained. Malformation or deformation of bone is often associated with restricted limb d evelop men t and is seen as rotation of the invo lved bo ne or join t, foresho rtening of the bon e, or fusion of joint. Rotation (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Deviation of bone or joint causing distal limb to have abnormal orientatio n.  21   APPENDIX B: INVESTIGATION OF DEFORMITIES IN THE NORTHERN LEOPARD FROG (RANA PIPIENS) AT SELECTED SITES IN VERMONT  Background and Justification In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996. The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont. Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces. T he m ost exten sive w ork to da te has bee n cond ucted in M inneso ta and in the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring have not been identified, however, the predominant theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take the first steps in examining the abnormalities in the Vermont frogs. Specifically, this investigation will examine affected frogs from four sites in Vermont, catalogue the external and internal abnormalities, and compare to frogs of an unaffected site in Vermont, as well as abnormal frogs collected from M inneso ta in 1995 and 19 96. Se lect sam ples w ill be exam ined for virolog y, bacter iology, an d para sitology. T he ove rall information should verify whether the frogs in Vermont have developmental abnormalities, whether the abnormalities observed in Vermont are the same as those observed in Minnesota, and to begin to determine whether viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites could be respo nsible for the abnorm alities. Purpo se The purposes of this investigation are several fold: (1) to determine whether the abnormalities observed in northern leopard frogs in Vermont are developmental in nature; (2) to compare abnormal frogs to normal-appearing frogs collected from an expe cted con trol site to verify that there ar e differen ces; (3) to com pare ab norm alities found in Ver mo nt to abnormalities found in Minnesota to determine if they are the same phenomenon; and (4) to determine if a subsample of frogs h arbor viruses, b acteria, or parasites w hich co uld be re spons ible for the ab norm alities obser ved in V erm ont.

The majority of deformities have involved multiple, fused, or missing hind limbs, however, some recently reported developmental deformities have also included vestigial tails, missing, misplaced or sup ernum erary eyes and ossification abnorm alities (R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97). The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light. Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97). In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities. Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites. Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997). A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont. The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology . The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997). What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology. This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared. The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont. The presence of deformed leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTDEC) on October 9, 1996. The prevalence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces. The most extensive surveys and identification of deformities in frogs and environmental sampling to date has been conduced in Minnesota and the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring has not been identified; however, the popular theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take a first step by completing a clinical examination of deformed frogs collected from four sites in Vermont to complete the following objectives: Objectives: 1. 2. 3. 4. Characterize and catalog the external and internal deformities in leopard frogs in Vermont; Compare deformed frogs to normal-appearing frogs from an expected control site; Compare morphometric descriptions of abnormalities in Vermont leopard frogs to abnormalities confirmed in Minnesota frogs to determine whether any similarities exist; and Determine the presence or absence of viruses, bacteria, or parasites in deformed frogs. frogs breed are identified in the recent Vermont reptile and on 12 of these sites; VTDEC staff confirmed the frog deformities be collected from each of the 40 sites.

Fifteen abnormal-appearing frogs will be collected frogs will be collected from a control site where no deformities  Methods and approach: Forty site where northern leopard amphibian atlas (Andrews, 1995). ). In 1996, deformed frogs were observed by the public on four of these sites in 1996. A least 100 frogs will 10% of the frogs appearing abnormal will be selected for from each of these four sites and five normal-appearing were present in a sample of at least 50 frogs.  Recently metamorphosed frogs will be collected and examined for the presence and type of deformities. Frogs with deformities will be placed in 11 x 32 cm plastic boxes with lids containing 1 air-hole/inch in a chilled cooler or shady location. Approximately 3 cm of water from the site will be placed in the boxes along with sphagnum moss. At the completion of frog collection, the plastic boxes will be placed in hard-sided coolers, surrounded on four sides with frozen blue ice containers. The boxes will be held in place by a washable metal frame. Eight frogs will be placed live in each container and shipped via overnight service to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Upon arrival, frogs will be examined to deter ermine how the frog responds to this abnormality, photographed, the deformities will be characterized and cataloged using nomenclature and morphologic diagrams developed at NWHC based on frogs submitted to NWHC, photographs by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA, Helgen), and a Quebec study (Ouellet, 1997). Routine histopathological and microbiological samples will be collected and processed on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 1996 Minnesota frogs. Tissue samples or whole frogs will be archived for later use if funding becomes available or a potential agent causing the deformities is identified. Characterization of abnormalities and Necropsy Examination 1. Describe clinical condition/function or movement of any deformed limbs, multiple limbs or other grossly apparent deformities.. 2. 3. Photograph abnormalities before the frog is anesthetized or euthanized if possible. Euthanize one frog at a time using inhalation of Halothane (see NWHC SOP).  4. Necropsy will be performed with the use of a dissecting scope and 2X head loop. Frogs are opened with an ventral midline incision. The heart is collected and a blood smear made. Tissues for virology will be placed in viral transport media, tissues for bacteriology in vials of broth and tissue for histopathology in formalin. Very small tissues will be places in embedding bags in formalin.  27   5. Necropsy set-up and lab distribution of frogs is as follows: Sites 1-4 Case #'s 14895 - 14898 Accessions 001-005, Pathology: 2 blood smears Multiple tissues in formalin and embedding bag Tissues for bacteriology, virology Accessions 006-007, Parasitology: Description of gross pathology Submit whole carcasses in whirl-paks, in saline Accessions 008-010, Virology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues in viral transport media Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 011-013, Bacteriology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues bact broth vial Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 014-015, Hold Frozen: Description of gross pathology Freeze back in whirl-paks Normals, Case # 14899 Accession 001: Pathology (necropsy as above) Accessions 002-003: Virology (necropsy as above) Accessions 004-005: Bacteriology (necropsy as above) Virology 1. Virus isolation will be attempted in amphibian and fish cell culture. Liver, spleen, kidney, gut and heart were pooled by like tissues (liver with livers, spleen with spleens) with a maximum of three frogs per pool. 2. Viral isolates will be identified and characterized.  3. Electron microscopy will be performed on the pooled tissues in an attempt to detect any viruses that cannot be isolated in cell culture. Bacteriology Frog tissues consisting primarily of liver, heart, kidney and others will be placed directly into appropriately labeled tubes of tryptic soy broth (TSB) at necropsy and submitted to diagnostic bacteriology. The following procedure will be followed: 1. The 10 ml tubes of TSB with tissue will be vortexes for 5-10 seconds and subcultured immediately onto blood agar (BAP), eosine-methylene blue agar (EMB), (or MacConkey agar), Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJ), sabouraud-dextrose agar (SAB), thioglycollate broth (THIO), and cooked-meat broth (CM). 2. Media (except LJ and SAB) will be examined at 18-24 hour intervals for up to 72 hours before being discarded as negative. Positive cultures will be subcultured and identified to at least genus level. TSB will be subcultured after 24 hours if growth appears. LJ and SAB will be held as appropriate until sufficient growth develops or there is no growth. 3. Identification of bacterial isolates will be consistent with current capabilities and will include the use of commercial identification systems; predominately the API system, bioMerieux Vitex, St. Louis, Missouri. Reference laboratories, primarily the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa will be used as needed. Parasitology To determine the presence and species of parasites or evidence of parasite infections, live or freshly euthanized frogs will be sent to the parasitology laboratory for examination under a dissection scope. The following procedures will be followed: 1. Frogs will be skinned and the muscles and fascia examined under the dissecting microscope. will be teased apart and examined for metacercaria. Hind limb muscles  2. Metacercaria in the subdermal layers will be dissected free and placed temporarily in  strength Locke's solution and refrigerated. In some cases, this will cause the metacercaria to encyst so that fixation and staining can proceed. Notes will be kept and vial labeled as to collection site for the metacercaria. 3. A ventral incision will be made from vent to lower mandible to expose internal organs.  28   4.  The heart will be removed and a blood smear made according to DPL SOP.  5. All organs will be examined grossly, any parasites removed, prepped for fixation and fixed in AFA or 70% depending on the class of parasite. Most organs are small enough to examine via a squash preparation. Fat bodies will be examined via squash preparation for mesocercariae. 6. The body cavity will be examined for immature helminths. If found they will be removed, relaxed and fixed.  7. Eviscerated carcasses will be placed in 10% buffered formalin and later cleared according to Hanken ans Wassersug (1981). Following clearing frogs will be examined and the presence or absence of metacercaria noted. Critical Data: 1. Specific characterization of external deformities, 2. Documentation of internal deformities, 3. Histopathological findings for Minnesota frogs for comparison with Vermont frogs. Statistical Treatment: The research sites will be selected from areas with at least 15% of the frogs affected in a sample of 100 frogs. No specific statistical methods will be applied the data from this study. Routine statistical methods may be applied to determine the frequencies of certain lesions and establish similarities between sites. Assessment Criteria: Frogs will be examined for external and internal morphological and histological lesions and these lesions characterized and cataloged. The lesions present in Vermont frogs in this study will compared to lesions in Minnesota frogs described by NWHC in 1996.

CURDIE, at Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas. The claimant was represented by Gary Davis, Attorney at Law, Little Rock, Arkansas. The respondent was represented by Frank B. Newell, Attorney at Law, Little Rock, Arkansas.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The hearing w as he ld on Au gust 20 , 2003, in Little Roc k, Arka nsas . It was stipulated as follows: 1. The employee-employer-carrier relationship existed at all relevant times. 2. The temporary total disability rate is $195.00 and the permanent partial disability rate is $154.00. 3. The claimant sustained a compensable left lower extremity (left knee) injury on June 10, 2001. The issues to be litigated at the hearing were as follows: 1. Is claim an t en titled to m ed ical b en efits and cos ts a ss oc iate d w ith his  1   left knee replacement? (Claimant alleges that the compensable injury of June 10, 2001, aggravated, accelerated or combined with his pre-existing left knee condition to produce the nec essity for the su rgery.) 2. Is the claimant entitled to temporary total disability from August 1, 2001, to a date to be determined? (Respondent alleges that the healing period ended on Aug ust 1, 200 1). 3. Is claimant entitled to an attorney's fee? The claimant, 33 years of age, testified that in 1985 he was involved in a non-work related motor cycle wreck at age 14. He testified about the wreck and the injuries he received: ""A. Yes, my femur was broke and several of my phalanges, which are your toes, we re com poun d fracture d, and I ha d a rope m ark on m y knee wh ere when it scraped across the ground, it rubbed a hole in the top of my knee, and they had wound up having to do an amputation of my toes, threequarters of my foot, and from some deal up in there around the tibia and fibula they put a screw in the back side of my knee. I don't exactly know wha t it was for. The knee cap itself wasn't broke or any ligaments wasn't damaged, and they had a p in in my fem ur. Q. Part of the extent of that surgery, you had the broken fem ur up above your knee? A. Uh-h uh (affirm ative). Q. Th ey had to su rgically break your tibia and your fibula in orde r to accomplish a leg lengthening, I believe? A. Tha t's correct. Q. And it was a pretty extensive process that you had to go through up through 1989, res ulting in pretty muc h the am putation of your foot, correc t? A. Tha t's correct.""  2   (T-9, 10) The claimant testified that he did not have any knee surgery as a result of that 198 5 acc ident. In Febru ary, 1992, the c laima nt injured his kn ee wh ile working at A uto Zone, Inc. As a result of that accident, he had a posterior cruciate ligament replacement. He testified that from October 13, 1992, to June 10, 2001, he did not req uire any tre atm en t for his k ne e. H e did tes tify tha t on one occ as ion h e ha d to quit one job h e had d ue to his kn ee hurting, b ecau se of the need f or lifting heavy objects. Additionally, the claimant testified that he had some jobs from October, 1992 until the com pens able Jun e 10, 20 01, injury that required him to do exten sive ben ding and lifting. He worked for the Humane Society as a kennel master and animal abuse officer. He was required to be on his feet, bend and stoop on a regular basis. He worked as a pest control employee. He was a termite inspector, a job which required him to crawl and bend under houses to inspect for pest damage. He worked in a liquor store, stocking the cooler and liquor shelves. He worked for Rock Church International as a business maintenance employee. He was required to paint, re-do and buff floors. The claimant then began w orking for the respondent/em ployer, a job which required extensive physical labor. His job, basically, was to clean hospital rooms. He performed that job without any trouble for one month before his injury on June 10, 2001. He had to clean many rooms a day. This job required him to make beds, dust, mop, sweep and clean comm odes. The claimant testified that the only real problems he had prior to the 2001 injury were arthritic problem s that we re aggra vated w hen the weath er wou ld chang e.  3   Th e c laim an t de sc ribe d h is J un e 1 0, 2 00 1, c om pe ns ab le in jury: ""Q. Now Gene, here we are now, June 10th of 2001. Tell us what happened on that date. A. I was coming from the break room in the basement, I was running real late so I was walking pretty fast, and when I came around the corner in the ba se m en t, the re's like a dec line g oing dow n to the elev ato rs. A nd I still don't know if it was water or oil or whatever it was, but there was something in the floor, and I slipped and fell right down on my knee. Q. And you experienced pain? A. Yes, s ir. Q. Can you be descriptive about what sort of symptoms? A. At first it was a real sharp stabbing pain and throbbing, so I hopped back to my supervisor's office, which was around the corner. I was going to put some ice on it and go home, but she told me to go around to the ER."" (T-15, 16) The claim ant's knee becam e swollen, painful and required extensive medical treatment. He had physical therapy and was prescribed medication, neither of which helped the claimant a great deal. He was told he was going to need a total knee replacem ent. The claimant had the total knee replacement on November 30, 2001. He underwent therapy, and was prescribed medication. He wanted to get a job, but testified tha t be ca us e of the m ove m en ts re qu ired to pe rfo rm any jo bs he w as cap ab le of , he d id not believe he could perform the jobs. The claimant did not believe that he could bend or stand, squat with his knees, nor could he run, skip, or jump. (T-23) Th e cla im an t be ga n st ud ying f or h is A ss oc iate in Ar ts (A A) d eg ree in accounting in March, 2002. In December, 2002, he obtained his AA degree. About that  4   tim e th e cla im an t be ga n re ce iving soc ial se cu rity disa bility. He tes tified tha t he wo uld like to get off of social security disability so that he can work. He has applied for some jobs based on his AA degree in accounting. The claimant complains of current left knee problems. At the hearing, he demonstrated how the left knee was clicking and somewhat off center. According to the claimant, his condition is not ""fixable"". He testified that he was told by Dr. Carl Nelson that he w ould have to ""live with it"". The medical records in this case reflect that the claimant came under the ca re o f Dr . Jo hn Va nd er S ch ilden , an orth op ae dic s urg eo n an d pr ofe ss or o f ort ho pa ed ic surgery at the U niversity of Arkan sas fo r Medica l Science s at Little Rock , Arkans as. Dr. Vander Schilden took extensive x-rays of claimant's left knee. He stated that the claimant had ""previous end stage degenerative arthritis"" and a ""strong possibility of patella fracture."" Dr. Vander Schilden's note of July 17, stated that the claimant's June 10, 200 1, com pens able injury cause d no ""increa sed m orbidity to the knee w hatso ever."" According to Dr. Vander Schilden, the claimant reached maximum m edical improvement on August 1, 2001. He referred the claimant to Dr. Carl Nelson, an orthopaedic surgeon and professor at UAMS. On August 20, 2001, Dr. Nelson stated that the claimant suffered from advanced degenerative arthritis of the knee, and would need total knee replacement sometime in the future. The claimant had a total knee replacement in November, 2001. On December 21, 2001, Dr. Vander Schilden sent a letter to the claimant's attorney stating: ""Mr. Dickerson's injury of 6/10/2001 did aggravate and accelerate the  5   nee d for th e kn ee re plac em ent s urge ry. I cannot provide him a permanent impairment rating secondary to the injury. H is un de rlying d eg en era tive a rthritis wa s so sev ere tha t the fall d id not cau se an y further dege neration tha t was no t already presen t prior to the injury."" (Cx-1, p. 19)(E m phas is added .) Dr. Carl Ne lson, wh o perform ed claim ant's total kne e replace m ent, sen t a letter to the attorney for respondent on August 5, 2003. The letter stated: ""I did not evaluate Mr. Dickerson to determine if his knee injury was associated with his subsequent surgery and I therefore have no opinion or no knowledge that I can impart to you in this area. ... ... I have no idea whether this surgery was necessitated by the advanced degenerative condition of his knee resulting from previous accidental injury."" (Rx-1, p. 1) Dr. Vander Schilden gave a deposition in this case on May 19, 2003. He stated that his opinions were within a reasonable degree of medical certainty. He is a professor of orthopaedic surgery at UAMS, and has been there for 18 years. Dr. Vander Schilden testified that when he saw the claimant on June 12, 2001, the claimant had ""en d st ag e de ge ne rative arth ritis."" H e te stifie d w ha t the def inition of e nd sta ge arth ritis was: ""There are three compartments in the knee, the inside of the knee, the outside of the knee, and around the kneecap, and all three compartment had ex trem ely severe degen erative arth ritis."" (Rx-3, p. 6)(Em phas is added .) X-rays taken by Dr. Vander Schilden showed ""strong possibility of a patellar fracture ."" ""Q. Okay. Ikay. W as it obvious the first time you saw him on June 12 that he wa s hea ding for a tota l knee rep lacem ent?  6   A. Yes. Q. Okay. And then I - - I think you saw him again on July 17? A. Tha t's correct. Q. An d at tha t tim e you obs erve d th at - - I'm rea ding from your re po rt, his presen t injury caused no increase d m orbidity to the knee w hatso ever. Is that still your opinion? A. Yes. Q . O ka y. A. It did not - - the arthritis was there. You're not going to make the arthritis any worse. Did it hasten his chances of having a knee replacement? Yes, because it's like throwing gasoline on a sm oulder ing fire."" (Rx-3, p. 7, 8)(Em phas is added .) Dr. Vander Schilden stated that as of July 17, the fracture line that he could se e in the x-ray in June h ad disap peared . Dr. Vander Schilden testified as follows: ""Q. And once a fracture like that heals, does it typically cause residual symptoms? A. The fracture itself did not. The trauma to the knee, as I mentioned, was like throwing gasoline on a smouldering fire. I mean the arthritis was there, but the traum a to the kn ee cau sed an exace rbation o f his symp tom s w hich un doub tedly led to his kn ee rep lacem ent sooner rather than later. Q. Did the injury - - whatever injury - - well, let me back up. You un de rsta nd m y clien t do es n't dis pu te th e fa ct th at h e fe ll and tha t he hit his knee and that he was hiving pain. A. He would have required a knee replacement anyway in the future. Q . O ka y. A. The fall made - - required him to have the knee replacement  7   soon er rathe r than later. Can I give you an exact time? No. Q. All right. W ell, I was going to ask you that question. Is your opinion tha t his Jun e - - th is ac cide nt h ap pe ne d on Jun e 10 - - tha t his Jun e 10 fall in which h e hit his knee acce lerated the k nee fo r knee rep lacem ent surg ery som ewh at spec ulative since o bviously we ca n neve r know wheth er or not - when he would have needed a knee replacement surgery had he not fallen? A. Ex ac tly. Q . O ka y. A. But I believe it did hasten the requirement for a knee replacement because of the intractable pain that he was having. Q. That was my next question. W hy did he - - why do you believe he had the knee placement when he did? A. Because of pain. Q. Because of pain? A. I mean you don't replace a knee, no matter how bad the x-rays look, unless the patient is extremely symptomatic. Q. W hat caused the pain? A. The trauma to the knee. So it's not the small fracture that he had on his p ate lla. It's the trau m a th at ind uc ed the frac ture tha t ca us ed his unde rlying deg enerative a rthritis to flare up."" (Rx-3, P. 10, 11, 12) ..... Q. Do cto r, the term acc eler ate is ap pro pria te a s a d es crip tion of h ow this trauma played into the necessity of ultimately having to have this knee replacement surgery which was done on November the 30th of 2001, true? A. That's true. Q. And you of course mentioned the term throwing gasoline on a smouldering fire. Another term that might be appropriate, the straw that broke the camel's back? A. Tha t is correct.""  8   (Rx-3, p. 16)(E m phas is added .) FI ND IN G S O F F ACT AND CO NC LU SI O NS O F L AW 1. The employee-employer-carrier relationship existed at all relevant times. 2. The temporary total disability rate is $195.00 and the permanent partial disability rate is $154.00. 3. The claimant sustained a compensable left lower extremity (left knee) injury on June 10, 2001. 4. The preponderance of the evidence reflects that the claimant is entitled to medical treatment and costs associated with his total knee replacement. The compensable injury of June 20, 2001 accelerated and combined with claimant's preexisting condition to produce the need for medical treatment. The treatment was rea so na bly n ec es sa ry an d re late d to the co m pe ns ab le in jury. 5. Th e pr ep on de ran ce of th e ev iden ce refle cts tha t the claim an t is entitled to tem porary total disability from Au gust 1, 20 01 to Ja nuary 21, 20 02. 6. Th e pr ep on de ran ce of th e ev iden ce refle cts tha t the claim an t is entitled to an attorney's fee for his attorney Mr. Gary Davis for controversion. DISCUSSION 1. MEDICAL TREATMENT A pre-existing disease or infirmity does not disqualify a claim if the em ployme nt aggra vated, ac celerated or com bined w ith the diseas e or infirm ity to produc e the disa bility for which com pens ation is sou ght. See: Nashville Livestock  9   Comm ission v. Cox , 302 Ark . 69, 787 S .W .2d 664 (1990); St. Vincent Medical Center v. Brown, 53 Ark. App. 30, 917 S.W .2d 550 (1996). As is comm only stated, the employer takes the em ployee as he finds him . In such c ases , the test is not w hether the injury causes the condition, but rather the test is whether the injury aggravates, accelerates, or combines with the condition. However, although a disabling symptom of a pre-existing condition may be compensable if it is brought on by an accident arising out of and in the co urs e of em ploym en t, the em ploye e's e ntitle m en t to c om pe ns atio n en ds wh en his cond ition is restored to the cond ition that existed be fore the injury, unless the injury contributes to the condition by accelerating or combining with the pre-existing condition. The present case turns on an issue of medical causation, and Dr. Vander Sch ilden is the only physician to ha ve rende red an e xpert m edical opinion in this case. As I interpret Dr. Vander Schilden's deposition testimony and reports, Dr. Vander Schilden has concluded that the claimant's work related injury accelerated his left knee condition at issue in this case, causing a need for knee replacement surgery to the left knee. The record is clear that Dr. Vander Schilden's medical opinion regarding ca us atio n ar e ba se d pr im arily on his e xam inat ions and x-rays , ob ject ive d iagn os tic tes ting and his o wn years of e xpe rien ce as a kne e su rge on and pro fes so r of o rtho pa ed ic surgery. Dr. Vander Schilden's medical opinion appears to be based largely on facts not only related to him by the claim ant, but du e to indepe nden t know ledge up on wh ich Dr. Va nd er S ch ilden has bas ed his m ed ical o pinio ns on c au sa tion . Dr. V an de r Sc hilde n is the only expert medical witness to testify in this case, and Dr. Vander Schilden opined that the claimant's work related left knee injury accelerated his left knee condition  10   ca us ing the ne ed fo r re pla ce m en t su rge ry. I cannot find any medical records introduced into evidence regarding the cla im an t's k ne e p rob lem s f rom Oc tob er, 19 92 un til th e d ate of his co m pe ns ab le in jury, June 10, 2001. The claimant apparently had numerous physically stressful jobs from October, 1992 through June 10, 2001. The claimant testified that he did not have the need to go to the doctor for his knee during that period of time, but did certainly have knee pain. However, after his admittedly compensable injury on June 10, 2001, the claimant has demonstrably objective medical findings of an injury which resulted in a recommendation from the chairman of hip and knee reconstruction at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at UAMS in Little Rock, Arkansas that he have a total knee replacement. No one recommended knee replacement for the claimant BEFORE the compensable injury. And, if he needed knee replacement, the preponderance of the evidence certainly reflects that the compensable injury ACCELERATED the need. As Dr. Vander Schilden stated, the claimant's injury was ""like throwing gasoline on a sm ou lder ing f ire."" T he pre po nd era nc e of the evid en ce the n re flec ts th at th e cla im an t's work relate d left knee injury aggravated a nd ac celerated claima nt's left knee cond ition to such extent as to require a left knee replacement. The claimant's medical treatment and costs associated with his left knee replacement is reasonably necessary medical treatm ent and related to his Ju ne 10, 2 001, co m pens able injury. See: W ackenhut Corp. v. Jones , 73 Ark. App. 158, 40 S.W .3d 333 (2001) (affirming Full Commission Opinion, Jone s v. W acke nhut C orp ., E9018 48, Ma y 15, 2000). 2. IS CLAIMANT ENTITLED TO TEMPORARY TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFITS FROM AUGUST 1, 2001, TO A DATE TO BE DETERMINED?  11   The claimant sustained a scheduled injury to his left lower extremity. An injured employee is entitled to temporary total disability compensation for a scheduled injury during the period of time that he is within his healing period and has not returned to work. The respondent alleges that claimant's healing period ended on August 1, 2001. (Rx-2, p. 28) Dr. Vander Schilden, in his report of July 17, 2001, indicated that the claimant's fracture had healed ,according to x-rays. Dr. Vander Schilden stated that the present injury caused no increased ""morbidity"" to the knee whatsoever. He opined that the claimant was going to need a total knee replacement ""in the very near future,"" (and ""the future"" was made more imm ediate because of the compensable injury.) He referred the claimant to Dr. Carl Nelson since Dr. Nelson performs total knee replacements and Dr. Vander Schilden does not. According to Dr. Nelson's report of August 20, 2001, the claimant was complaining of left knee pain when he saw him. Dr. Nelson's x-rays on August 20, 2001, showed ""marked joint narrowing, osteophyte formation in the lateral compartment, a cyst and joint narrowing."" (Rx-2, p. 30) Dr. Nelson scheduled the claimant for a total knee replacement in November, 2001. The hearing period is defined as the p eriod nec essa ry for the healing of a n injury resulting from an acc ident. A.C.A .  11-9-102(12) (Repl. 2002) The healing period continues until the injured employee is as far restored as the permanent character of the injury will permit. The healing period ends once the underlying condition has become stable and when nothing further in the way of m edical treatm ent will impro ve the pe rm anen t charac ter of the injury. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. Ap p. 124, 62 8 S.W .2d 582 (1982). Subsequent to the total knee replacement in November, 2001, the claimant told his treating medical personnel that Dr. Nelson had ""dismissed him."" (Rx-1, p. 76)  12   Add itionally, it appears tha t the claim ant re-injured his left knee on Jan uary 21, 200 2. Th e n ote at R es po nd en t's E xh ibit 1 , Pa ge 71 sta tes tha t th e c laim an t ""fe ll tod ay"" (Janua ry 21, 2002) on to his left knee . His left knee was ""w arm , painful."" ""Popping/cracking"" were noted. According to the medical records, Dr. Nelson had dismissed the claimant an d to ld him tha t he wo uld h ave to live with som e sw elling and pain . Ad ditio na lly, it would take speculation and conjecture to state that the claimant's healing period lasted past January 21, 2002. This new injury required the claimant to ""heal."" The new nonwo rk re late d fa ll occ urre d sh ortly af ter th e cla im an t's s urg ery. T he ref ore , the claim an t is entitled to temporary total disability from August 1, 2001, until January 21, 2002. Th e cla im an t ha s sh ow n by a pre po nd era nc e of the evid en ce tha t he is entitled to an attorney's fee for controversion of the above-described and discussed benefits. AWARD The claimant is awarded the benefits specifically described herein, along with the attorney's fee for claimant's attorney, Gary Davis, pursuant to the Arkansas W orkers' Co m pens ation law. Th is Awa rd shall bear intere st at the legal rate u ntil paid. IT IS SO ORDERED.  DON N. CURDIE, Administrative Law Judge DC  13"

The citation stated that ""[a] machine guard was not provided to prevent accidental contact with the v belt drive system, exposing the pinch points that are about 5 feet from ground level, located on the left side of the slate trimmer."" Id.; G. Ex. 5. The trimmer was about three to four feet high and three feet wide, and was located in the garage on a stack of pallets about four to five feet high. 23 FMSHRC at 313; Tr. 64-66, 70-71. A wheelbarrow was located on the ground below the t rimmer to catc h chips of slat e from t he machine. T r. 65 , 163 , 167 . Budd test ified that the oper ating st ation o n the t rimmer had a d rive wheel which t urned t he blade t o tr im the slate , and that below the drive wheel was an electrical motor that drove the pulley to operate the machine. 23 FMSHRC at 313; Tr. 67. He also testified that the v-belt drive was not guarded, exposing a miner standing on the platform to operate the trimmer to two pinch points. Tr. 67. According to Bud d, the upp er p inch p oint was loc at ed w her e t he v- belt dr ive c ont act ed t he u ppe r d rive pull ey, which was about three to four feet above the platform, and the lower pinch point was located where the v-belt came in contact with the drive pulley onto that system, which was about one foot above the platform.

(b) Guards shall not be required where the exposed moving parts are at least seven feet away from walking or working surfaces.  30 C.F.R.  56.14107. 440   Camara admitted that the v-belt was not guarded, but testified that the pulley had a guard on the front. Tr. 165, 169. He also testified that a person would not be standing on the platform while the t rimmer was r unning, and that the o nly way a perso n could g et ca ught in t he moving parts was if he was standing on the ground pointing a stick into the belt drive or was nine feet tall. Tr. 164, 166, 168- 69.

Tr. 165, 167. Camara also testified that the exposed moving parts were towards the back on the side of the trimmer, but did not pose a hazard because benches on both sides of the machine prevented access from the platform. Tr. 163-65, 167-68. He also testified that the moving parts did not pose a hazard to someone standing on the ground because it was about eight feet off the ground. Tr. 163-64. The judge found that the exposed moving parts on the trimmer were not properly guarded, posing a hazard to the machine operator standing on the pallet platform. 23 FMSHRC at 314. He dismissed Ca mara's t estimony as ir relevant because it addr essed w hether the exp osed moving parts posed a hazard to a person standing on the ground. Id. The judg e conc luded t hat t he viola tio n was not signific ant and s ubst ant ial, 2 and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 313-14, 319. On re view, Ver mont Slat e ass ert s tha t t he evid ence doe s not supp or t a find ing of a violation because Budd testified that the hazard existed to someone standing on top of the pallets next to the machinery, but Tango's notes and the citation indicate that the hazard exists to some one sta nding bene at h th e mac hiner y. PD R at 3. I t c ont ends tha t t he v- belt is ad equ at ely guarded and that ""a worker on top operating the machine would [not] be exposed to any danger."" Id. The Secretary argues that Budd testified that a miner standing on top of the pallets is subject to the hazard and that he had explained this to Camara during the inspection. S. Br. at 13-14. She asserts that the citation states that ""pinch points are about 5 feet from ground level,"" which corr obor ates Budd's test imony that the haz ard wa s to a miner sta nding or wor king on t he platform. Id. The judg e's cha rac te riz at ion o f Cama ra' s t est imon y as ""i rr elev ant "" be cau se it dea lt ""o nly"" with ""someone standing on the ground"" is incorrect. Some of Camara's testimony was an attempt to r efute t he dange r po sed by the pinch point s to a miner sta nding on t he pallets . Spe cifically, the judge did not consider Camara's testimony that the exposed moving parts did not pose a hazard because benches on the side of the trimmer prevented access from the platform.

We t hus h ave h eld t hat a jud ge mu st a nalyze and w eigh a ll probative record evidence, make appropriate findings, and explain the reasons for his or her decision. Mid-Continent Res., Inc. , 16 FMSHRC 1218, 1222 (June 1994). Camara's testimony regarding the hazard to miners on the platform is clearly relevant. Becaus e the jud ge did no t co nsider t his test imony, he err ed by failing to ana lyze and weigh all t he pro bative re cord evidence t o det ermine whet her t he moving par ts po sed a haz ard t o miners o n the plat for m. Our dissenting colleague appears to agree with our conclusion that the judge erred when he dismissed Camara's testimony based on irrelevance. Slip op. at 11. However, our colleague makes t he mistake of evaluat ing Camara's test imony here as ""mud died and inco nsistent "" and sug ges ts tha t r eman ding to the judg e is n ot nec ess ary. 3 Id. It is for the judge in the first instance, not the Commission on review, to evaluate testimony and make findings of fact. See Grizzle v. Pickands Mather & Co., 994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir. 1993) (ALJs have ""sole power to make credibility determination and resolve inconsistencies in the evidence"") (citation ommitted). 2. Tango 's Test imony  In conjunction to its challenge to the citations, Vermont Slate argues that the judge erred when he re fused t o allow it to c all Tango to t estify abou t his not es and t he citat ions writ ten o n the date of the inspection. PDR at 1. At the hearing, when Camara cross-examined Budd about Tango's notes, he stated, ""Mr. Baskin [the Secretary's counsel] said on the phone that Mr. T[ a]n go and M r. Bud d wa s [s ic] g oing to be he re, and M r. T[ a]n go is no t he re. No w I w ou ld think that maybe possibly he should be here."" Tr. 114. The judge responded, ""that's up to Mr. Baskin or you, no t -- if he's [ Tango ] not here, he's not here. "" Tr. 114. At ano ther point during the hearing, Camara sta ted, ""I wo uld like Mr. T[a]ngo t o be here during t hese questions. He 's obviously not here."" Tr . 132. The judge responded, ""Well it may be, but the Government chose not to call him."" Tr. 132. Camara then asked the judge, ""Can I call him?"" Tr. 132. The judge replied, ""To get him here, we're going to have to continue the case."" Tr. 132. He explained to 3  Our d issenting co lleague re lies on the Commission's de cision in Arch of Kentucky, 20 FMS HRC 132 1 (D ec. 199 8), to sup po rt her op inion t hat rema nding this mat te r t o t he jud ge is unnecess ary. In Arch, the Commission held har mless the judg e's err or in sus taining t he Secre tar y's object ion to the o perat or's quest ioning of her witness o n cros s-examinat ion, effectively excluding evidence the operator sought to submit. Id. at 1328-29. However, Arch is distinguisha ble because in that c ase, t he judge ha d the o ppor tunit y to co nsider t he value o f the excluded evidence in light of the Secretary's objection and the parties' arguments at the hearing. Unlike Arch, here, Vermont Slate did not know at the hearing that the judge would not consider Camara's testimony and thus did not have an opportunity to present alternative evidence or its arguments below. 442   Camara t hat he d oesn't ""tell the p art ies who t hey have to prese nt as w itnesses , the y decide,"" and that it was ""up to the solicitor [what witnesses to call], and they are not calling him [Tango]."" Tr. 132-33. Camara asked ""What do I do?"" Tr. 133. The judge explained that he could ""tell us your versions of all these citations."" Tr. 133. The judge then recessed for 15 minutes, and upon resuming, asked C amara ""[w ]hat would yo u like to do?"" T r. 13 3-34 . Camar a resp onded that he wanted to call Carl Onder and proceeded with the presentation of his case. Tr. 134. After Camara questioned Onder, he stated that he did not want to testify and attempted to rest his case. Tr. 147-48. The judge persuaded Camara to take the stand to testify about each citation. Tr. 148. On review, Vermont Slate contends that it did not subpoena Tango because counsel for the Secretary indicated that Tango would be present at the hearing. PDR at 1. The operator point s out that much of t he tes timony of Bu dd, t he inspect or w ho acc ompanied T ango o n the inspection, was inconsistent with Tango's notes, and that it was more appropriate for Tango to testify about his notes. Id. at 1- 2. Vermont Slate thus co ntends that it was prejudiced by Tango's absence. Id. The Secretary responds that the record does not support Vermont Slate's assertion that she indicated Tango would be at the hearing, and also denies that the operator made a showing of prejudice. S. Br. at 5-9. While the judge did pro vide a measur e of guid ance t o Camar a, a pr o se litiga nt, w e find he sent mixed signals to Camara in response to his request to call Tango as a witness. For example, when Camara asked the judge whether Tango should be present, the judge did not inform Camara tha t he co uld c all Ta ngo , o r o f the pro ced ure for do ing so . I n fact , wh en Ca mara spe cifica lly asked t he judge w hether he cou ld call Tango , the judge r espo nded t hat t he case w ould have to be cont inued, a nd did not direct ly respond to C amara's q uest ion. The judge's r espo nse may have confused Camara, because he again asked the judge what he could do, and ultimately did not pursue calling Tango in spite of his insistence that the inspector's testimony would be key to Vermont Slate's case. We do not suggest that the judge abused his discretion. However, as a matter of fairness and in the interest of justice, V ermont Slate sho uld be given an opportu nity to present Tango's testimony in support of its case, particularly in light of the fact that the company is proceeding pro se. Ba sed o n the r ecor d, t he compa ny clearly expres sed its int ention t o call Tang o to test ify and offered an explanation for its failure to su bpoena him. It also po ints to inconsistencies in Tango's inspection notes, the citations, and Budd's testimony as a basis for its allegation of prejudice. In light of these circumstances and the judge's dismissal of Camara's testimony, Tango's absence from the hearing may have prejudiced Vermont Slate. Accordingly, we vacate the judge's finding of a violation and remand to him with instruc tions t hat he r eope n the r ecor d and pe rmit Ver mont S late t o pr esent Tango 's tes timony relating to t he guar ding hazar d on t he tr immer. At t he same time, the judg e must r econc ile any  443    conflicting evidence and determine if the guarding was adequate to protect a miner standing or working on the platform next to the trimmer.4 B. Citation No. 7720768  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720768 to Vermont Slate for insufficient lighting in an area of the garage where the control panels were located, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.17001.5 Budd described the area as a ""dark closet,"" a two foot by seven foot open space next to the garage entrance. Tr. 34. The electrical control panel boxes and first aid supplies were located in this space. Tr. 34. Budd testified that in order to read the panel boxes, ""you had to get right u p in front of the m and really look ,"" which he a ssert ed was u nsafe if the po wer nee ded t o be shut do wn t o a piec e o f equ ipment in an e merg ency. Tr . 35 -36 . Bu dd a dmit te d t hat he co uld read the tag on the fire extinguisher which was the subject of Citation No. 7720767 and was kept in this area, but explained that the extinguisher was located immediately next to the door way where t here wa s more na tur al light from t he gara ge. T r. 38 -40. The Se cret ary cont ends t hat t he area's lighting was ""not sufficient to provide safe working conditions"" as required by the standard because in an emergenc y, a miner co uld mistake nly switch the wro ng elect rical box o ff due to the lack of light. S. Br. at 12. The judg e fo und tha t t he sp ace in que stio n had no a rt ificial ligh ting and t hat the only lighting in the area was natural light which came into the area through the garage door. 23 FMSHRC at 312. He found that the lighting was insufficient to illuminate the interior space where the switch panels were located. Id. The judg e conc luded t hat Ve rmont Slate vio lated t he regulation, affirmed the citation, and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 312, 319. On r eview , we first not e t hat the judg e cr edit ed B udd 's t est imony t hat the nat ura l light in the contro l panel area was not adequate to per mit a person to read t he labels on the panels.6 A  We agree with the Se cretar y that the rec ord do es not supp ort V ermont Slate's assertions that the judge refused to allow it to call Okey Reitter, MSHA's Assistant District Manager , to test ify. First, c ontr ary to the o perat or's sugge stion, ther e is no indicat ion in the reco rd t hat at any time befor e the he aring, V ermont Slate r equest ed tha t Reit ter be pres ent at the hearing, or t hat t he Secr etar y objecte d to its req uest , or that the judg e consid ered t he matt er and sus ta ined t he S ecr et ary' s ob ject ion. In fa ct , t he r eco rd in dica te s th at at the hear ing, Cama ra d id not attempt to call Reitter to testify. Moreover, Reitter's absence from the hearing did not prejud ice Vermo nt Slat e, beca use Reit ter was neit her pr esent at t he inspect ion nor a part y to t he post-inspection telephone conference between MSHA and the operator.

Farmer v. Island Creek Coal Co., 14 FMSHRC 1537, 1541 (Sep t. 1992).

Her e, w e find n ot hing in t he r eco rd t hat wo uld warrant us taking the extraordinary step of reversing the judge's credibility determinations with regar d to this cita tion. 7 Accor dingly, we affirm the judge's finding o f a violatio n. C. Citation No. 7720772  Vermont Slate received Citation No. 7720772 for failing to provide a safe means of access to the trimmer, allegedly in violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.11001.8 This is the same trimmer that was the subject of Citation No. 7720771, located on a stack of pallets about five-feet high. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . Budd test ified that Camara t old t he inspect ors t hat an o perat or ac cessed the trimmer by climbing the pallets. Id. Budd a lso te stified tha t a miner had to s tick his feet in the holes between the pallets and pull himself up. Tr. 79-80. There were no handrails, steps, or ladder p rovide d for miners access ing the t rimmer. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . Camar a's te stimony corroborated Budd's description of this arrangement. Id.; Tr. 170- 71. T he judge fo und tha t t he pallets, without steps or handrails, failed to provide a safe means of access to the trimmer. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . He co ncluded t hat Ve rmont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard, affirmed the c itatio n, and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 315, 319. Notwithstanding Vermont Slate's assertion that the pallets were a safe means of access to the t rimmer (PD R at 3 -4), the judg e's co nclusion t hat, in the absenc e of st eps o r handr ails, the pallets were an unsafe means of access is both reasonable and amply supported by the record. See Donovan ex rel. Chacon v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 709 F.2d 8 6, 92 (D.C . Cir. 1 983) (the Commis sion may no t ""s ubst itu te a co mpet ing vie w o f the fact s for the view [ an] ALJ r eas ona bly reached""). Accordingly, we affirm the judge's finding of a violation.  doorway. Vermont Slate a ssert s that the judg e's dec ision to vacat e anot her cita tion at issue at the hearing (No. 77 20769) based o n his decision to credit Camara o ver Budd undermines Budd's credibility with respect to Citation No. 7720768. PDR at 2. The Commission has rejected, however, the ""false in one, false in everything"" rule of testimonial evidence, noting that ""it is not unco mmon, and c ert ainly no t r ever sible e rr or , fo r t he t rier of fa ct to find a w itne ss t o be cre dible on some, but not other, matters.""

Section 56.11001 provides: ""Safe means of access shall be provided and maintained to all working places."" 30 C.F.R.  56.11001. 445 8 7   D.  Citation No. 7720773  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720773 to Vermont Slate for allegedly violating 30 C.F.R.  56.150049 because the slat e saw o perat or w as not wearing e ye prot ectio n. The s aw was ""a radial saw arm"" with a circular blade about 28 inches in diameter and a half hood over the blade. 23 F MSH RC a t 3 15; Tr . 87 -88 . T he sa w o per at or wo rke d at the co ntr ol st at ion w ith t he sa w in front of him and po sitioned the slat e betw een himself and the blade. 2 3 FMSHR C at 3 15.

Bud d t est ified tha t c hips of s lat e co uld f ly off t he blo ck p os ing a haz ard of e ye injury while a miner positioned the slate with a crowbar, which could slip, and while a miner operated the saw. Tr. 91-92. It is undisputed that the saw operator was not wearing eye protection. 23 FMSHRC at 315. Camara testified that the common practice at most quarries was not to wear eye protection. Tr. 158. However, he also admitted that most of the miners at the quarry put on eye protection whe neve r ins pec to rs v isit ed t he s ite . T r. 158 , 1 80. He t est ified tha t t her e wa s no risk of e ye injur y beca use the saw had a hoo d o ver the blade and s pra yed w at er, and d enied tha t c hips w ou ld fly off the block of slate. Tr. 178-79. The judg e cr edit ed B udd 's t est imon y and fou nd t hat the saw po sed a ha zar d o f eye in jur y, and concluded that Vermont Slate violated the standard by not requiring the saw operator to wear eye protection. 23 FMSHRC at 316. He also found that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the violat ion was significant and subst antial and mo dified the cit ation, deleting t he S&S designation. Id. The judge affirmed the citation as modified and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 316, 319. First, we find no reason to disturb the judge's crediting Budd's testimony that the saw posed a hazard that required eye protection. Farmer, 14 FMSHRC at 1541. As for whether Vermont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard, while the o perat or ar gues t hat it w as not aware of the req uir emen ts of s ect ion 5 6. 150 04, the rec or d r eve als t hat saw op era to rs a t t he mine did w ear eye protection. In fact, Camara admitted that saw operat ors would wear eye protection when MSHA inspec to rs visit ed t he sit e. T r. 1 58, 180 . Acc or dingly, we affir m the ju dge 's finding of a violatio n.  Section 56.15004 provides: ""All persons shall wear safety glasses, goggles, or face shields or other suitable protective devices when in or around an area of a mine or plant where a hazard exists which could cause injury to unprotected eyes."" 30 C.F.R.  56.15004. 446  9   E.  Citation No. 7720775  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720775 to Vermont Slate for failing to provide a safety lock on the hose to a jack hammer, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.13021.10 Budd testified that the hose connected to the jack hammer was making a hissing sound and concluded that it was bleed ing air . 23 FMS HRC at 317 ; Tr . 10 5. H e als o t est ified t hat he sa w sla te and o the r mat eria ls in the area that are used in conjunction with hammering. 23 FMSHRC at 317; Tr. 105. Budd test ified that althou gh the ha mmer was no t being us ed at the t ime of the inspe ction, because the hammer cou ld be used , the lack of a s afety device on the hose t o pr event it from co ming apart and causing a whipping action was a violation of the standard. 23 FMSHRC at 317; Tr. 104-05. In suppo rt o f the S&S designat ion on t he citat ion, Bu dd te stified tha t it w as likely that during u se the hos e wo uld d isco nnec t if no safe ty lo ck w as in p lace , an d t hat if it d isco nnec te d, t he ho se w ou ld whip around out of control and potentially inflict serious of even fatal injuries. 23 FMSHRC at 317. Camara admitted that the hose did not have a safety device, but testified that the hammer was no t in use o n the da y of the inspe ction. Tr. 182- 83. T he judge c redit ed Bud d's te stimony and found that Vermont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard. 23 FMSH RC at 317. He also fo und tha t t he violation was significant and substantial and assessed a penalty of $140. Id. at 317, 319. On review, there is no dispute that the connection between the hose and the jack hammer had no safety lock. We also find nothing in the recor d that wo uld lead us to o verturn t he judge's crediting of Budd's testimony regarding his observations that he heard air hissing out of the hose and saw materials used in connection with hammering activities lying in the same area as the jack hammer. Farmer, 14 FMSHRC at 1541. Finally, the judge's conclusion that the hammer had recently been used was a reasonable inference for him to draw from Budd's testimony. MidContinent Res., Inc., 6 FMS HRC 11 32, 1 138 ( May 1984 ) (empha sizing that inferences d rawn by the judg e are ""p ermissible pro vided the y are inherent ly reasona ble and the re is a log ical and rat iona l co nnec tio n bet wee n th e ev iden tia ry fa ct s an d t he u ltima te fact infer red ."" ). Acc or ding ly, we affirm the judge's finding of a violation. F. Citation No. 7720778  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720778 to Vermont Slate for failing to provide a miner trained in first aid at the site during the work shift, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.18010.11 The individual trained in first aid was sent to another site because there was not enough work at the Blissville Quarry. 23 FMSHRC at 318; Tr. 128-29. The judge found that the evidence  Section 56.13021 provides: ""Except where automatic shutoff valves are used, safety chains or other suitable devices shall be used at connections to machines of high pressure hose lines . . . and between high-pressure hose lines . . . where a connection failure would create a hazard."" 30 C.F.R.  56.13021. Section 56.18010 pro vides in pertinent part: ""An individual capable of providing first aid shall be available on all shifts."" 30 C.F.R.  56.18010. 447 11  10   regarding this citation was undisputed, that the miner trained in first aid was sent to another location, and that there was no one at the quarry trained in first aid. 23 FMSHRC at 318. He reject ed Ver mont S late's a rgument that the abs ence o f a first aid miner w as not a violatio n of the regulation because the medical center was only 1.3 miles from the quarry, and concluded that Vermont Slate violated section 56.18010. Id. The judge assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 319. The record evidence clearly supports the judge's finding that Vermont Slate failed to provide a miner trained in first aid at the Blissville Quarry on the date of the inspection. Accor dingly, we affirm the judge's finding o f a violatio n. III. Conclusion For t he fore going r easons , we vac ate a nd remand C itatio n No. 77207 71, a nd affirm the judge's d ecision wit h respe ct t o Cita tion No s. 772 0768, 77207 72, 7 72077 3, 77 20775 , and 7720778.  Theodore F. Verheggen, Chairman  Robert H. Beatty, Jr., Commissioner  448    Commissioner Jordan, concurring in part, and dissenting in part: I join the majority in affirming the judge's decision with respect to five of the citations at issue in this case. However, I would also affirm the judge's finding that the operator failed to adequately guard the trimmer, in violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.14107(a).1 Inspector Budd prese nted d etailed t estimony re garding the lack of guar ding of t he moving par ts o f the v-be lt drive of the trimmer. Tr. 64-69. As my colleagues note, slip op. at 2, the inspector clearly delineated the loc ation o f the t wo pinch p oints. He te stified tha t t he tr immer was ungu arded and tha t t he machin e o per at or wo uld s ta nd wit hin a fo ot of t he v- belt , an d ""ab ou t a rm's rea ch, maybe a litt le less"" from the pinch points. Tr. 64, 67, 69. He stated that because the v-belt areas were not guarded, an individual could possibly stick a hand in the v-belt drive or be drawn in from clothing, possibly resulting in the loss of fingers or a hand. Tr. 64. Consequently, I would hold that subs ta ntia l evide nce s upp or ts t he jud ge' s de te rminat ion, as a rea son able p ers on c ou ld ce rt ainly find this testimony adequate to support the judge's conclusion that the trimmer was not adequately guarded. My colleagues in the majority find that the judge erred by failing to properly analyze all of the probative evidence to determine whether the moving parts on the v-belt drive posed a hazard to miner s on t he platfo rm who w ere o perat ing the t rimmer. Slip o p. at 4. Sp ecifically, the majority faults the judge's conclusion that the evidence Camara presented on that issue was irrelevant because the t estimony ad dress ed only whet her t he expo sed moving p art s on t he equipment were hazardous to a person standing on the ground. Id. at 3-4. While the judge charac ter ized Camer a's evidenc e (which co nsisted s olely of his tes timony and a drawing of the trimmer) as irrelevant, I would call it muddied and inconsistent. It was not clear from his statements whether he actually ever confronted MSHA's concern about the dangers of t he v- belt to a t rimmer op era to r, beca use he sp ent a lot of t ime disc uss ing ho w impo ssible it wo uld be to rea ch t he pin ch po ints fro m the gro und . T r. 164 , 16 6, 1 68- 69. He ne ver clea rly explained how a machine operator would be protected from contact with the pinch point areas. Tr. 162-70. In fact, when asked about the v-belt, Camera testified: ""Was not guarded."" Tr. 169.2 This c ase is in a pr oce dur al po stu re s imilar to tha t o f Arch of Kentucky, 20 FMSHRC 1321 (Dec. 1998). There, the Commission found that the judge had improperly sustained an objection by the Secretary, thus excluding evidence the operator had tried to have admitted. Id. at 13 28. H oweve r, a u nanimous Co mmission held that althou gh the jud ge's evide ntiary ru ling was incor rect , his err or w as harmless, in part because the exc luded t estimony co uld not have  Sect ion 56. 14107 (a) r equires that moving machine par ts be g uarde d to pro tect perso ns fro m mov ing p art s t hat may ca use injur y. Camara did initially insist that the trimmer was guarded, but apparently only in the front. Tr. 163- 65.

I am hard pressed to think of another case where the Commission (or any appellate body) vacated a decision without even deciding whether the claimed error occurred. 4 It appears as if my colleagues are actually vacating and remanding this case because they believe the judge failed to provide the operator, who was appearing pro se, with adequate guidance about its right to call the witness.

HAVITZ Brian E. H avitz, M onro e, OH , Claim ant. Diana E. Settelmeyer, Chief, Claims and Correction of Records, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, CO, appearing for Department of Defense. HYATT , Board Judge. Claim ant, Brian E. H avitz, is a civilian employee of the National Guard Service of the De partm ents of the Army and the Air Force. His permanent duty station at the time of travel was the Air National Guard's 123 rd Air Control Squadron in Blue A sh, Ohio. In August 2000, he perfo rmed a tem porary duty (TDY) assignment at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. The issue presented to the B oard for re view conc erns M r. Hav itz's return trip to Ohio, which was routed from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Dayton, Ohio, through Chicago, Illinois. M r. Hav itz landed in Chicago as planned, but was unable to take the connecting flight to Dayton because it had be en overbooked. Instead of taking a later flight that day, or staying overnight in Chicago and flying to Dayton the next day, claimant rented a car an d dro ve fro m C hicag o to his h ous e in M onr oe, O hio . Upon his retu rn to O hio, M r. Hav itz requested reimbursement for the cost of the rental car. When the unused portion of claimant's ticket was turned in, the commercial transportation office (CTO) advised that it would not be possible to obtain a refund for the partial por tion of th e retu rn f ligh t. Ad ditiona lly, although M r. Hav itz was authorized to rent a car while in Utah, his travel orders did not authorize rental of a car to drive from Chicago to Ohio. The command would like to approve the ex penses; the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) regards the claim as doubtful, expressing the view that claimant drove from Chicago to Ohio for his personal convenience. DFAS takes the position that the claim mu st be den ied. Discussion   GSBCA 15523-TRAV  2  Under the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), Government employees who travel on official business are expected to use common carriers for transportation unless the authorizing agen cy determ ines tha t an altern ative m eans of trav el is more adva ntage ous to the Government. 41 CFR 301-10.5(a ) (2000). When the employee does not travel by the method of transportation sele cte d b y the agency, the employee must bear any additional expenses. Id ., 301-10.6. The Joint Travel Regula tions (JTR), which apply to civilian employees of the De partm ent of De fens e and supp leme nt t he FTR, contain a similar provision. JTR C2001-A.3.d. The reco rd p rov ided to u s do es n ot es tabli sh w heth er M r. H avitz v olun tarily relinquished his seat on the overbooked flight or whether he was denied boarding rights by the airline. Although the FT R p ermits e mp loyees to voluntarily vacate a seat on a scheduled airline flight to the ex tent it w ill not interf ere w ith of ficia l duties, th e em ployee is nonetheless responsible for any addition al costs incurred. FTR 301-10.117. When an employee is ""bum ped"" invo luntarily, the e mp loyee is gene rally entitled to reimbursement for additional subsistence costs that may be incurred, but is required to ensure that any financial remuneration provided by the airline is mad e payab le to the "" Tre asu rer o f the Un ited S tates ."" FTR 301 -10.1 16; Om ar J. N orris , B-224590 (Nov. 10, 1986). The rationa le und erlying this regulation is that since the Government has contracted with the airline for the reserved seat and may incur additional travel expenses on behalf of the employee denie d the re serve d sea t, it is entitled to the compensation as a form of ""liquidated damages."" See John B. Currier, 59 Comp. Gen . 95 (1979 ); Ch ester S ipkin , B-148879 (Aug. 28, 1970). The proper disposition of this claim depends, therefore, on whether the relinquishment of the reserved seat was vol unt ary or i nvo lun tary. To the ex tent M r. Havitz volunteered to give up his reserved seat on the scheduled flight, he is fu lly respon sible fo r the ex cess c osts of travel h e incurred b y renting a car to perform the final leg of his return trip. In ge neral, Go vern men t emp loyees w ho v olun teer to be bum ped from an ove rbooke d flight are better serv e d to await a later flight, if possible, rather than arrange alternative transportation. In any eve nt, if claim ant vo luntarily ag reed to give up his seat, while he canno t recou p the c ost of the ren tal car, he is perm itted to re tain any compensation that the airlin e aff orde d him for ag reeing to give up h is seat. JTR C2201B; Charles E. Armer , 59 Co mp. G en. 203 (1 980). If Mr. Havitz was involuntarily denied a seat on the plane, the airline was requ ired to book him on another flight to Dayton as soon as possible and, depending on the length of the delay attributable to the need to reschedule, may also have been requ ired to f urnish him w ith compensation. If th is w oul d ha ve r equ ired an o ver nig ht sta y, Mr . Havitz may have been entitled to subsistence expenses for lodging and meals and incidental expenses, to the extent the airline w ould not have absorbed these costs. At the same time, if the airline compensated Mr. Ha vitz f or the loss of his reserved seat, he would be required to turn over that compensation to the Government. If this is the situation, and Mr. Havitz chose to rent a car and return home rather th an stay ov ernigh t in the Chicago area, he may be compensated for the expense he incurr ed to th e exte nt it does not exceed the cost the Government would have incurred for lodging and per diem as a result of the d elayed travel. He sho uld, how ever, also remit a ny com pens ation re ceive d fro m the airline to the G over nm ent. This matter is returned to the agency for disposition in accordance with the above.   GSBCA 15523-TRAV  3  _________________________________ CATHERINE B. HYATT Board Judge"
GX251-10-13559211	5  Chap ter 1 The Approach  Background Each year, approximately one percent of the U.S. population, some two to three million individu als, experiences a nigh t of homelessn ess that puts them in contact with a hom eless assistance provider. The estimate is conservative  it does not include those affected by natural disasters, nor those who do not contact a homeless assistance provider, e.g., who m ay b e tak en in by a friend or spe nd the n igh t in a car. Th e circu m stan ces th at ca use hom eless nes s for tw o to th ree m illion Am erica ns a re va ried. However, research conducted since the late 1980's shows that interactions among the supply of affordable housing, poverty, and disability account for most of the precipitating factors. Among poor persons, the risk of a night of homelessness is far higher than for the general pop ulation. Som ewh ere between four to six percent of the poor experience hom elessn ess an nua lly. Mos t of these ex perien ces are sh ort-term and the ind ividu als exit homelessness with minimal assistance and generally are not seen again. But the subgroup that tends to be the most visible is a group of about 200,000 people who experience homelessness on a protracted or repeated basis. On any given night, this group will represent almost half of those who are homeless. This subgroup has been identified as the chronically or long term homeless. There is increasing consensus that we can take actions that w ill reduce and en d this level of chronic hom elessness.  Exploring Solutions Beginning in March, 2001, the Secretary's office initiated several activities to improve the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) response to the services needed by pers ons exp erien cing hom eless nes s.         Secretary Tommy Th omp son met with Secretary Mel Martinez of the Departmen t of Hou sing and Urba n D evelop m ent (H UD ) and Secreta ry Tho m pson com m itted his Depa rtmen t to a collaboration that cap italized on the exp ertise of HHS in service delivery and of HUD in housing. HHS staff initiated regular, informal discussions with HUD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff to understand the programs and opportunities that could be involved in a colla bora tion . HHS, HUD and VA staff explored goals and activities of mutual interest and recom m end ed to lea dersh ip tha t collabo ration w as bes t achie ved b y ado pting a specific and targe ted focus on the issue of long term an d repeated h om elessness. Discussions with the HHS Operating Divisions were held to determine what options they saw to m ake their program s more accessib le to hom eless persons. Budget formulations and other administrative scenarios within HHS were considered.   6    An am bitiou s partn ership with States wa s initiated that ac know ledg ed the role of State agen cies in settin g the p riorities for using HHS assistan ce. The S ecretary se nt all Governors an invitation to participate in the partnership. Beginning in November 2001, a series of Po licy Aca dem ies for State and Local Po licym akers w as beg un. Th irty-six States applied to participate in the first of these, knowing that only eight could be accomm odated.  Th roug hou t the se ex plo ratio ns, a lead ing con cern wa s for HH S-a ssiste d serv ices to be m ore acce ssib le to e ligib le ho m eless perso ns b ein g pl aced in H UD -su pp orted hou sing .

By sum m er's end, it w as clear th at the co m plexity of HHS ' structure an d prog ram variety obviated a simple linear plan, i.e., one that involved an easily introduced change that exp an ded opp ortu nitie s for acc ess b y ho m eless ind ivid ua ls. The final development of significance came in the release of the Adm inistration's budget for fiscal year 2003. President George W. Bush endorsed as goal of his administration ending chro nic h om eless nes s in a deca de.  The Secretary's Work Group on End ing Chronic Homelessness At th e sta rt of cale nd ar ye ar 20 02 , Sec retary Tho m pso n es tab lish ed th e Se creta ry's W ork Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness. He asked Deputy Secretary Claude Allen to lead the Work Group in a comprehensive review of the Department's relevant programs. The W ork Grou p w as to repo rt recom m end ation s for a Dep artm ent-w ide ap proach that w ould contribute to the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness and improve HHS' ab ility to assis t pers ons exp erien cing chro nic h om eless nes s.  Representation on th e Secretary's Work Group On Ending Ch ronic Homelessness:  The action simultaneously ad dressed two needs: First, it brought the relevant HHS agen cies into a collabo ration to formulate a Department-wide strategy that addressed the multiple needs of this subgroup. Seco nd, b y focusin g on chron ic homelessness, it established a compelling link to themes that had been articulated by the White House, HUD and VA on this same issue.

Representatives were chosen by agency administrators for their knowledge of ag enc y pro gra m s an d th eir ab ility to repre sen t the age ncy aut hori tativ ely (A pp end ix A ).   7 Mr. Alle n item ized ch arges to the W ork Grou p m em bers an d offered a plan of app roach to und ertake four tasks: 1. Define the po pulation th at experiences chron ic hom elessness and itemize their service needs. Analyze the response of relevant HHS m ainstream assistance programs to the itemized service needs. Specify outcomes and objectives that would improve the response of these mainstream program s to long term a nd repea ted hom elessness. Offer actions the agencies could take that would improve access to and coordination of services that wou ld contribute to reducin g and ending chronic hom elessness. An Interagency Subcom mittee was formed im m ediate ly (Ap pen dix B ) and charg ed w ith pursuing each of the four tasks. The Subcom mittee met formally over a dozen times and held numerous informal meetings to analyze d ata, formulate recom me ndation s, an d ed it wri tten wo rk. To accomplish its work, the Subcom mittee: Reviewed epidem iological and services research literature that documented what is known about those who experience long term and repeated homelessness and about treatments, services, and supports that are effective with these persons. This material is su m m arize d in Ch ap ter 2. 2. Developed, administered and tabulated a service inventory for eight relevant mainstream HHS programs. The inventory sought not only to understand the adm inistrative features of each program, but their specific response to the services need ed by person s expe riencin g chro nic ho m elessn ess. The findin gs are su m m arized in Chapter 3.

GX253-43-11732476	"The Institute for Energy Law of The Center for American and International Law 53rd Annual Institute on Oil And Gas Law Remarks by William L. Massey Co mmissioner U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ""The Current and Future Gas Industry"" Houston, Texas February 21, 2002  Good M orning. I am honored to address this distinguished gathering of lawyers, corporate officials, academics and policy makers. I am a lawyer by FERC nine years ago. I living practicing before than le gal an alysis. A d training, and eagerly anticipated bringing my legal prowess to the quickly learned that, although thousands of lawyers make a good FERC, we primarily are engaged in energy policy making rather egree in eco nom ics w ould actua lly be mo re help ful.  Th e f ed er al l aw s th at g ov er n t he na tu ra l g as an d e lec tric ity in du str ies ha ve n't changed much in the past decade, yet there has been a sweeping policy revolution in the way in which natural gas and electricity are sold and transported. The federal courts have told us that a just and reasonable price can be set by cost of service regulation  we know how to do that, and regulators did it for years, for good or for ill. But now, we have come to believe that markets can allocate resources and set efficient prices better than regulators. And in validating market based policy choices made by the FERC in Order Nos. 636 and 88 8, the federal courts have declared that a market-based approach can also prod uce a just and reaso nable outco me, b ut only if the m arket f unctio ns w ell eno ugh to actually discipline the price. And so now virtually all of the Commission's orders ask this foundational question either implicitly or explicitly: what policy choice will facilitate a well functioning market? This is the common thread in all of our decisionmaking.   -2Wh en w e certificate a new pipeline or L NG facility, we are motivated b y a desire to ens ure tha t the ga s ma rket ha s an a dequ ate inf rastruc ture. T he C aliforn ia electric ity crisis tha t bega n in the sum mer o f 20 00 m ade u s pain fully aw are tha t an ina dequ ate energy infrastructure can lead to soaring prices and unacceptable volatility. It also made us painfully aware of the limitations on our jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act. We cannot site electric transmission lines, even if they are vital to a we ll func tioning wh olesale mark et. Th at is left to th e states, a s is the sitin g of electric generation. We cannot ensure that there is sufficient intrastate take away capacity at interstate delivery points. A well functioning market requires the necessary interstate and intrastate infrastructure. We encourage states in this area, yet there is little we can do if a sta te f ail s to ac t. T hi s d iv isi on of au th or ity, w hi le p er ha ps po liti ca lly n ec es sa ry, som etime s frustra tes the d ecision mak ing n ecess ary for w ell fun ctionin g w holes ale markets. When we told pipelines in Order No. 637 that they must allow shippers to segment capacity, we did so with the needs of a well functioning market in mind. I could give scores of other examples. Our policy promoting the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations is aimed at facilitating independent, large regional platforms on which vibrantly competitive electricity markets can flourish. My point is that the policy evolution at FERC is focused on ensuring good markets for gas and electricity, and that will be the focus in the future as well. The Comm ission remains committed to making a market-based approach wo rk for energy consumers. This may seem obvious, yet in the wake of the California energy crisis and the demise of Enron, some are suggesting that energy deregulation is a failure. They argue that the California crisis was strike one, and that the Enron bankruptcy was strike two. The disaster in California taught us that the elements of a well functioning market mu st be in p lace f or co mp etition to d iscipline prices . Tho se elem ents ar e ade quate sup ply, su ffic ient t ran sm issio n ca pab ility, for wa rd c ont racti ng a nd a ppr opr iate h edg ing , good congestive management protocols, and a limited reliance on the spot market for meeting a purchaser's needs. The California crisis literally shouted to us that good markets that produce reasonable prices must be well structured. Federal and state policy makers must cooperate rather than blame each other. It does not mean, however, that the mo vem ent to c om petitive m arkets is a failu re. It me ans a bsolu tely that w e mu st redo uble our efforts to ensure that the market is structured to produce just and reasonable prices. Enron's demise is shocking and a disaster for many reasons, among them thousand s of w orkers lost their jobs an d retirement ne st eggs, and inv estors lost their   -3shirts. There are ce rtainly important policy lessons, but based upon w hat I've seen so f ar, these lessons seem to arise in other policy arenas such as retirement, accounting and securities regulation. All of these issues will be thoroughly investigated by Congress and federal agencies, as well they should be. Several members of Congress and some market participants are claiming that Enron may have used Enron Online or its broader market position to distort electric and gas m arkets in the W estern Un ited Sta tes. In res pon se, the C om missio n has recen tly opene d a broad investigation into w hether any entity manipulated We stern marke ts. In the co urse o f this inv estigatio n, w e w ill look a t both p hysical an d fina ncial m arkets , both short and long term. If En ron's de mise o ffers lesson s for o ur ev olving energ y policy, we mo st certain ly must heed those lessons. If there was market manipulation by any entity, we must uncover it as soon as possible and impose appropriate penalties. Based upon what I've seen so far, however, nothing persuades me that the Commission's general policy direction is unsound. I have seen no evidence that Enron's demise was a result of a flawed energy policy. Moreover, the market seemed to adjust well. Our largest energy trader failed, but other market participants quickly stepped in. It may be that some long term contracts still must be unraveled, but the energy market itself seemed to have the dep th an d fle xib ility to ad just w ell. Thus, the Commission remains undeterred. Although we have had bumps in the roa d, w e co ntin ue to belie ve th at a m ark et ba sed app roa ch h old s pro mis e fo r co nsu me rs. Unless Congress tells us to change policy directions, and I do not see that happening, we will continue to promote robust markets for gas and electricity. We will insist that cons um ers be nefit. If I may return now to the issue of our infrastructure, the tragic events of September 11 have brought a more immediate focus on the need to ensure that our critical energy infrastructure facilities  gas, electric, oil and hydroelectric  are protected from terrorist threats. On Sep temb er 14 , the C om missio n issue d a po licy stateme nt indic ating th at it would give ""its highest priority"" to processing any filing made for recovery of extraordinary expenditures to safeguard jurisdictional facilities. The Comm ission took another step to safeguard critical energy infrastructure on Oc tober 1 1 in an nou ncing that w e w ere lim iting ac cess to certain pub lic doc um ents containing specific information on energy facilities. Generally, this information consists   -4of m aps a nd o ther ge ogra phic d ata tha t wo uld h elp loc ate en ergy fac ilities. This information has been removed from the Commission' s website and the public reference ro om . H ow ev er , it r em ain s a va ila bl e u nd er th e F re ed om of In fo rm ati on A ct. O n J an ua ry 14, w e initiated an inq uiry into ho w th e Co mm ission s hou ld pro vide p ublic a ccess to critical energy infrastructure information while ensuring that this information cannot be misused by potential terrorists. The deadline for public comment on this notice expires shortly, and I am confident that we will receive many constructive suggestions. On October 12, the Commission issued an order approving the reactivation of the Cove Po int LNG fa cility. Our action, coming just one month after the terrorist attacks, stirred up a hornet's nest. We were besieged by criticism from Capitol Hill and local Maryland officials. The environmental analysis of the proposed plant reactivation prepared prior to September 11 specifically considered the impact of a terrorist act, and dismissed it as being remote. However, in view of the events of September 11, a number of parties sou ght rehearing of the certificate ord er. These p etitioners expressed concern about the proximity of Cove Point to the Calvert Cliffs nuclear generating facility located fo ur m ile s a w ay. W e to ok th es e c on ce rn s v er y se rio us ly. In the end, in response to these concerns, the Commission held a closed hearing on the safety implications of allowing LNG tankers to enter the Chesapeake Bay for deliveries at the facility. The Commission heard testimony from landowners, local offic ials, the F BI, C oast G uard , the N RC and e xper ts in LN G sa fety. We ultima tely determined that the facility could be operated safely, and does not pose a specific national se cu rity c on ce rn or a th re at t o t he se cu rity o f th e C alv er t C lif fs fa cil ity. At this point, the future of the Cove Point facility is in the hands of the U.S. Coast G ua rd w hi ch , al on g w ith th e D ep ar tm en t o f T ra ns po rta tio n, b ea rs t he re gu lat or y responsibility for approving the siting and safe operation of the dock and appurtenant facilities for offloading LNG from tankers.

In additio n to the Co ve P oint rea ctivation , the C om missio n has issued a certific ate autho rizing D ynegy's plans to con struct an d op erate L NG impo rt facilities a t its Ha ckbe rry, Louisia na ga s proc essing plant.   -5In a December, 2001 study, the EIA identified 13 new LNG facilities that have been proposed to serve U.S. markets. The study concludes that, even if only a few of thes e pr ojec ts are bui lt, the y cou ld still h ave a ve ry pos itive eff ect o n U .S. g as m ark ets. The high capital costs associated with LNG import facilities mean that they can be undertake n only by compa nies that have s trong balan ce sheets. N evertheless, it appears that a n um ber o f com panie s are g oing to un dertak e the c onstru ction o f LN G im port facilities. I lo ok f orw ard to e valua ting the se pro jects as th ey com e to us for ce rtificate approval. I expect LNG to increase in importance in meeting our energy needs in the years ahead. In addition to LNG impo rts, the Com mission has followed with some interest discu ssions on C apitol H ill conc erning wa ys to bring natura l gas fr om Alas ka to m arkets in the Lower 48 states. Several alternative pipeline routes exits, each one having a unique set of environmental and economic advantages and disadvantages. I have met with a number of potential Alaska gas pipeline sponsors, but thus far, none of the proposed pipelin e rou tes had been filed w ith the C om missio n. Th e only qu estion I have at this juncture is a business question, not a regulatory question: will the current price of natural gas support the construction of such facilities? My own view is that, once the economics justify such an investment, natural gas from Alaska will become an important means of meeting this nation's energy needs. As far as where the pipeline should be built, I have an open mind and w ill await the filing of certificate applications. I am generally pleased with the direction of our certificate policy. As the EIA has frequently reported, under virtually all economic scenarios, natural gas use increases dramatically over the next two decades, and substantial pipeline expansion will be required. The Commission is aware of this and is ready to process and evaluate 7c applications in a timely manner. Our processing time has decreased significantly over the pas t few years. T he to ugh est is sue con tinu es to be h ow to h and le lan dow ner con cern s. Th ese are e spe cially c ont entio ns w her e fa cilitie s m ust c ross hea vily po pul ated area s. Obviously, we must balance all concerns. Projects that serve the Northeast have been particularly challenging. Millennium Pipeline, for example, will interconnect with Con Edis on at a locatio n w ithin the dens ely popu lated C ity of M t. Vern on, m uch to the ch agrin of its citizenry. Certificating necessary pipeline facilities remains one of our most challenging jurisdictional arenas. Th e bottom line is that necessary pipeline infrastruc ture has to go somewhere, and we have to make some very tough siting decisions to meet our natio n's en erg y nee ds. L ast yea r, w e ce rtific ated 11.7 bcf/day in new capacity, and anoth er 7.1 b cf/da y is proposed for certification in 2002. These are significant additions to our nation's energy infrastructure.   -6Alt hou gh t he n atur al ga s m ark etpla ce a ppe ars to be f unc tion ing reas ona bly w ell, I do hav e a conc ern about the boom or bust cycle we have experienced with natural gas prices. You know the scenario. In 1998, wellhead prices stayed below $2.00 for much of the year, and the rig count dropped dramatically. Demand outpaced supply and prices rose sha rply in 2 000 . Th e rig cou nt th en in crea sed dra ma tically to we ll ov er 1 ,000 rigs, storage was filled, we have had a warm winter, and prices along with the rig count have aga in p lum me ted. O f co urse , you m igh t sim ply res pon d th at thi s is th e m ark et at w ork , and maybe it is. Yet, the price swings seem more volatile than in recent years, and such swin gs ca use p olitical rea ctions th at ultima tely are no t goo d fo r the m arket. We face a similar issue with electric markets. Electricity is critical to the social fabric of o ur na tion. W e w ant it to b e ava ilable an d reas onab ly priced. S om e vola tility is inevita ble, bu t extrem e vola tility over a su stained period is not u nacc eptab le. On e w ay to smo oth o ut the v olatility is with re serve requ ireme nts an d cap acity obliga tions. C apac ity markets are comp lex, but we need so me fea ture in our electricity market design to ensure that ad equa te gen erating capa city is being built. A capa city short m arket th at lead s to extrem e price volatility is not in the pu blic inter est. In gas and electricity markets, the peaks and valleys of course can be smoothed somewhat by appropriate hedging strategies, and we at FERC m ust ensure that pipeline bottlenecks do not keep prices artificially high. Timely certificate decisions are a ne ce ss ity. Now let me turn briefly to the issue of the standards of conduct for energy affiliates. Commission policy is to keep the pipeline and its gas marketing affiliate at arms leng th to guard a gainst self dealing . Unde r current policy, gas pipelines an d their mark eting a ffiliates m ust m aintain fun ctiona l separ ation, an d any inf orm ation d isclose d to a pipeline's marketing affiliate is disclosed simultaneously on the pipeline's website. Nev ertheless, there is a grow ing conc ern that the standa rds of con duct are insufficient to address the potential for self-dealing. This concern is fueled by the significant changes that have occurred in the energy industry. Mergers and consolidations in the gas and electric sectors have taken place at a brisk pace. Transmission providers often now have a number of gas and electric affiliates. Both physical and financial transactions by pipeline affiliates have burgeoned. The current regulations must be revised to govern the relationship between regulated transmission providers  both gas and electric  and all of their energy affiliates, not just their gas marketing affiliates. On Sep temb er 26 , we is sued a N otice o f Pro pose d R ulem aking to cov er all affiliates of the transmission provider. The Commission proposes to broaden the   -7definition of ""energy affiliate"" to prevent information concerning transmission operations or confidential customer information from being used to benefit any energy affiliate, inclu din g af filiate s en gag ed in fina ncia l trad ing of g as a nd e lectr icity ins trum ents . Pipeline affiliates that engage in electronic trading or energy-related financial transactions would be subject to the separation of function requirement and information sharing proh ibitions in the stan dard s of c ond uct. Our proposal is highly controversial. Pipelines assert that it is unnecessary and will have some unintended consequences. For example, they believe the proposed rule will limit legitimate dealings between a pipeline and its LDC affiliate. They raise num erou s othe r con cerns , as w ell. I have an open mind about this proposal. I must believe our affiliate standards must be updated, and so I support the basic thrust of our NOPR. W e must ensure, however, that we guard against any unintended consequences that would diminish legitimate operational efficiencies. We have received extensive comment, and now have a full record before us. Surely we can finalize this rule in the spring. Before I close, let me touch on a couple of other issues. A prominent feature of Order No. 637 was the removal of the price cap on secondary pipeline capacity. This was 2 year experiment that, by its terms, will sunset in September of this year. Extending the removal of the price cap would require a rulemaking. Our staff is now in the process of ev aluatin g the im pact o f this ex perim ent on the m arketp lace an d on cons um ers. I w ill await their recommendation. I had reservations about removing the cap in the first place, and will have to be persuaded that leaving it off is in the public interest. Does this policy make the market more liquid, or simply impose additional and unnecessary costs on consumers? W e will take up this issue in the next few months. Now, let me comment briefly on OCS issues. For years, the Commission has wre stled w ith the e xtent o f its auth ority to regu late on the O CS . A co uple o f years ag o, in a decision involving Sea Robin Pipeline, the C om missio n yet aga in attem pted to deline ate our primary function test as it applies to distinguish gathering from jurisdictional tran spo rtatio n, un der the N atur al G as A ct. W e are now bac k be for e the Co urt o f A ppe als. The case was recently argued, and we will await the Court's decision. Th e C om m iss io n's O C SL A ju ris di cti on ha s re ce nt ly b ee n c all ed in to qu es tio n b y a federal court. The Comm ission had adopted a rule that imposed a reporting requirement on OCS pipeline operators. We based the decision on the OCSLA's requirement that OCS pipelines may not discriminate in granting access to their pipelines. We reasoned that i t is po ssib le to s et tra nsp orta tion rates at su ch a hig h lev el as to p reclu de a cce ss,   -8which would be discriminatory and unlawful. The court did not buy our rationale and struck what could be a mortal blow to any regulatory oversight of OCS activities based on the O CS LA . I think w e sho uld ap peal. In conclusion, it is my view that under virtually any economic scenario, the long term future for natural gas appears very bright. The Comm ission is committed to completing the transition to seamless electric markets based upon the RTO platform, and this should provide significant trading opportunities for gas fired generation. There is a clear focus o n infrastructure issue s for both g as and elec tricity markets, and we are com mitted to issuin g certif icates in a time ly fashion for p rojects th at are in the pu blic interest. In the nine years I have been at the Commission, our focus has been on making markets work for consumers. We have had some setbacks, and we must heed the lessons that arise from crisis, bu t our fo cus re main s the sa me. T he m ain thin g is to k eep th e ma in thin g th e m ain th ing .

Burrql Kevin R Weir,"" and Earl C. Redman INTRODUCTION This report presents geochemical analyses from 516 stream-sediment, 29 pan-concentrate, and 1439 rock samples collected in the Haines-RI&wan-Porcupine area (fig. l), treats the results statisticialIy, and discusses various elemental concentrations and anomalies. The report is part of a cooperative project between the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) to evaluate the mineral resources of the Skagway subdistrict of the Juneau mining district. Samples were collected analyses have been reported (1984), Still and others (19X5), (1989), but a small amount of during 1981-1988, previously by Still Gilbert and others new analytical data with most being collected during 1984-1987. Most of these (1984a, 1984b), StiIl and others (1984), Redman and others (1987, 1988), Gilbert (1988), StilI (1988), and StiIl and others is also included in the report.  To evaulate the mineral resource potential of the Haines-Khrkwan-Porcupine area this report should be used with its companion report, ""Economic geology of Haines-ICI&wan-Porcupine area"" (Ah&a Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys Report of Investigations 91-4) by StiU and others (1991) and with the discussion of the study-area geology by Gilbert and others (1991). PREVIOUS WORK Geochemical studies in the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area previous to this cooperative study include analyses of Haines and Klukwan ultramafic rocks by Robertson (1956) and geochemical sample results from the Skagway B-3 and ChiIkat Peninsula areas by Winkler and MacKevett (1970), MacKevett (1971), and MacKevett and others (1974). Reconnaissance hydrogeochemical and stream-sediment analyses from the study area are reported as part of the National Uranium Resource Evaluation Program U.S. Department of Energy (US DOE, 1981). Geochemical analyses from the adjacent area east of the study area are reported by Gilbert and others (1990), and from the adjacent area to the south by Brew and others (1978). METHODOLOGY This report includes geochemical analyses from most mineral occurrences within the Haines-KIukwanPorcupine area and from reconnaissance stream-sediment, pan-concentrate, bedrock float, and bedrock samples collected during geologic mapping and prospect and deposit evaluation (see StiU and others, 1989, for sampling and processing techniques). Most geochemical analyses from the study-area deposits and prospects are reported in the companion to this report (Still and others, 1991). Although there is a concentration of stream-sediment samples from known placer areas in the western part of the study area, an effort was made to provide sample coverage for ah accessible drainages within the study area, However, bedrock float and bedrock samples are strongly biased toward samples that exhibited iron staining or visible sulfides. Multiple samples were commonly collected at mineralized localities. This report includes analyses for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and barium (tables 1-4)4, although some samples, primarily from plutonic rocks, were analyzed for molybdenum (table 5). Some samples collected within areas containing ultramatic rocks were also analyzed for piatinum and palladium (table 6).

Copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma analysis and barium by X-ray flourescence.  Four different laboratories processed the samples presented in this report, Samples collected during 198183 and some samples collected during 1984 were analyzed by the USBM, Reno Research Center, Nevada.  3   Most of the remaining 1984 samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the DGGS Geochemistry Laboratory in Fairbanks for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and molybdenum, Some 1984 samples from the Porcupine area were analyzed for gold (by fire assay) and for barium (by X-ray fluorescence) by Bondar-Clegg, Inc., Lakewood, Colorado. Most samples collected during 198588 were analyzed by Bondar-Clegg. For these samples, gold was analyzed by fire assay; silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt and molybdenum by atomic-absorption spectroscopy; and barium by X-ray flourescence. A few samples (mainly of plutonic rocks) collected during 1984-87 were analyzed by X-Ray Assay Laboratories, Ontario, Canada. Gold was analyzed by fire assay - direct-current plasma analysis, silver by direct-current plasma analysis, and copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, barium, and molybdenum by X-ray flourescence.  ANOMALIES Anomaly threshold levels for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and barium were determined by a combination of factors. Because only a few samples were analyzed for molybdenum, platinum, and palladium, anomaly thresholds were not calculated for these elements. The primary statistical tools used to determine threshold levels for anomalous values were univariate statistics and histograms of analytical value versus frequency of occurrence. These histograms (figs. 2-15) Sallow rapid visual inspection for significant breaks and tailing out of values; they can also be compared with histograms from previous studies made to the south of the study area, in the Alexander Terrane (Brew and others, 1978) and the Taku Terrane (Grybeck and others, 1984). Because samples were derived from different geologic terranes and rock types, stream-sediment and panconcentrate samples were segregated into two groups those from the metamorphic-plutonic Alexander terrane south and west of the Chilkat fault (Porcupine area), and those from the plutonic-volcanic Taku terrane north and east of the Chilkat fault (Haines-Klukwan area) (Monger and Berg, 1987). Anomalous values of streamsediment samples were selected from natural breaks that generally fell between the 95th and 98th percentile on the histograms (table 1). Bedrock samples were segregated into 11 major lithologic types within the two terranes (table 1). Because of the strong bias of bedrock samples toward mineralized specimens, anomalous bedrock values were generally selected on the basis of natural breaks at the upper end of the distribution of values (table 1). Thirty-five percent of all bedrock samples are anomalous in one or more elements, and most bedrock sample anomalies would be considered ""highly anomalous"" when compared to similar studies that have identified ""weakly anomalous"" and ""distinctly"" or ""highly anomalous"" values (Grybeck and others, 1984; Still and others, 1989). Bedrock float samples were not included in calculation of bedrock anomalies, and most would be anomalous in one or more elements when compared with in-place bedrock samples. As source indicators, bedrock float samples are plotted together with stream-sediment and pan-concentrate samples on sheet 1. Because of the variation between individual laboratories and between analytical methods, there is considerable variation in detection limits within the sample population. However, lower detection limits for all elements analyzed, except gold, were far below anomaly threshold levels. Lower detection limits for gold varied from 0.001 to 0.1 ppm; thus, the threshold anomaly level for gold was arbitrarily set at 0.1 ppm for all samples, This level is higher than generally calculated for gold, and readers should examine tables 2-4 when assessing gold potential in the study area.  STREAM-SEDIMENT SAMPLES In both the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan parts of the study area about 6 percent of the stream-sediment samples are anomalous in gold (0.1 ppm or above). Anomalous samples are scattered throughout the study 5Histogramn are on pages 58-75.   area, with minor concentrations in the Shakyseyi Creek area in the southern Takshanuk Mountains and near the Road Cut prospect on the Chilkat Peninsula (Still and others, 1991). However, there is a concentration of detected but nonanomalous gold from drainages with known placer production in the Porcupine area and near the Road Cut prospect on the Chilkat Peninsula (table 2, sheet 1). The Porcupine area contains elevated background silver values when compared with the Haines-Klukwan area, resulting in significantly different anomalous threshold values in the two parts of the study area (fig. 3, table 1). In the Porcupine are, silver anomalies are generally scattered throughout the known placer-producing drainages, whereas the Haines-Klukwan area has a concentration of anomalies on the Chilkat Peninsula (table 2, sheet 1). The Haines-Klukwan area exhibits significantly higher background copper values than the Porcupine area (fig. 4). Although widely scattered throughout the study area, anomalies tend to be concentrated in creeks in the Haines-Klukwan area that drain mafic metavolcanic bedrock (Gilbert and others, 1991) (table 2, sheet 1). Lead is slightly elevated in stream-sediment samples in the Porcupine area compared to the Haines Klukwan area (fig. 5). Fourteen of seventeen lead anomalies are from the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages in the Porcupine area (table 2, sheet 1). Compared to the Haines-Klukwan area, the Porcupine area has significantly elevated zinc values; its threshold zinc anomaly level is four times higher (table 1, fig. 6). About 10 percent of stream-sediment samples from the Porcupine area are anomalous in zinc. Zinc anomalies are concentrated in streams that drain finegrained, argillaceous Paleozoic rocks (Gilbert and others, 1991) (table 2, sheet 1). Cobalt concentrations from stream-sediment samples from the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan parts of the study area are similar (fig. 7). Four percent of samples from the Porcupine area (mainly in the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages) are anomalous in cobalt, whereas about one percent from the Haines-Klukwan area are anomalous. About one-half of the stream-sediment and pan-concentrate samples in the study area were analyzed for barium. Background barium values and anomaly threshold values are higher in the Porcupine area than in the Haines-Klukwan area (table 1, fig. 8). All barium anomalies are located in the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages in the Porcupine area (table 2, sheet 1). BEDROCK SAMPLES  Bedrock geochemical samples were separated into 11 lithologic catagories, five found only in the Porcupine area (Alexander terrane), four found only in the Haines-U&wan area (Taku terrane), and two found in both parts of the study area but located mainly in the Porcupine area (figs. 9-15). The strong bias of bedrock geochemical samples toward samples displaying mineralization has resulted in a bedrock population with average elemental values far above normal background levels and threshold anomaly levels above those previously calculated for these samples (Still and others, 1989). In the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area, 68 of 8% bedrock samples (about 8 percent) are anomalous (above 0.1 ppm) in gold (table 4, figs. 9a-b). In the Haines-Klukwan area, however, about 28 percent of bedrock samples are anomalous in gold, primarily from mafic volcanic rocks and quartz veins in the southern Takshanuk Mountains the Chilkat Peninsula (table 4, sheet 2). Bedrock samples from the Haines-Klukwan area are twice as likely to be anomalous in silver as those from the Porcupine area, largely because of the numerous mineralized quartz veins and plutonic rocks there (table 4, sheet 2, fig. lob). In the Porcupine area the average background concentration of silver in argillaceous rocks is high, but quartz veins and carbonate-skarn samples yielded most of the silver anomalies (fig. lOa, table 4, sheet 2).  5   Background copper levels are higher for all lithologies in the Haines-Klukwan area than those in the Porcupine area (figs. lla-b, table l), and samples from Haines-Klukwan are three times as likely to be anomalous in copper. Samples anomalous in copper in the Haines-Klukwan area are primarily from quartz veins, plutonic rocks, and basalt (fig. llb, table 4, sheet 2). Background lead levels are slightly higher for rocks from the Porcupine area than for the Haines-Klukwan area; 40 of the 65 samples anomalous in lead are from the Porcupine area (figs. 12a-b, table 1). A large proportion of lead anomalies are from samples of felsic volcanic rocks and quartz veins (table 4, sheet 2). Most lithologies from the Porcupine area exhibit markedly higher zinc background levels than do samples from the Haines-Klukwan area (figs. 13a-b, table 1). Except for ultramafic rocks in the Haines-Klukwan area, zinc anomalies are found in all litholgies (table 4, sheet 2). There is little noticeable difference in background cobalt levels between samples from the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan areas (table 1, figs. 14a-b). However, 68 of 70 samples anomalous in cobalt are scattered amoung various lithologies in the Porcupine area (table 4, sheet 2). Seventy-seven percent of bedrock samples in the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area were analyzed for barium. Barium concentrations are elevated in felsic volcanic rocks, chert, and, in particular, argillaceous rocks from the Porcupine area (figs. 15a-b, table 1). Thirty-four of 36 samples anomalous in zinc are found in various lithologies in the Porcupine area (table 4, sheet 2).  CONCLUSION The southern and western parts of the study area (Porcupine area) is underlain by metamorphic and plutonic rocks of the Alexander terrane and yields stream-sediment values higher in silver, lead, zinc, and barium than the northern and eastern parts of the study area. Bedrock samples in this area are also relatively enriched in lead, zinc, and barium. Stream-sediment and bedrock samples from the northern and eastern parts of the study area (Haines-Klukwan area), which is part of the volcanic-plutonic Taku terrane, are relatively enriched in copper. No clear diffference in gold and cobalt concentrations between the two terranes is suggested by stream-sediment-sample analyses, but a high proportion of bedrock samples samples from the Haines-Klukwan area are anomalous in gold and silver. The Porcupine area produces most bedrock samples anomalous in cobalt.
