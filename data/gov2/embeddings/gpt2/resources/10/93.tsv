GX244-12-13779335	"Chesapeake Bay                           Chesapeake Bay Monitoring       ""Monitoring for Management Actions""                          1. introduction        The State of Maryland is actively pursuing a management policy to protect       and restore the economic and recreational value of Chesapeake Bay. To       assist in this goal, the Maryland Office of Environmental Programs (OEP)       has designed and implemented a Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring       Program. The purpose of this program is to provide State managers and       policy makers with accurate, timely and comprehensive information about the       Bay's existing condition and how it is responding to management       initiatives. This information is required to evaluate current management       policies and to formulate new goals and policies in the future. Perhaps       most importantly, the results of the monitoring effort will provide a       yardstick with which to measure progress towards the ultimate goal of       protecting and restoring Chesapeake Bay.

Measurable       progress can be expected only when this information is used in the       development, implementation and evaluation of management actions.       Furthermore, the struggle toward progress will be difficult in the face of       mounting population pressures. A long-term commitment to develop and       maintain technically sound management plans is the only real hope for       success in restoring vitality to Chesapeake Bay.              Presented here are the results of the first two years of the monitoring       program.  During this period (summer 1984 through summer 1986) a major       campaign has been initiated to reveal the present condition of the Bay in       quantitative terms, to assess how the Bay is changing in response to       management decisions, and to determine the causes of the current decline.       At this early stage in the program, an unprecedented understanding of the       Bay's current condition has already been achieved. It is this developing       understanding of current conditions that will be the focus of this report.       Future reports will examine in more detail the Bay's response to management       actions and some of the underlying causes of the Bay's problems.               PROGRAM FORMULATION              In order to insure that the OEP effort is capable of supporting effective       management actions, it is imperative that the program be logically       formulated. Past experiences indicate that the probability of success in       satisfying this program's objective will be enhanced because the following       elements were considered during the initial program design:          A clear statement of the relevant  management      issues  to be addressed,           The development of specific  management      questions  that define the information needed      for management actions,          The  design  of a technically sound and practical sampling program,          A timely  analysis, interpretation  and presentation of  results,  and         The development of  management policies       and actions.   The remainder of this chapter will present a discussion of each of these       five elements using examples to demonstrate the actual processes that were       followed. A further discussion of the last step, development of management       actions and policies, will be presented in the  final chapter .            MANAGEMENT ISSUES              The first task that managers and scientists face before they can initiate       efforts to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay and its major       tributaries is to clearly define what the major management issues are.       Success in restoring the Bay will logically depend on a clear       conceptualization of the problems we are trying to correct. This       conceptualization of the management issues will then lead to specific       actions that are perceived as necessary to bring about a recovery. Of       course, the definition of management issues and management actions will       significantly impact the design of the monitoring program and the ultimate       application and utility of the monitoring results.              In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency and the States of Maryland and       Virginia completed a seven year, $27 million program to characterize the       existing state of the Bay, to study the causes of the observed declines in       the Bay, and to propose strategies needed to begin corrective measures.       Relying on available historical data and supplemental information collected       by the EPA/States program, the major management issues were identified as:            Declining levels of oxygen in Bay waters,          Increasing levels of phytoplankton (microscopic plants) due to nutrient       enrichment,          The presence of toxic materials, and          Declines in living resources.   Once the broad management issues were defined, there was a need to develop       more specific questions that would guide future management actions and       serve as a focus for evaluating their success or failure. Answers to these       management questions are the pieces of information necessary to develop       technically sound actions and policies.               MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS              Management questions were formulated for each of the major management       issues presented above. Consideration was given to the information already       available from existing monitoring and research programs. Some of the       management questions were relatively well studied by the State, and       sufficient information was available to continue existing management plans.       For several of the management questions, the available data was determined  to be insufficient to develop revised or new management strategies.              To illustrate the concept, examples of management questions formulated for       each of the management issues are given below:              Decreasing Oxygen Levels:            Where are the major areas of low dissolved oxygen waters in the Chesapeake       Bay      System?       Is the areal extent of low dissolved oxygen water expanding over time?       Which pollutant inputs are most responsible for the low oxygen conditions?        Increasing Phytoplankton Levels:            Where are phytoplankton blooms a major problem?       Has the severity of phytoplankton blooms in impacted areas, such as the      Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, decreased since 1980 when management       initiatives      were being implemented?       What is the relationship between nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass?   Toxicants:            Where are the major concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments of the      Bay?       Are toxicants levels in the sediments of historically impacted areas, such       as      Baltimore Harbor, decreasing?       Are toxicants that are accumulating in the sediments also entering the food      chain?   Resources:            Where is striped bass spawning succeeding or failing in the Bay system?       Are oyster stocks declining?       What environmental factors, for example food resources and acidity, are      correlated with spawning success of fish in nursery regions?                                                Examination of the spectrum of major management questions revealed that       they could be separated into 3 major categories:            Questions about the spatial and temporal characterization of each problem          Questions about observed trends in time          Questions about processes and causes relating to the major management       issues   These three categories of management questions thus became the guiding       objectives for designing the monitoring program. The specific physical,       chemical and biological components of Bay water quality that were chosen       for monitoring were those considered necessary to adequately address the       major management issues.              The first two objectives of the monitoring program - characterization and       trend - were considered to be goals that were fully-achievable by the       monitoring program. At this time an initial characterization using the       monitoring results is possible, although we will achieve greater confidence       and reliability in this assessment with several years of data. The initial       characterization is the subject of this report. The identification of       trends will be an ongoing objective as management actions are continually       being evaluated. The third objective - processes and causes - requires a       synthesis of monitoring data with research and modeling programs to achieve       definitive answers to most management questions in this category. There are       also management questions that are not fully covered under the water       quality program such as those related to living resources; these questions       are being addressed by other State programs specific to this problem.       Nonetheless, there are important questions relating to living resources       that cannot be answered without the comprehensive perspective of the       current water quality monitoring program.               DESIGN OF SAMPLING PROGRAM                The design of the present monitoring program is predicated upon the       management issues and questions discussed above. The program will only be       successful to the degree that it can ultimately respond with sound answers       to the management questions being posed. Thus, in assembling the program       details, the attainment of these answers was always the foremost       consideration.              To reach its stated goals, it is essential that the program be technically       sound. State-of-the-art scientific knowledge was incorporated into all       phases of the monitoring design to assure technically defensible results.       For each discipline contained in the monitoring program, OEP scientists       solicited technical reviews from recognized experts.              To be implemented effectively and sustained for the time necessary to yield       results, the monitoring program also needs to be logistically and       economically practical. This means that the program is scaled properly, is       efficient, measures the minimum number of the meaningful variables, and is       flexible enough to change when necessary.              Finally, the complex physical, chemical and biological processes       characteristic of estuarine systems must be considered in the design of an       effective monitoring program. Without a solid understanding of how these       processes influence the selection of variables to be measured, sampling       frequencies, measurement methods, and data analyses techniques, the results       will have limited application to management policy formulations. A       description of these important processes and how they influence the       problems facing Chesapeake Bay is contained in the    next     chapter .              A brief description of the overall program design is presented in         Chapter       3 . In each subsequent chapter that addresses elements of the monitoring       program, more specific aspects of the program design are discussed prior to       the presentation of results.               ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION, AND RESULTS              A critical step that determines the usefulness of the monitoring program is       the analysis of date, interpretation of the findings and presentation of       results. This final link is necessary to bring the wealth of information       collected under the monitoring program into coherent and usable products.       These products complete the sequence of events that allow the program to       fulfill its objective of providing management with a valuable planning and       assessment tool. Too often, ambitious and well-intentioned programs have       floundered at this crucial final stage.              In order for the monitoring data to be used in the decision making process,       it must first be meaningfully analyzed by one or more objective techniques.       For some applications, a simple graphical analysis may suffice because the       patterns are obvious or the analysis is exploratory in nature such as       examining potential cause and effect relationships. Graphical analysis is       also valuable for the preliminary phases of data analysis when, in many       cases, insufficient data is available to warrant specific statistical       tests. Graphical representations of the data are the principal products in       this report because we are presently in the preliminary phases of data       analysis.              In more rigorous levels of data analysis, objective statistical techniques       are applied to evaluate hypotheses. Hypotheses, in the context of the       monitoring program, are simply a formulation of the management questions       into a statistically testable statement. For example, one of the management       questions stated above concerning increased phytoplankton levels and the       effectiveness of management initiatives since 1980 could be formulated into       the following specific hypothesis: Phytoplankton levels in the tidal fresh       area of the Potomac River during summer have not changed since 1980. An       appropriate statistical test could then be applied to either accept or       reject this hypothesis. If the hypothesis was rejected and levels actually       were shown to decline since 1980, the management question concerning trends       in phytoplankton for this region would be answered. The use of statistics       must be very carefully applied, however, paying particular attention to the       assumptions of each technique in relation to the data that is available       from the monitoring program. In fact, the requirements of statistical       testing was one of the critical factors considered in the program's design       to insure that appropriate data would be collected.              Once the monitoring data has been analyzed, the results must be interpreted       in the context of the management decisions that will depend upon this       information. Often, there will be numerous specific results from several       different monitoring elements that must be synthesized into a unified       finding about a particular management issue. It is also important that the       results from the monitoring data be accompanied by some statement of the       confidence, or scientific uncertainty, that should be associated with a       particular finding. Confidence in the findings could include limits on the       estimates of particular measurements of the Bay's condition or limits on       the geographical locations to which a result may apply.              Finally, the interpretation of results should conclude with recommendations       for management policies. This is the culmination of the sequence of events       upon which that entire program is based. It presents managers with a       suggested course of action based upon the careful evaluation of monitoring       results. Of course, there are other considerations, as will be discussed in       the following paragraphs, that also influence the final decisions on       management policies and actions.               MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS              The degree to which OEP's monitoring program results are incorporated into       the formulation of management policy and actions directed towards Bay       restoration will determine the true efficacy of the program.              In almost all management decisions aimed at restoring the Bay, several       issues must be considered. First, there is the technical foundation for the       decision. This is where the monitoring program is expected to be a powerful       tool. Sometimes the monitoring data will be used in conjunction with       computer models to provide an added dimension of forecasting the outcome of       a variety of potential management strategies. Results from research studies       may also provide technical input in the area of cause-and-effect       relationships.              Other important considerations that will bear upon a final management       policy are the priorities of citizens who could be affected by the       decision, the economics of the decision and the available technology to       support the implementation of a particular management policy.              In the end, however, it is the monitoring program that will provide the       verdict on the success of individual or collective management decisions.       These evaluations will either lead to a strengthening of our original       management positions or to a reformulation of strategies to provide more       effective measures aimed at restoring the Bay's health.              A more detailed description of the strategies that will be used in the       development of policies and management actions will be the subject of the        final chapter .

GX268-78-7245938	"MARYLAND COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT P ROGRAM SECTION 309 STRATEGY (2000-2005)  May 3, 2001  Prepared by: Coastal Zone Management Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Maryland Department of Natural Resources Tawes State Office Building, E-2 Annapolis, MD 21401   Introduction The Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program has identified two general areas to concentrate efforts for the Section 309 Coastal Enhancement Strategy: (1) Coastal Hazards - shore erosion, hazard mitigation strategies, and sea level rise and (2) Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - watershed restoration action strategies. Each of these areas were identified as a high priority during the State's Section 309 Assessment, which reviewed and commented on all nine enhancement areas found in the Coastal Zone Management Act. This strategy focuses on filling gaps recognized under these enhancement areas in the Assessment. In addition, the Assessment identified two areas where future Section 309 Strategies may be appropriate: Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - Marine Protected Areas and Public Access. At this time, there is not enough information to develop complete strategies for these initiatives; however, Maryland feels that these initiatives are important. With this in mind, the Maryland CZM Program will use other resources to begin research into these enhancement areas. The State reserves the right to add these initiatives to the 2001-2005 Section 309 Strategy at a later date, if deemed appropriate. Overview of Proposed Budget The following table is an overview of a Strategy. Section 309 Enhancement Area Coastal Hazards - Shore Erosion, Hazard Mitigation Planning and Sea Level Rise Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - Watershed Restoration Action Strategies Totals Strategy Format The remainder of this strategy will be divided into the two Section 309 enhancement areas. For each, the following components are included: (1) summary of problem, (2) proposed program changes, (3) anticipated effects, (4) appropriateness of program change, (5) fiscal and technical needs, (6) budget, (7) workplan, and (8) likelihood of success. proposed budget for the 2001-2005 Maryland Section309 FY 2001 $250,000 FY 2002 $250,000 FY 2003 $250,000 FY 2004 $250,000 FY 2005 $250,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  2   C S Issue Summary HORE  OASTAL  E  ROSION  HAZARDS AND SEA LEVEL R  ISE  The coastal zone in Maryland comprises 66% of the total land area of the State. Bordering this coastal area is over 4,300 miles of shoreline along the Atlantic Ocean, coastal bays and Chesapeake Bay, and its tributaries. These shoreline areas are affected by a variety of hazards, particularly coastal erosion and sea level rise. Coastal hazards represent significant threats to resources and infrastructure in Maryland's coastal zone. Shoreline erosion is an ongoing problem; Maryland loses approximately 260 acres of land each year to shore erosion. The unconsolidated nature of many shoreline sediments make them particularly susceptible to erosive forces. In addition, extensive stretches of shoreline are exposed to a large fetch and thereby are threatened by both storm-induced erosion and chronic wave action. The impacts of erosion include the loss of land and its associated economic, cultural and ecological values and degraded water quality resulting from increased sediment and nutrient loads. Reduced water quality, in turn, impacts living resources. Shore erosion is compounded by the effects of sea level rise, which increases the areas exposed to and affected by erosion. The historical average rate of sea level rise in Maryland is between 3-4 mm per year or 1 foot per century, a rate nearly twice the global average. However, current scientific research shows that continued climate change will accelerate sea level rise rates, resulting in a rise of two to three feet along Maryland's shores by the year 2100 (Leatherman et al., 1995). Currently, the State does not have a comprehensive approach to either managing shore erosion or addressing the impacts of sea level rise. A coordinated approach to coastal hazard mitigation is necessary to effectively and efficiently manage coastal resources and plan future development. Proposed Program Changes The proposed Coastal Hazards Strategy includes three main components: (1) development of a comprehensive shore erosion management plan; (2) adoption and implementation of sea level rise response recommendations; and (3) development or update of local hazard mitigation plans. A statewide Comprehensive Shore Erosion Management Plan will be developed for adoption by Maryland. This will be a multi-year effort requiring the collection of new data and the development of new products from existing data sets. Development of a comprehensive plan will be accomplished by: (1) collecting and interpreting critical data and information; (2) developing a sea level rise predictive model; (3) developing and executing regional management strategies; and (4) continuing and expanding public outreach and education activities. 3   Second, the Department of Natural Resources recently adopted the 2000 document entitled Sea Level Response Strategy for Maryland as a guideline for addressing sea level rise issues in the state. The Strategy outlines a number of key activities which could be undertaken to further sea level rise planning, including: outreach and engagement; technology, data, and research support; targeting ongoing state initiatives to include sea level rise response mechanisms; and amending existing state and local statutes related to coastal hazards and resource management. This four-pronged approach will result in an integrated policy to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. Concurrent with state-level planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise, local governments will identify areas at risk for coastal flooding and storm surge events through development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans. Very few coastal communities currently have hazard mitigation plans because they lack either the resources or the expertise to develop effective plans. The few plans that have been developed need to be updated and reviewed for sufficiency and effectiveness. In coordination with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Department of the Environment and coastal counties, Coastal Zone Management Section 309 funding will be used to aid in the development of approximately two Local Hazard Mitigation Plans at the county level per year. These plans will serve as a mechanism to further state planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise mitigation and will reduce future local impacts associated with coastal hazards. Anticipated Effects of Program Change The efforts described in this strategy address critical and long term issues including future coastal development and land use; natural resource protection; public safety; and infrastructure repair and replacement cost management. The initial collection of data and information and the subsequent development of a comprehensive shore erosion control plan and local hazard mitigation plans and the adoption and implementation of sea level rise strategy recommendations will provide critical tools to state and local managers. Anticipated outcomes include:  Regional Shore Erosion Control Planning: Partnerships between DNR and local governments will be expanded to include all counties in Maryland. Through these partnerships, Maryland CZM will prioritize stretches of shoreline for erosion control activities, review ongoing planning initiatives, create impact pilot studies, develop ranking criteria, and utilize modeling tools to evaluate stretches of shoreline for shore erosion control. The final product will identify strategies for shore erosion control to be used along particular stretches of shoreline. These strategies may include: structural and non-structural erosion control devices, designation of natural erosion areas, land acquisition, and establishment of local erosion-based setback requirements.  Development of a Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan: The regional plans described above will be combined and incorporated into a statewide Comprehensive Shore Erosion Management Plan. The Comprehensive Plan will provide statewide focus for managing state financial and technical support for local communities and identifying local areas of state concern. The Plan will also provide the opportunity for information sharing between similarly affected 4         counties. Sea Level Rise Data Collection and Modeling: LIDAR data will be collected to provide detailed elevation contours for coastal counties. The newly-acquired topographic data will be used to create a model that will identify areas potentially vulnerable to increased erosion due to sea level rise and other on-going coastal processes. Implementation of Sea Level Rise Response Mechanisms: The Maryland CZM will follow through on appropriate recommendations outlined in the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland, including increased public outreach and technical assistance as well as working to target ongoing state initiatives to include sea level rise response mechanisms. Development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans: Several state agencies will coordinate with local communities to develop Local Hazard Mitigation Plans to identify and plan for an assortment of hazards including coastal hazards.  Improved planning in all these areas will result in reduced financial losses to both public and private entities, fewer losses of natural resources through habitat protection, increased emergency management information, and improved coordination and cooperation between management entities. Appropriateness of Program Change A number of documents recently completed by the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program and other state agencies highlight the need for improved planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise. First, the Final Report of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force (2000) and the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland (2000) both found deficiencies in Maryland's current management framework to control shore erosion and plan for sea level rise. Problems included: use of a site-by-site approach; lack of coordination and duplication of effort among agencies with jurisdiction; lack of information and understanding of the issues associated with shore erosion and sea level rise; lack of public outreach; and, lack of funding. Second, the State of Maryland Hazard Mitigation Plan (2000) identified and summarized environmental hazards throughout the State, reviewed the existing capacity to deal with these hazards and outlined suggestions for additional efforts. Finally, the Maryland CZM Section 309 Assessment for Coastal Hazards built on the findings of the documents described above and identified the need to continue to plan for and manage coastal erosion, to further develop response strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise, and to support development of local hazard mitigation plans. The Section 309 Strategy for Coastal Hazards is designed to further develop the findings in these reports through coordination with on-going state initiatives and to implement many of their recommendations. The most effective way to promote and implement these recommendations is to use the reports as working documents, implementing some recommendations as opportunities develop and modifying others as conditions require. Section 309 funding will aid in both the creation and identification of these opportunities. Continuing the work represented by these reports will provide continuity and momentum for efforts related to coastal hazard management. 5   Fiscal and Technical Needs Although state, federal, and local resources have already been allocated toward aspects of or precursors to the activities and needs outlined above, additional funding will be needed to ensure completion the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, implementation of sea level rise response strategies, and development of local hazard mitigation plans. Currently, both State and local governments lack critical data and information needed to develop accurate and defensible coastal hazards related plans for shore erosion control and sea level rise. Both the Final Report of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force and the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland identified gaps in knowledge regarding shore erosion and sea level rise. These documents outlined the need for the following information:  updated shore erosion rates and associated maps;  boat wake impacts on shore erosion rates;  role of submerged aquatic vegetation in mitigating erosion impacts;  development of a database to manage dredge material need and availability;  evaluation of durability and effectiveness of shore erosion control methods;  benefit-cost analysis of construction projects identified in the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan;  development of long-term funding strategies to manage shore erosion;  detailed coastal elevation data (i.e., LIDAR data);  impact of groundwater withdrawal on land subsidence and sea level rise; and  development of a sea level rise predictive model. These data will be used to develop analytical tools used to complete the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and to implement the sea level rise response measures. Additional funding will be required to provide support and technical assistance to communities developing local hazard mitigation plans. Budget Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan Support for this activity will include data and information collection (as outlined above), development and implementation of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, public outreach and workshop development, organization and implementation. Approximately $150,000 per year would be funded under the Coastal Zone Management Act Section 309 Strategy. The remainder would be funded through other sources. Expenditures over five years may include: Updated erosion rates: Boat wake data SAV study Dredge database Sea level rise model $160,000 $ 40,000 $ 30,000 $ 20,000 $ 60,000 6   Outreach Staff Staff support  $ 31,500 $123,000 $ 35,500  Please see Attachment A, Six Year Budget for Implementation of the Recommendations of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force, for a complete, detailed Shore Erosion Planning budget for Maryland. Sea Level Rise Recommendations No specific funding is requested for this activity at this time. However, activities involving sea level rise will be part of the development of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and development of local hazard mitigation plans (see below), including the development of a sea level rise predictive model and incorporation of sea level rise projections in hazard mitigation planning. Specific recommendations listed in the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy will be pursued as conditions warrant and opportunities are presented but will largely require only staff time. Hazard Mitigation Planning Planning and outreach costs will be approximately $100,000 per year to support working with two counties or municipalities. Workplan Following is a general workplan and description of activities for the three main components of the coastal hazards strategy the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, implementation of sea level rise recommendations, and development of local hazard mitigation plans. Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan The initial analysis of information and data along with the methodologies developed through the ongoing partnerships with two coastal counties will provide templates for developing broader regional and statewide approaches. Additional county partners will be sought and plans will be developed for the remaining coastal areas in Maryland. The project will occur in five phases: (1) shore erosion data collection and modeling, to ensure that planning is based on up-to-date, comprehensive information; (2) sea level rise data collection and modeling; (3) creation and implementation of the Comprehensive Plan; (4) on-going public outreach to ensure the input of local communities into the development of these plans; and (5) analysis of long-term financial needs for shore erosion control. The estimate above includes the costs of data acquisition, staff time and public outreach activities outlined by the Task Force. Implementation of the Task Force recommendations is not possible without the required data, nor without the associated staff time and public outreach. Sea Level Rise Recommendations Issues related to sea level rise will be incorporated into the local hazard mitigation plans as well as the 7   development of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan. Since these two efforts are statewide in scope and will address all of the coastal areas in Maryland likely to face significant impacts from sea level rise, consideration of sea level rise in these two planning activities will serve as an invaluable initial response to this issue. In addition to the above initiatives, efforts will be made to continue developing incentives for including consideration of sea level rise in local land use plans and ordinances and to work to protect coastal habitats, such as wetlands, from the impacts of climate change. Modifications of local and/or state statutes may be required to include such provisions. The recent adoption of the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland as a working document by the Department of Natural Resources provides added visibility and support to furthering specific recommendations outlined in this document. Hazard Mitigation Planning The Maryland Emergency Management Agency's State of Maryland Hazard Mitigation Plan rated 14 counties and municipalities at a high to medium risk for coastal flooding and/or storm surge impacts. Section 309 funding will be utilized to develop local hazard mitigation plans in these localities. Local and state hazard mitigation planning teams will be convened to collect information and develop strategies based on local conditions and resources. The hazard mitigation planning teams will include both state and local government representatives as well as local citizens to ensure local input and ultimate acceptance of the plan elements. Public outreach will also be conducted during the development of the local plans to collect a wide range of public input, address local concerns and include additional information or data. The local plans will incorporate available data, including that from the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and sea level rise predictive model, as well as other information developed over the course of this strategy. Likelihood of Success Interest and concern for sea level rise, coastal erosion and other coastal hazard issues are increasing both nationally and locally. In Maryland specifically, the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force was formed in response to citizen concern about erosion. Sea level rise was incorporated into the new Chesapeake Bay 2000 Agreement, which includes provisions for examining global climate change and the potential impacts on wetland habitats. And in general, heightened emphasis on mitigative solutions in lieu of post-disaster relief efforts points to the need to better plan for coastal hazards. With public input, significant accomplishments in planning for coastal hazards have already been achieved in Maryland and a number of state agencies and their local partners are poised to maintain the momentum to include coastal hazard issues in state and local plans and ordinances. For example, coordinated efforts and partnering between the Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Department of the Environment and several counties will be used to address specific mitigation measures for sea level rise.  8   Continuing visibility of sea level rise, shore erosion and coastal flooding issues in the local and national press provide increased popular understanding and exposure to issues related to this strategy. Outreach is being developed for federal, state and local legislators, their staff, and the public to improve understanding of coastal hazards issues in Maryland and generate widespread support for related initiatives. Planning for shore erosion control is underway. Currently, the Department of Natural Resources has partnered with two coastal counties and local citizens groups to begin creation of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan. The tools and methodologies developed under these partnerships were designed to be easily transferrable to a statewide planning process and will serve as models for implementation of the Shore Erosion Task Force recommendations statewide. Sea level rise issues were recently identified as a priority area for the Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee, a standing advisory group developed to provide the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program with citizen, local government, and business input. This group has reviewed the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland and has recommended that the issues continue to be pursued by the state. Combining shore erosion management planning with sea level rise management and local coastal hazard mitigation planning efforts increases the efficiency of both planning and outreach efforts. This coordination also results in the development of comprehensive products that are multidimensional and more effective in habitat and resource protection. References Johnson, Z. 2000.

These include increased growth, conversion of land to development, and a variety of point and nonpoint source pollution problems. Because of the wide range of issues facing the State and the cumulative nature of their effects, it is important to use a comprehensive approach in addressing these issues. Maryland's waterways already show signs of degradation from cumulative and secondary impacts. These can be seen in high nutrient loads, loss of habitat and excess sedimentation. In 1998, the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan identified 43 watersheds within the coastal zone in need of priority restoration (see Maryland Section 309 Assessment). In addition, 21 watersheds were identified to be in need of protection and preservation. There was some overlap between the two categories. It is expected that between 1990 and 2020 population in Maryland will increase by 28 percent, with much of this increase falling within the coastal zone. A watershed approach will enable the State to look holistically at the wide range of issues effecting its land and waterways. The Department of Natural Resources has begun partnering with local communities and other agencies to develop local Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS). The WRAS Program is a multiyear, multi-program approach to integrated watershed protection and restoration. The goal of WRAS are to comprehensively design and implement water quality and habitat improvement activities on a local watershed scale. This is accomplished by providing local governments with the financial and technical assistance necessary to develop and implement the strategies. Components of the planning process include watershed characterization, stream corridor assessment, public participation, goal setting and action plan development. The Maryland WRAS Program builds upon the 1998 Federal Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP), which proposed an expanded collaborative effort by state, federal, and local governments, the private sector, and the public to address all aspects of watershed health. The WRAS Program incorporates Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan goals, including: restoration of watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals, and sustaining healthy conditions in watersheds currently meeting those goals. Maryland has several initiatives that support and/or require a ""holistic"" watershed approach to looking at issues such as stream buffers, land use, growth, and habitat. The watershed restoration action strategies are an opportunity to combine and coordinate these multiple programs and projects. Increased coordination will strengthen the networked nature of Maryland's CZM Program. A list of state initiatives that have incorporated a watershed approach is attached (Attachment B). These major efforts are all vital components of Maryland's coastal environmental restoration and 10   protection strategy. Clearly, these efforts are closely related, many have similar goals and approaches, and can be implemented in a coordinated manner that will strengthen all of the related programs. Closer integration of watershed planning will help achieve more cost-effective pollution control and habitat restoration efforts, for example, by coordinating various program requirements and time lines for a single water body and selecting the most effective implementation mechanisms. Additionally, linking watershed efforts will increase stakeholder confidence and certainty. Proposed Program Changes / Implementation Plan The WRAS will serve as agreements between local governments, the Maryland CZM Program and appropriate state agencies. These strategies will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities. Specific program changes can be found at both the state and local level. These are described in greater detail below: This Section 309 strategy will provide for the adoption of program changes at the local level. Local governments are required to meet state guidelines regarding growth and planning. As local governments lead efforts to create watershed strategies, outcomes could include: incorporation of strategy elements into local comprehensive plans; adoption of local implementing tools, such as zoning ordinances and environmental codes; modification to sensitive areas elements; and alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. The WRAS Program reinvents Maryland's program delivery process and includes partnerships with other state agencies. Currently, this coordination includes the review of watershed characterizations, sharing of relevant information and data, and cooperation on specific topics of concern. In the future, this partnership could be increased to support prioritization of some technical and financial assistance based on the availability of a watershed strategy. The WRAS initiative will be included in the updating of Memorandum of Understanding between networked CZM agencies. Anticipated Effects of Change This effort will lead to the development of approximately 18 Watershed Restoration Action Strategies, with three started in FFY2000 (See Assessment for details), for priority watersheds located within Maryland's coastal zone boundary. Using public participation, these plans will take a comprehensive look at the watersheds and result in a defined implementation plan for each one. Anticipated improvements include:  A comprehensive strategy to improve the watershed: The final product in this initiative is a comprehensive goal that when implemented will improve watershed health and water quality. This can include reduction in nonpoint source pollution and sedimentation, increased buffer habitat, improved water quality, preservation of land, and improved aquatic systems.  Effective delivery of DNR services: DNR technical services, including GIS-based conservation and restoration targeting, field analysis, habitat restoration, monitoring and funding, 11          are currently delivered on a site by site basis. The WRAS initiative enables the Department to target these resources to priority areas where watershed plans are in development or completed. Innovative management projects: Implementing watershed plans require creative approaches to managing pollution and preserving resources. This initiative promotes demonstration projects that can be applied in other watersheds. Increased coordination and partnerships: The WRAS initiative demands cooperation at both a local and state level. This partnership can include technical knowledge, financial assistance, planning expertise, and implementation. Increased capacity: By working with state agencies and other partners, local governments are increasing their capacity to do watershed planning. Marketing Tool: The final watershed strategy can serve as a marketing tool to leverage funds and technical assistance.  The long-term goal is to have the WRAS serve as a template for improving coastal land and water resources throughout the coastal zone. Not only will the strategies improve coordination and program focus, there will be resource improvements as the strategies are implemented. Appropriateness of Program Change Cumulative and secondary impacts were identified as a high priority in the Maryland Section 309 Assessment. In the past, Maryland's Section 309 efforts under this enhancement area have focused on strengthening the sensitive elements associated with local government comprehensive plans. With the identification of priority watersheds and scientific recognition of a comprehensive watershed management, the state recognized the need to take a watershed-based approach to restoring and protecting its resources. A WRAS is largely an intergovernmental plan of work which identifies the most important causes of water pollution and resource degradation, details actions needed to address these problems, and sets milestones by which to measure progress. It coordinates and improves existing programs and planning capacities based on the assessment of natural resource conditions and scientific monitoring data -increasing capacity to address environmental problems at a watershed level, and strengthening existing organizations charged with assessment, planning, and implementation. WRAS are also designed to address the limitations of traditional planning and restoration approaches, including: (1) potential for independent projects to duplicate or undermine other projects at various levels of government or citizen activity; (2) lost opportunities to deliver integrated financial, technical, public participation and other services; and (3) need for state or federal restoration and preservation projects to obtain local buy-in and sponsorship to address communities' real priority environmental challenges. Experience has shown that a key to making this locally-based program a success is DNR's provision of financial and technical resources to local governments in exchange for local sponsorship of watershed 12   strategy development, and assumption by local authorities among others of the responsibility for its implementation. By providing local governments with funding to develop their watershed planning efforts, Maryland is promoting the watershed approach while getting local buy-in to the process. This is critical to a successful initiative. Finally, as the lead partners, local governments have a great interest in ensuring that the final strategies are implemented. During strategy development, local stakeholders will focus on areas of concern to them. Implementation will be done on the local level with the appropriate financial and technical support from state agencies. This implementation could include additions to local comprehensive plans, modification in planning and zoning, or specific restoration efforts. In order to promote this approach, It is anticipated that as efforts move forward the CZM Program will include WRAS as a component in their revised MOUs between networked state agencies. Fiscal and Technical Needs A key to watershed planning is an accurate assessment of the resources and issues. Not all data is available at a watershed scale and specific monitoring and surveying would provide valuable information for decision making. Data needs could include water quality monitoring, stream surveys, or fish and benthic data collection. As appropriate, these assessments should be completed prior to finalizing the watershed strategy. In addition, it is important to monitor the success of strategy implementation. There is also a great need for the sharing of technical information. The Department has technical expertise and information that is key to developing an accurate characterization and watershed strategy. Relevant state data include land use maps, environmental indicators, sensitive areas and green infrastructure. In addition, the State has technical expertise not available in all counties, including geographical information systems (GIS), restoration planning, and mitigation banking planning. The WRAS Program will be the means for providing this critical state-level information to localities in an integrated fashion. Budget Task Strategic Planning - Local Government Data Collection, Analysis and Demonstration Projects Strategy Implementation Total Work Plan 13 FY 2001 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2002 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2003 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2004 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2005 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000   Strategic Planning - Local Government: The strategy proposed will span five years. However, WRAS pilot projects are underway in three counties using FY2000 funds. The WRAS framework includes an eighteen-month watershed management planning process for each watershed, followed by local implementation of priority actions. The WRAS development process includes:  bringing together stakeholders;  characterizing the watershed;  conducting stream corridor assessment surveys;  identifying and prioritizing of issues of concern;  developing environmental management goals and actions;  creating a financial plan; and  developing a strategy to monitor effectiveness of the WRAS. An interim product is the Watershed Characterization Report, which includes the assessment of the current condition of the watershed and establishment of baseline data including, for example:  areas of population growth;  sensitive coastal resources;  impacts (threats) to resources;  regulatory and planning programs that can be used to address impacts;  trends in the health of the watershed; and  application of restoration targeting tools to identify potential restoration and protection opportunities. Based on the findings of this report and additional information, a public outreach and visioning process is conducted in each locality to define problems, and set goals and objectives. Implementation priorities, for restoration and protection projects, as well as funding mechanisms, roles, responsibilities, and time frames are established. Data Collection, Analysis and Demonstration Projects: Funding under this component will focus on meeting information needs for strategy development and supporting innovative analysis tools and management techniques that can be applied in multiple watersheds. Data collection and monitoring would be focused on needs identified by the selected WRAS counties. An example would be a stream corridor assessment where trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk (or paddle) an entire watershed, documenting stream corridor or shoreline problems and restoration opportunities, rate them as to accessibility, severity, and correctibility. A database and report of the findings would then be used in strategy development. Demonstration projects would be funded based on innovativeness and need. These projects would not necessarily fall in watersheds selected for complete WRAS development, but could be in areas identified as priority 1 (in need of restoration) or priority 3 (in need of preservation) by the Clean Water Action Plan. This enables other counties (e.g. with watershed plans in place and more pristine 14   watersheds) to demonstrate and share lessons they have learned and the challenges they have addressed. The key component of these projects would be the ability to share the information with other local governments. Strategy Implementation: Finally, some Section 309 funds would be reserved for implementation priorities identified in the final WRAS. These implementation projects will focus on achieving coastal resource protection and enhancement, incorporation of coastal resource protection policies into local master plans and ordinances, and improved coordination among agencies responsible for land use programs, water quality, and habitat protection. Likelihood of Success The WRAS process is an excellent opportunity to foster the State CZM Program's transition to a more holistic, comprehensive, watershed-based approach. Such deep programmatic change is a necessary step toward greater local investment and empowerment with regard to the unique natural resources and environmental heritage that distinguish and shape local communities. It is also important in the implementation of new Clean Water Act TMDLs. The degree of support for this type of strategy is strong in Maryland. The Department of Natural Resources, in conjunction with a number of federal and state agencies, has committed to implement watershed management planning. As mentioned earlier, other ongoing initiatives that support strategy development include Tributary Strategies, Chesapeake Bay Program, the Coastal Bays National Estuary Program, Total Maximum Daily Loads, and Smart Growth legislation. This strategy builds on the coordination at all levels of government, and allows stakeholders to be involved in the planning, design and implementation of strategies for the regions in which they live. Upon completion of the strategies a key to success will be implementation. Efforts are underway to ensure that funding and technical expertise are available to see the strategies through to fruition. Only a small portion of implementation funds would funnel through CZM Section 309. The majority would come from other programs including Clean Water Act Section 319 which provides nonpoint source pollution control funds. To aid county's in finding appropriate funding sources, a part of the WRAS initiative is the development and distribution of a financial assistance guide. In summary, this strategy proposes building on support for a watershed planning approach to address the cumulative impacts of development on coastal resources. The strategy will continue momentum among the public, interest groups and governmental agencies who strive to bring about both program changes to Maryland's Coastal Management Program, as well as changes in land-use decision-making at all levels of government to protect Maryland's coastal resources.  15"

Two Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the WRAS project area are State-identified priorities for restoration: Bush River and Bynum Run. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 119,600 acres including about 10,845 acres of open water. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the County to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Five of the six Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin are identified in the State's 303(d) list for not supporting their designated use. The causes appear to be related to four general categories of water quality problems: 1) nutrients in tidal waters and lakes, 2) suspended sediment in both tidal and nontidal waters, 3) toxics substances found near Aberdeen Proving Ground, and; 4) biological limitations identified in specific nontidal stream segments. As one step toward remedying these problems, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) projects will be conducted over the next several years. TMDLs for nitrogen and phosphorus have been established for Swan Creek. During the years 1985 to 2000, one long term monitoring station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River shows trends for two parameters -- long term measurements for both total phosphorus and algae abundance suggest a worsening of conditions. All other long term water quality measurements at this station show no significant trend (total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and water clarity as measured by secchi disk). Land Use Land in the Bush River Basin has significant concentrations of development. Overall, the River Basin is about 35% developed. The most developed 8-digit watershed is Bynum Run (53% developed) and the least developed is Bush River (nearly 25%). Agriculture is a significant land use across the Bush River Basin except for Aberdeen Proving Ground. Agricultural land use involved 16 to 40% of the land in the other 8-digit watersheds. Overall, forest land covers more than one third of the Bush River Basin. Large concentrations of forest are found in the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Bush River watersheds. Relatively little remains in the Bynum Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds (about 23 and 28% respectively). Wetlands cover large acreage of Aberdeen Proving Ground (about 16%) and significant acreage in the Bush River 8-digit watershed (over 7%). Compared to other Bush River Basin watersheds, Bynum Run watershed has the highest percent developed land and greatest extent of land identified for Smart Growth in a Priority Funding Area. It also has the least protected land and forest interior. viii Sept. 2002   Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Chesapeake Bay is considered to be very important for fish spawning and nursery. Estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the overall productivity of the area but specific information on Bush River Basin fisheries is not available. In nontidal streams, about half of the fish populations assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) were rated as good and most of remainder were rated fair or poor. MBSS sites rated as very poor were all within the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed. Fish consumption advisories have been issued for two tidal fish species (channel catfish and white perch) due to PCBs and pesticides and for some species commonly taken from lakes due to methyl-mercury. In nontidal streams, benthic populations assessed by the MBSS across the Bush River Basin were commonly rated fair or poor. Locations assessed by MBSS as good were all found in the Swan Creek watershed. In the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, most areas assessed were rated as very poor. Sensitive species areas identified for project review purposes are found in all of the 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin. However, Wetlands of Special State Concern, which are subject to regulatory review requirements for sensitive species, are concentrated in a few areas: Bush River Watershed (Otter Point Creek, North of Sod Run, Church Creek), Atkisson Reservoir, and Swan Creek watershed (Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area, Swan Harbor Farm Park). Habitat for the Federally Endangered Maryland Darter is located in the Swan Creek watershed (Gashey's Run). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations in the Bush River are very sparse compared to the potential physical habitat. The factors inhibiting SAV locally are believed to be associated with poor light penetration, elevated algal populations, nutrients and suspended solids. Restoration Targeting Tools Otter Point Creek in the Bush River watershed is designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve. This designation provides for protection of over 900 acres of water, wetlands and uplands. The designation has also fostered long term efforts for estuarine research, monitoring and education relating to the local estuary. DNR conducted a stream corridor assessment on Church Creek in 2002. This information augments earlier work by DNR on Bynum Run and Swan Creek and by Harford County in other Bush River Basin watesheds. These surveys identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion and other measures of stream condition. This information provides a ground-truthed foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. For example, one GIS scenario suggests that opportunities for stream buffer restoration targeted to areas of poorly drained hydric soils to maximize nutrient uptake may be found upstream of Bel Air and in several headwater streams in the Bush River watershed.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Harford County Director of Department of Public Works Department of Public Works, Water Resources Engineering Department of Public Works, Water and Sewer Department of Planning and Zoning Department of Parks and Recreation Health Department Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Coastal Zone Management Division Watershed Restoration Division Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Fisheries Service Resource Assessment Service Upper Western Shore Tributary Team Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army Environmental Center Maryland Department of Agriculture Maryland Department of the Environment Maryland Department of Planning  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Department of the Natural Resources  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Harford County is one of five Counties participating in the second round of the WRAS program.

Swan Creek is not part of the County's WRAS project area included to allow comparison of subwatersheds across the entire Bush River Basin.  Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information 1 Sept. 2002    identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2  Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) was applied to three subwatersheds in the Bush River basin as shown in Map 4 Category 1 Priority Watersheds: - Bush River, watershed 02130701 - Bynum Run, watershed 02130704 - Swan Creek, watershed 02130706 (outside of the WRAS project area) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization.  Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 5 Designated Uses shows the distribution of designated uses across the Bush River Basin. In the simplified summary below, designated uses requiring the better water quality are listed first and the least restrictive (Use I) is listed last. In general, Use I water quality requirements apply everywhere unless superceded by criteria necessary for other designated uses. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 3 - Use III Natural Trout Waters: Bynum Run and all tributaries - Use IV-P Recreational Trout Waters and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries - Use II Shellfish Harvesting: All estuarine portions of tributaries except: (a) Bush River and tributaries above a line from Fairview Pt. to Chillbury Pt. (b) Romney Creek above Briar Point (c) Swan Creek and tributaries above mouth - Use I-P Water Contact Recreation, Protection of Aquatic Life and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries, including Atkisson Reservoir from Otter Point Creek to upstream boundary of Atkisson Reservoir. - Use I Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All water bodies not otherwise designated above. 3 Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings The table 303(d) List of Impaired Waters shows that there are 13 listings within the Bush River Basin. These listings mean that pollution associated with nutrients, suspended sediment and/or toxic materials are preventing full use of these waters based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal for a WRAS could be elimination of 303(d) listings for the watershed and/or mitigation of the causes contributing to the listings. Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions As shown in Map 5 Designated Uses, a large portion of the Bush River are designated for shellfish harvesting. However, the entire area shown as Use II waters for shellfish harvesting on the map is ""restricted."" This restriction applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" Use II (shellfish harvesting waters in this basin are technically restricted because only minimal monitoring is being done due to the lack of a commercially harvestable resource.26 There are relatively few oysters in the Bush River because it typically has less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity but oysters grow best in water with greater than 12 ppt. Consequently, the State's shellfish area monitoring efforts are not invested in low salinity areas like the Bush River where oysters can not be commercially harvested. In the absence of regular monitoring, the restriction is necessary to protect human health because oysters and clams are filter feeders that are readily contaminated by even brief or intermittent exposure to animal and human waste.  4  Sept. 2002   303(d) List of Impaired Waters for the Bush River Basin4 from 2000 Maryland Section 305(b)Water Quality Report, Appendix F Watershed Bush River: Cranberry Run & Broad Run Bush River Number 02130701 -1129 02130701 Impairment Biological Sources Unknown Priority low  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  NPS, natural NPS, natural  low low  Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run  02130702 02130703  impairment not listed Nutrients Suspended Sediment NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural low low low low 18 low low low low low  02130704  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  Aberdeen Proving Ground  02130705  Toxic Substances Nutrients Suspended Sediment Toxic Substances  Swan Creek  02130706  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  5  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 work load projections, MDE has set several target years for establishing TMDLs for water bodies in the Bush River watershed. (Note 1: work load scheduling is subject to change.

Biological. Within selected stream segments, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Toxic Substances. A wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous or lethal affects or otherwise harm aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. A few examples are heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts.  8  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, three watersheds in the Bush River Basin watershed were listed for action under the highest priority for restoration (Category 1 Priority):  Bush River 02130701  Bynum Run 02130704  Swan Creek 02130706 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment used water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 watersheds which were applied to help characterize the Bush River Basin. The findings for the water quality indicators are summarized in the table below and are more thoroughly explained in the following text. Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  State 303(d) List Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Modeled TP Load Tidal Habitat Index Tidal Eutrophication Index  2 27.88 1.14 4.3 7.0  0 11.54 0.38  2 9.18 0.49  2 10.94 0.47  2 9.32 0.32  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  9  Swan Creek 2 15.28 0.67 Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Water Quality Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. State 303(d) Impairment In the Bush River Basin, all of the watersheds in the Basin are on the 303(d) list with the exception of Lower Winters Run. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the following watersheds have one or more water quality problems that need correction or restoration: Bush River, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek. 2. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load For the Bush River Basin, the total nitrogen (TN) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for Atkisson Reservoir and Aberdeen Proving Ground watersheds. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. All the other watersheds in the river basin has relatively high estimated total nitrogen loads reaching the Chesapeake Bay. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TN to the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient reaches streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much nitrogen, so higher TN loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Four watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek) exceeded this benchmark. 3. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load For the Bush River Basin, the total phosphorus (TP) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for four watersheds: Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Aberdeen Proving Ground. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. The TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from two Bush River Basin watersheds was estimated to be relatively high according to the computer model. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TP to the Chesapeake Bay. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much phosphorus, so higher TP loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. 10 Sept. 2002   To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds did exceeded this benchmark. 4. Tidal Habitat Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Habitat Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having poorer tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: algae populations as measured by surface chlorophyll a, water clarity as measured by secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""4.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed exceeded this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Eutrophication Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""7.0"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  Water Quality Background 1950s to 1988 Slow flushing characteristics of the Bush River tend to accentuate water quality problems there. It typically takes 48 days for this tidal fresh estuary to flush.8 Salinity in the tidal Bush River varies from about 5 parts per thousand (ppt) at the Chesapeake Bay to about 0.1 ppt in the upper Bush River to less than 0.05 ppt at the mouths of tributary creeks like Otter Point Creek.14 11 Sept. 2002   1. Tidal Bush River The earliest available water quality records covering the 1950s through 1965 noted high bacteria levels in the tidal Bush River. This a period before public sewerage services were offered in the Bush River watershed. The sources of this bacterial problem were believed to be existing discharges directly into the river including Bata Shoe, Edgewood Arsenal and probably effluent from private septic systems. Sampling in 1965 verified high bacterial populations in the river including E. Coli. These high bacterial populations were found in extensive areas of the upper tidal reaches of the Bush River and along the western shore of the Bush River toward the Chesapeake Bay. 11 1970s and 1980s In General Bacteria problems began to cause swimming closures in the Upper Bush River beginning in 1971. These problems were in-part associated with failing septic systems.8 Several projects gathered water quality data in the 1970s and 1980s: 1972 Goucher College Environmental Studies Program had sampling stations in the open tidal waters of the Bush River and near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 1977 DNR had sampling stations in the tidal waters of the Bush River.9 1980-82 CH2M Hill, a consultant working for Harford County had most sampling stations in open tidal waters of the Bush River with the exception of two stations near the tidal interface in Otter Point Creek and James Run. 9 1987 Harford County Dept. Of Public Works10 1988 Harford Community College12 Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations measured at all stations by CH2M Hill and DNR were higher than the minimum standard of 5.0 mg/l. However, 1972 dissolved oxygen sampling data showed several DO standard violations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 In 1987, DO concentrations below the standard were recorded at Church Creek, the upper Bush River and Otter Point Creek.10 Additional DO problems were reported in 1988 for Greys Run, Cranberry Run and Bynum Run.12 High fecal coliform bacteria populations were found by DNR in July 1977 up and down the tidal Bush River. 1982 monitoring by CH2M Hill found the highest fecal coliform bacteria populations and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) tended to be from their two stream stations. The next highest findings were found near Otter Point.9 Specific sources of these problems were believed to be associated with remaining failing septic systems even though about one-half of the watershed's population was now served by public sewer service.8 1987 sampling found four sites with fecal coliform bacteria greater than 200 MPN (most probable number): 2 stations in the upper Bush River, Winters Run at Rt 40 and James Run at Rt 40. Additionally, Bynum Run and Church Run were considered likely contributors.10 Winters Run was identified again for a high fecal coliform count in 1988.12 Algae blooms reported in the upper tidal Bush River were believed to be driven by nutrient inputs from tributary streams.9 In 1987, algae blooms in the upper Bush River north of the AMTRAK railway bridge was identified as a continuing issue. Nutrient concentrations in the tidal Bush River were high. For total phosphorus, concentrations 12 Sept. 2002   greater than 0.01 mg/l were considered to highly enriched. Monitoring in 1972-73 for DNR Power Plant Siting found total phosphorus concentrations were nearly always greater than this benchmark with peak concentrations between 0.05 and 0.07 mg/l. 19 1987 monitoring data found that the orthophosphorus fraction alone averaged between 0.04 and 0.08 mg/l. 10 For total inorganic nitrogen (which is collectively ammonia, nitrite and nitrate), concentrations greater than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/l were considered very high. 1972-73 data gathered for the DNR Power Plant Siting Program found organic nitrogen concentrations occasionally above 0.5 mg/l.19 Monitoring data found that ammonia nitrogen ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 mg/l and nitrate nitrogen ranged from 0.02 to 0.77 mg/l. Data for the two streams sampled supported the belief that tributary streams were a significant nutrient source for the Bush River. Additionally, 1972 data collected by the Goucher College Environmental Studies Program reported high nutrient concentrations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. In 1987, high nutrient concentrations tended to found at all sampling sites.10 In 1988, elevated nutrients were found at all sampling sites including Bynum Run, James Run, Greys Run and Cranberry Run. Additionally, a trend toward increasing nitrate concentrations was reported.12 Sedimentation problems were believed to be associated with urbanizing areas of the watershed.9 High sediment loads were reported in Lower Winters Run. 8 The County Dept. of Public Works identified several streams as the major sources of sediment to the upper Bush River in 1987: Otter Point Creek, James Run/Bynum Run, and Church Creek. Then, again in 1988, turbidity levels exceeding the State standard were reported for Bynum Run (the highest), Winters Run and James Run. 2. Atkisson Reservoir13 During the 1970s, excessive sediment movement in streams above the Reservoir was known to be a problem based on water intake records maintained by Maryland Water Works. Sampling in 1980 in the 38-year old Atkisson Reservoir found that 81% of its original volume had been lost to deposited sediment. That same year, stream surveys conducted upstream of the Reservoir found excessive sediment in Winters Run and Plum Tree Run near the Reservoir. However, turbidity in the reservoir in 1980 was not found to be a problem. [These findings may suggest that sediment mobilized upstream of the Reservoir tended to be larger particles that readily settled out in slack water, ed.] The Reservoir was characterized as eutrophic with algae blooms commonly occurring in summer. The blooms were believed to be caused by high total phosphorus concentrations in the Reservoir ranging from 0.07 to 0.52 mg/l. At the time, EPA criteria was 0.025 mg/l total phosphorus. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations were identified in deep waters of the Reservoir below the 13 foot depth. Bacterial problems in the Reservoir were identified in the 1960s and 1970s. Sampling in 1980 verified that fecal coliform counts were typically high. Temperature, pH, metals or pesticides were not identified as concerns in the Reservoir.  13  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment 1989 to the Present In the Bush River Basin (021307), there is one regularly scheduled long-term water quality monitoring effort for one station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River. All other monitoring is short term and special purpose. For example, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey collects water quality information in nontidal streams as part of its program. Additionally, MDE collected water quality data in 1999 to support permitting decisions and anticipated work on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).26 Cheseapeake Bay Program Tributary Monitoring Station WT1.1 shown on Map 6 Monitoring Stations is the best source of long term water quality data for the tidal Bush River. DNR Resource Assessment Service has analyzed data from this station and a summary of their findings appears in the table below. The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, the ranking of ""fair"", which is the most common ranking in the table, means that the Bush River ranking is fair compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. Additional discussion follows the table in this section. A more detailed look at the historic water quality record for this monitoring station is presented in Appendix A Selected Water Quality Historic Record for Bush River Station WT1.1. As part of DNR's work of the Upper Western Shore Tributary Team, this relative water quality assessment for the tidal Bush River and nearby tidal tributaries is presented in DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html. 1, 9 For additional information on water quality in general and Station WT1.1 specifically, see http://www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm and www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1998 -2000 data Fair Fair Poor Good Poor Fair Trend 1985 through 2000 No Trend Degrading (46%) Degrading (117%) No Trend No Trend No Trend  14  Sept. 2002   1. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total nitrogen concentrations varied slightly more than 1 mg/l averaging 1.2 mg/l for the year.

Phosphorus Total phosphorus concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing concentrations suggesting worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total phosphorus concentrations varied about than 0.1 mg/l averaging 0.074 mg/l for the year.

Algae Abundance of algae as measured by chlorophyl a Chlorophyll A concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 50 Bush River suggested ""poor"" 40 water quality. For the period 30 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing 20 concentrations suggesting 10 worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total 0 nitrogen concentrations varied Months January Through December more than 40 ug/l averaging about 25 micrograms per liter (ug/l). The year 2001 average chlorophyll a concentrations suggest that algae abundance is typically high enough to inhibit health of submerged aquatic vegetation during the growing season. MG/l  4. Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen Dissolved Oxygen concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 12 Bush River suggested ""good"" water 11 quality. For the period 1985 10 through 2000, there was no trend 9 toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows dissolved 8 oxygen concentrations varied about 7 5 mg/l averaging 9.2 mg/l for the 6 year. Measurements at this station Months January Through December have consistently met the State water quality standard of 5.0 mg/l during the past several years. Data collected from this station, due to its location in the middle of the Bush River's open tidal waters, probably does not reflect dissolved oxygen conditions in tidal waters in more restricted areas.

Water Clarity The measurement of water clarity for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 at station WT1.1 in the 0.6 Bush River using secchi disk depth suggested ""poor"" water 0.5 quality. For the period 1985 0.4 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. 0.3 During 2001, the graph shows secchi disk depth varied less 0.2 than one half meter averaging Months January Through December 0.4 meters for the year. Measurements from this station indicate that water clarity is too limited to support submerged aquatic vegetation. However, water clarity conditions in other parts of the tidal Bush River may differ significantly. MG/l  Secchi Disk Depth  6. Suspended Solids Total suspended solids concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality.

Chemical Contaminants Overall, the Bush River is identified by the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as an area with insufficient or inconclusive data.30 Sampling of sediment and the water column in the Bush River has not been conducted to support a more definitive statement. However, limited data in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed has identified toxic substances of concern in small areas. Additionally, the most recent Fish Consumption Advisory from the Maryland Dept. of the Environment identified PCBs, pesticides and methyl mercury in fish tissue as concerns.  MG/l  17  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. Permit information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Bush River basin is summarized in the table below and on Map 7 MDE Permits. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant The the Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) began operating in 1969 with a discharge to Romney Creek. By the late 1970s, the plant had expanded capacity from 4 million gallons per day (MGD) to 10 MGD. In October 1982, the discharge averaging about 5 MGD was moved to the Bush River in response to tightened discharge requirements for Romney Creek.9 In the Bush River watershed (02130701), the discharge from the Sod Run WWTP is the most important nutrient point source. For the year October 2000 to October 2001, the average effluent flow from the plant was 11 million gallons per day. The monthly average total phosphorus concentration for the period was 1.1 mg/l. For the same period, The monthly average total nitrogen concentration was 9.0 mg/l.27  21  Sept. 2002   MDE Permits Listing  Page 4 of 5 (Sept. 2001 data) Lower Winters Run Watershed 02130702 Atkisson Reservoir Watershed 02130703 Type / MDE Category Surface Water / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Facility Name Tollgate Landfill Permit(s) MD/NPDES 96DP2887 MD0065765 95DP1318 96DP2890 97SW1247 97SW0539 00MM2282 00HT9423 MDG679423 95MM9708 MDG499708 00HT9510 MDG679510 Winters Run Edgewood Osburn Lane, Joppa Winters Run Lake Vista Drive, Joppa Old Mountain Rd, Joppa Winters Run Bel Air Road Receiving Stream / Location Winters Run North Tollgate Road, Bel Air Norrisville Rd, Jarrettsville Bel Air Rd, Bel Air  Jarrettsville Elementary Village Volvo Alcore, Inc.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on several sources:  Listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  Modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization.  The Maryland Biological Stream Survey identified evidence of nonpoint source problems including erosion in the riparian area, streambank erosion and sedimentation. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Bush River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Bush River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations.  Urban stormwater management  Lawn maintenance issues  Potential stream maintenance projects 1. Erosion and Sedimentation Some Soils in the Bush River basin are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  Sedimentation Research Findings From Otter Point Creek The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the relation between sediment deposition and local marshes. A brief summary of recently completed research is included below. Sediment deposition from upstream areas created river delta areas of Otter Point Creek. The physical dynamics of this tidal freshwater delta area have been extensively quantified and modeled.14 Research on the historic conditions indicate that pre-settlement sedimentation rates were about half of rates from later times when agriculture covered 40 to 50% of the watershed. The long term sediment accumulation rate in Otter Point Creek was as high as 5 cm-yr during the 1840 to 1900 period. This rate is comparable to other delta areas in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. 14 Recent sedimentation cycle study found that marsh areas are growing due to sediment accumulation and incorporation into the marsh matrix.15 Study of marsh areas that were previously sewage lagoons at Otter Point Creek indicates that they tend to act as nitrogen sinks.16 This action is similar to that of other marshes and suggests that these areas act to improve water quality in their vicinity. 24 Sept. 2002   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Historic records show that very large areas of land on the Bush River's western shore appeared since the arrival of the Europeans.8 This new land includes most of the Edgewood Area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the southern shores of Otter Point Creek. It may be inferred that formation of this land was caused by extremely high erosion and sedimentation rates associated with the land clearing and management of the past 300 years. Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 25 Harford County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 30 2 - 4 feet / year 11 > 4 feet / year 5  140  46(33%)  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Maps produced for Harford County in 1995 included digitized shorelines. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Updates of these maps should be available by the end of 2002.  25  Sept. 2002   Water Supply In the Bush River Basin, there are eight providers for community water supply systems. The majority use groundwater as their source water but two have surface sources as shown on Map 8 Water Supply. Information for the surface water systems are summarized in the table below. The community systems served by groundwater in the Bush River Basin are summarized in the table Groundwater Community Water Supply Permits. The groundwater sources serving these systems are mostly unconfined aquifers with the exception of the Potomac Group Aquifer which is tapped by the Harford County Dept. of Public Works. Well head protection areas have been established for the wells operated by Harford County and the City of Aberdeen as shown on the map.23 The groundwater sources used for community systems in the Bush River Basin do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. In general, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land sources to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal or objective for a WRAS could be augmentation of existing programs to protect community water systems by targeting projects or controls in watersheds above surface water intakes.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which a watershed like those in the Bush River Basin can be compared with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. The following sections identify the findings for the watersheds in the Bush River Basin, with the exception of the population density indicator, which is based on 2000 Census data not available when the Unified Assessment was done.

Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark.

Impervious Surface Based on estimates of imperious cover for each 8-digit watershed in the Bush River Basin averaged across each watershed, the percent of impervious surface cover varies from about 10% to over 30%. These findings for average imperviousness do not compare well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the Bush River watersheds exceeded this benchmark. 2. Population Density According to 2000 Census data, the population density in the watersheds in the Bush River Basin varied from less than one person per acre in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to more than three people per acre in the Bynum Run watershed. The figures in the table differ from those that appeared in the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment . A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  29  Sept. 2002   3. Historical Wetland Loss The estimated historic loss of wetlands in watersheds in the Bush River Basin varies from a relatively very small 258 acres in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to over 9700 acres in the Bush River watershed. This range of estimated wetland loss in Bush River Basin watersheds is relatively small compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not found to be in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams According to data used for the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment , only the Bynum Run watershed in the Bush River Basin had a relatively high percentage of unbuffered streams compared to other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bynum Run watershed exceed the benchmark because it was in the highest quartile. The other watersheds in the Bush River basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not in the highest quartile.  30  Sept. 2002   5. Soil Erodibility For four of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Swan Creek), the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is greater than 0.30 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important in these watersheds.2 For the Bush River watershed and the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is 0.18 and 0.01 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  31  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart summarize the Year 2000 land use for the Bush River Basin. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Just under 37% of the Bush River Basin is forest. This is up from the estimated 20% forest cover in the same area at the beginning of the 20th Century, which was the peak of deforestation in the area.14  Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use, 6-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (23.30%) Urban (34.74%)  Wetlands (4.92%) Other (0.45%)  Forest (36.59%)  2000 Land Use / Land Cover Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area in Acres (Md Dept. of Planning) Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 5,350 5,481 5,117 99 84 16,131 16,862 Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Agriculture Forest and Brush Urban Wetlands Other Land & Land Water Only Watershed Total  7,318 17,395 9,169 2,683 402 36,967 45,837  1,370 3,406 3,444 163 16 8,399 8,468  11,488 7,569 9,913 28 23 29,021 29,076  3,345 3,413 7,780 0 39 14,577 14,583  219 8,426 7,959 3,176 0 19,780 21,625  29,090 45,690 43,382 6,149 564 124,875 136,451  32  Sept. 2002  Total   Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use  8-Digit Watershed Pie Charts  Bush River 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (19.80%)  Lower Winters Run 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (16.31%) Urban (41.00%)  Urban (24.80%)  Wetlands (7.26%) Other (1.09%) Forest (47.06%) Wetlands (1.94%) Other (0.19%) Forest (40.55%)  Atkisson Reservoir 8-Digit Watershed  Bynum Run 8-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (22.95%)  Urban (34.16%)  Agriculture (39.59%) Urban (53.37%)  Wetlands (0.10%) Other (0.08%) Forest (26.08%)  Forest (23.41%) Other (0.27%) Wetlands (0.00%)  Aberdeen PG 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (1.11%)  Swan Creek 8-Digit Watershed  Urban (31.72%)  Agriculture (33.17%)  Urban (40.24%)  Forest (42.60%) Wetlands (0.61%) Other (0.52%)  Wetlands (16.06%)  Other (0.00%)  Forest (33.98%)  33  Sept. 2002   Large Forest Blocks / Forest Interior Large blocks of forest land cover are incorporated into the Green Infrastructure of the landscape. Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they can not tolerate much human presence. Map 10 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away). This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. While blocks of forest interior cover about 22% of the entire Bush River Basin, the amount of large-block forest interior varies significantly among the 8-digit watersheds in the river basin as summarized in the table below:  About one third of the two watersheds abutting the Chesapeake Bay (Bush River and Aberdeen PG) are covered by large blocks of forest interior.  Bynum Run watershed has the least forest interior cover relative to other Bush River watersheds.  The three remaining 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin have similar amounts of forest interior cover (between 14% and 18%).

In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs and the existing or potential connections between them are called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 11 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  Bush River Basin Green Infrastructure hubs tend to be located in lowlands near the Chesapeake Bay in two 8-digit watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground. These hubs appear to exist because of the protection from development pressure afforded by Federal ownership/management. Another large hub is located in the northern central portion of the Bush River watershed.  Lower Winters Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds have small Green Infrastructure hubs adjacent to major streams.  Bynum Run watershed has a small portion of a Green Infrastructure hub near its confluence with the Bush River. All other areas of natural vegetation in the watershed did not meet Green Infrastructure criteria (generally too small in size).  Swan Creek watershed has several Green Infrastructure hubs that are separated by the major highways serving the Baltimore / Philadelphia areas. Potential Next Steps. Green Infrastructure, Forest Interior Dwelling Species and other views of the landscape could be integrated into various local landuse planning and management scenarios.  35  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement and other mechanisms. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The table Protected Lands Summary and Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Bush River basin.  In the Bush River Basin, Federal land ownership accounts for nearly one third of the land. Federal Land dominates land ownership in two watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground.  Non-Federal land protection in the Lower Winters Run watershed is the highest percentage (9%) among watersheds (8-digit) in the Bush River Basin. This relatively high percentage of protection is mostly associated with the Otter Point Creek Park. This property has been designated as a component of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maryland. A total of 261 acres of open water and 672 acres of adjoining wetlands and uplands are protected for long-term estuarine research and monitoring and for estuarine education. 4 Potential Next Steps. Existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors or hubs for WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Watershed location should be a factor in considering land protection opportunities.  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects.  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  36  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary * Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area Protected in Acres Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 247 0 136 0 0 719 2% 7% Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Conservation Easements DNR Land County Parks Agricultural Easements Agricultural Districts Federal Land Percent of Watershed Protected  435 530 132 359 189 13,390 4% 41%  362 0 62 312 0 0 9% 9%  15 0 804 710 361 0 5% 7%  73 70 30 0 35 0 1% 1%  0 0 0 0 0 19,795 0% 100%  33,904 3% 31%  The percent on top excludes agricultural districts and Federal land.

In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Harford County's Rural Legacy Area is located entirely outside of the Bush River Basin, which is mostly in the Deer Creek watershed. - Priority Funding Areas (PFA) in Harford County are mostly in the Bush River Basin with relatively small areas of PFA located in other County watershed areas. The table below shows the relative PFA area for the Bush River watersheds. Priority Funding Areas (PFA) Summary Bush River Basin Watershed PFA Acres Name Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen PG Swan Creek Bush River Basin Total Acres 36,967 8,399 29,021 14,577 19,780 16,131 124,875 12,834 5,160 5,860 12,066 2,016 3,965 41,901 Percent of Watershed In PFA 35% 64% 20% 83% 10% 25% 34%  Note: Data is from 2000. Acreage in PFAs and protected land acreage are not mutually exclusive. It is common for park land, which is commonly considered to be protected, to be in a PFA to facilitate receiving State funding for park infrastructure. For example, Otter Creek Park is protected from development but it is entirely within a PFA. Therefore, protected land acreage and percentage of a watershed should only be used as an indicator of general direction for development.  38  Sept. 2002   Soils of the Bush River Basin 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor Natural Soil Groups for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil Bush River Basin conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Harford County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using (27.21%) (29.91%) Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. The pie chart shows the distribution of percentages of soils based on broad categories: (16.14%) -- Yellow - prime agricultural soils (26.74%) -- Green - all other well drained soils including stony/rocky soils -- Blue - all poorly drained soils including wetlands and marshes and soils with perched watertables. -- White - unclassified soils including all of Aberdeen Proving Ground The Map 13 Soils shows that prime farmland, depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching, is widely distributed across the Bush River Basin. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Using Prime Farmland as an example, the scattered location of prime agricultural soils in the Bush River Basin suggests that agricultural preservation efforts need to be targeted to selected areas and prioritized for action to help ensure that protection efforts result in viable agricultural communities. Additionally, prioritization of agricultural cost share funding to these areas could provide additional incentive for local land owners to participate in agricultural preservation programs. Comparing Map 13 Soils with Map 9 2000 Land Use and Map 11 Green Infrastructure suggests other potential watershed planning approaches. For example, two Green Infrastructure hubs are located north of the tidal Bush River along upper James Run and Grays Run. In these areas, land owners tended to leave poor soils in natural vegetation because the soils were wet or stony. Targeting natural resource protection efforts to areas like this, which offer poor suitability for active use, could benefit both land owners and natural resource protection.  39  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26  The Bush River Basin has a great diversity of wetland types relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because it includes both Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic areas and it has both tidal and nontidal freshwater waterbodies. Map 14 Wetlands In The Bush River Basin shows the general distribution of wetlands based on the National Wetlands Inventory. The majority of the wetland acreage in the river basin is on Federal land Brief descriptions of the major wetland categories found in the River Basin are listed below. Estuarine Wetlands. These systems consist of brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where freshwater runoff from the land receives some saltwater influence. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Bush River Basin's Coastal Plain covering nearly 5,700 acres. Brackish marshes are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay and they are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These systems are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In the Bush River Basin, this wetland type covers slightly more than 3,700 acres. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant but are represented in the Bush River Basin. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) Lacustrine wetlands (associated with lakes) and Riverine wetlands (associated with rivers) cover relatively small areas of the Bush River river basin: 54 acres and 21 acres respectively. 2. Wetland Studies In the Bush River Basin The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of plant populations in local marshes. During the 1990s, a plant list for Otter Point Creek compiled by William Hilgartner identified 133 species of herbaceous plants and 39 species of woody plants.17  40  Sept. 2002   3. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have amounted to a small net increase in nontidal wetland acreage in the Bush River watershed. Research findings from Otter Point Creek associated with the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the changes over time in local marshes. According to research reported in 1998, the mix of wetland types in the upper Otter Point Creek tidal freshwater marshes has changed greatly since early colonial times. In about 1730, nearly the entire marsh area here was subtidal, i.e. the marsh was mostly underwater. By 1990, the same marsh area had changed so that its area was roughly one third subtidal, one third intertidal and one third forested.14 The change appears to be associated with sediment deposition and incorporation into the marsh.15 Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Bush River Basin In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 20 Basin Code 02130701 02130702 02130703 02130704 02130705 02130706 021307 Watershed Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen Proving Ground Swan Creek Permanent Impacts -8.01 -3.43 -3.55 -8.37 -0.13 -5.27 Permittee Mitigation 10.19 8.47 9.03 6.15 0 7.85 Programmatic Gains 0 0 0 0 0 2.20 Other Gains 0.76 0 0 0 0 0 Net 2.94 5.05 5.48 -2.22 -0.13 4.78  Bush River -28.75 41.71 2.20 0.76 15.91 Basin Notes: Only nontidal wetland changes are shown, tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented for each watershed is not normalized. Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998.  41  Sept. 2002   4. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Bush River Watershed (02130701) are shown in Map 15 Wetlands On NonFederal Land: Bush River Watershed. The table below accompanies the map with a summary of wetland categories and acreage. Based on the DNR wetlands data used for the map, forested fresh water wetlands are the largest category of wetlands in this area. The data source used for this interpretation has not been completed for the entire Bush River Basin. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)

However, coverage for the Bush River Basin (021307) is incomplete. The National Wetlands Inventory is available for the entire Bush River Basin but it has a lower resolution and, therefore, identifies a smaller wetland acreage for the same geographic area. In comparison, the generalized land use / land cover data presented earlier in this chapter is the lowest resolution data that identifies wetlands and, therefore, identifies even fewer wetlands in the same geographic area. See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion on Wetlands of Special State Concern.  42  Sept. 2002   Floodplains and Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Floodplains and associated riparian areas are naturally important areas for habitat and hydrologic functioning of streams. Map 16 Floodplain shows that the most 100-year floodplains in the Bush River Basin are located on Federal land. On non-Federal land, two of the largest 100-year floodplain areas are on lower Winters Run and near the confluence of Bynum Run and James Run. Most floodplain areas are too small to be seen at the basin-wide scale and require subwatershed scale or smaller assessment. Most areas of the Bush River Basin have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Marylandwide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report. According to this report, all the at-risk areas identified in the Bush River Basin are on Federally managed land.24 Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions and other stakeholders as it becomes available. Potential Next Steps. Protection of people and property has always been the core of floodplain management. Additional objectives for watershed management relative to floodplains may include conservation of habitat, targeting for restoration of wetlands and stream buffers, and prioritization for protecting selected areas from development or inappropriate uses. Using information gathered in the Stream Corridor Assessment, restoring natural floodplain and wetland function can be one criteria for prioritizing stream restoration projects. Maintaining stable floodplains on a watershed-wide basis can be a factor in determining stormwater management requirements including control of impervious area in a watershed.  43  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Bush River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time or resources. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats and other factors should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  44  Sept. 2002   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality and habitat. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Bush River Basin.2 In the table below, ""attain"" means watershed conditions are at least as good as the benchmark. ""Exceed"" means that watershed conditions are not as good as the benchmark. An empty box in the table """", means that an indicator could not be generated. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS.  Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Requirement Attainment Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  1.0 2.0 ----  ------  --4.4 8.50 5.98  ---8.30 6.01  ------  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  45  Swan Creek ---- Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Living Resource Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""2.0"" for the Habitat Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 The Coastal Plain stream benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment , reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average benthic IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir watershed's ranking of less than 6.0 caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"" for this index.  46  Sept. 2002   4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 As interest in whole ecosystems, and ecosystem health, has grown, Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured-- numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition). To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average fish IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds both had higher index ranks higher than 6.0. 5. Nontidal In-stream Habitat Index 21 In the Bush River Basin two watersheds had sufficient data for assessment in the nontidal instream habitat index. Both the Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds received a score of 6 out of a possible range of scores from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""exceed"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value and other factors. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  47  Sept. 2002   Fish and Shellfish 1. Tidal Waters The Bush River is an important spawning and nursery ground for many fish species.19 A survey conducted during the period March 1972 to June 1973 found that the Bush River has considerable spawning by several anadromous, semi-anadromous and local species. These included the commercially important species of striped bass, white perch and herring. It found a wide range of types of fish inhabiting the area. However, two species were clearly dominant in numbers: white perch were said to be ubiquitous and anchovy were found seasonally. 19 Commercial fisheries harvest information is tracked by Maryland DNR Fisheries Service. This information is available on DNR's Internet site. The Bush River's data is reported for several important commercial species as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay geographic area (above Worton Point). Reporting for other commercially harvested species is not summarized here because reports are for even larger geographic areas.  Blue Crabs: Commercial harvest reporting for blue crabs groups Bush River data with the Upper Chesapeake Bay above Worton Point. For this wider area, commercial blue crab harvest for the 1992 to 1999 was significantly higher than in previous years. Since 1992, the annual harvest tended to be greater that 1 million pounds with a significantly higher peak in 1995 of 2,266,000 pounds.  Oysters: There is no commercial oyster harvest in the Bush River because the regulatory shellfish harvesting restrictions prevent oyster harvest. Even so, the commercial harvest in the entire Upper Chesapeake Bay is a minuscule percentage of the Bay-wide harvest. The very low salinity of the area inhibits oyster habitat and survival.  Striped Bass: The reported annual harvest for striped bass in 1999 from the Bush River was 5,583 pounds. Prior to 1999, Bush River data was reported as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay (north of Worton Point). During the late 1990s, the annual harvest for the Upper Bay including the Bush River was typically around 70,000 pounds with one exception in 1998 with a larger harvest of 97,000 pounds. The Chesapeake Bay's most important striped bass spawning and nursey area is considered to be the Upper Chesapeake Bay based on area size and productivity. The estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the productivity of this area but the relative value of the Bush River is not well understood. 2. Nontidal Areas General information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See MBSS Findings for summary information. The Designated Use of Bynum Run as Use 3 Natural Trout Waters suggests that brook trout where found here. However, DNR Fisheries Service has no records that naturally reproducing trout populations exist anywhere in the Bush River Basin.28 48 Sept. 2002   3. Fish Consumption In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories including significant limitations on consumption of some fish species in the Bush River area. The advisory recommends not eating channel catfish and severely limiting meals of white perch caught in the Bush River mainstem. The concern in these fish is contamination from PCBs and/or pesticides. Methylmercury is also a contaminate of concern primarily for some fish species caught in lakes. The table below summarizes advisory for areas in the Bush River Basin. More complete information is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html In issuing the 2001 advisory, MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to advisories to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing.

The survey found nothing peculiar, special or unusual regarding the phytoplankton community. Of the six most common species found, five were diatoms and one was a bluegreen algae. As an indicator of the extent of green algae populations, chlorophyll a concentrations only occasionally reached high levels above 50 ug/l. The highest chlorophyll a concentration reported during the study was 139 ug/l.19  Maryland Biological Stream Survey  21, 22  Assessment of biological communities in nontidal streams, like macroinvertebrates, fish and their physical habitat can help with interpretation of aquatic conditions from the perspective of living resources. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) has been conducting these assessments Statewide since 1994. More recently, beginning in the year 2000, MBSS has also facilitated collection of benthic macroinvertebrate information by citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program. The MBSS approach involves assessment of each site using a suite of criteria including identification of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate species present. The findings from the criteria are then combined to generate an index for benthic organisms, fish and for physical habitat. The table below shows the scales used to rate findings for the sites shown on the accompanying maps and the table MBSS Findings Summary for the period 1994 through 2000. Additional explanation of the purpose and value of assessing benthic organisms is presented in the text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams . More complete information on the MBSS program and findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Map 17 Benthic Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 18 Fish Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 19 Physical Habitat Index Scale of 0 to 100 0 to 11.99 12 to 41.99 42 to 71.99 72 to 100  Category Very Poor Poor Fair Good  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the fish/benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has conditions that are close to those found in a comparable 50 Sept. 2002   ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poor deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. Additional monitoring by MBSS is scheduled for the Bush River Basin to assess the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.)10 Sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program is anticipated to continue during this time. Potential Next Steps. MBSS provides site-specific information on nontidal streams that can be considered in the WRAS process to prioritize potential restoration and protection projects. Additionally, for selected streams or project areas, before and after monitoring using MBSS methods can provide a gauge of success for individual projects. MBSS methods can also provide a measure of progress toward water quality improvement goals based on biological indicators.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae, to invertebrates like crayfish and insects, to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish and similar creatures. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  52  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Bush River Basin. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  53  Sept. 2002   2. Wetlands of Special State Concern The Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) in the Bush River Basin are shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species though most are difficult to see at the scale of the map. The largest groupings of the WSSCs are listed in the summary table below. Wetlands of Special State Concern  Areas of Concentration In The Bush River Basin Watershed Name Bush River Watershed 02130701 Acres 28 Stream Vicinity Otter Point Creek North of Sod Run Church Creek Atkisson Reservoir 02130703 Swan Creek 02130706 Bush River Basin 021307 37 44 109 Atkisson Reservoir Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area Community Vicinity Flying Point Road / Willoughby Woods area South of Perryman Road, ""Perryman Woods"" area North of Rt 40, ""Church Creek Pond"" Harford Glen Center and Aberdeen PG property Oakington Road, Swan Harbor Farm Park  3. Maryland Darter In the Swan Creek watershed (02130706), Gashey's Run was declared critical habitat for the Federally endangered Maryland darter by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. This designation, in part, means that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reviews activities that meet two conditions 1) a federal permit, license and/or funding in involved, and; 2) there is a potential to impact the species or its habitat.26  54  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Bush River Basin  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 26 SSPRAs are identified in the Bush River Basin. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 20 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Bush River basin (Md 6-digit wateshed). NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) There are three concentrations of WSSCs designated in the WRAS project area and several are designated elsewhere in the Bush River Basin. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  55  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance makes SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. In addition to its value as a water quality indicator, SAV is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 21 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation shows that during the 1980s and 1990s distribution of SAV in the Bush River basin is generally very sparse. Within the WRAS project area, all the SAV areas that were large enough to identify using aerial photography were located adjacent to Federal land. Elsewhere in the Bush River Basin, the largest concentration of SAV has been near Swan Creek. Experience obtained through years of monitoring SAV demonstrates that acreage in the Bush River fluctuates from year to year. For example, SAV acreage in Bush River during the year 2000 was at least 17% and 12 acres greater than acreage in 1999.29 The map also shows that potential SAV habitat area based on a water depth of two meters or less. This shallow depth covers extensive areas of the Bush River and the perimeter of the Bush River Basin adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. It is believed that the limitations exhibited by historic SAV distribution compared to potential habitat relate in part to excessive nutrient and suspended sediment loads in the Bush River and the Upper Chesapeake Bay. The nutrient loads appear to be driving algae growth that competes with SAV for sunlight. Additionally, suspended sediment also blocks the sunlight which reduces the light that reaches SAV leaves. Potential Next Steps. Beginning in early 2002, Harford County and numerous Federal and State agencies began cooperating to pool their information on SAV and to generate a consensus on SAV management for the Bush River. The findings and results of this effort can be integrated into the local watershed management strategy. The Anita C. Leight Estuary Center and Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) will begin a long term research and restoration project to restore native SAV species to Otter Point Creek and surrounding waters. The staff are using innovative ""SAV planting grids"" and will be using multiple species of SAV to determine the most suitable species, or combination of species, for restoration to the site.

In partnership with Harford County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment on Church Creek in the Bush River watershed in 2002. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  Potential Next Steps. Harford County has demonstrated success in using Stream Corridor Assessments to identify restoration projects. For the WRAS, this information can be used as a foundation to prioritize/target geographic areas for restoration and/or types of projects for implementation in a watershed-based management strategy.  Recent Stream Corridor Assessments Harford has completed several Stream Corridor Assessments in the Bush River Basin including Bynum Run (1995-1996), Swan Creek (Spring 1994 - Spring 1995) and Winters Run (1998). Each report identifies each site where problems are identified and ranks its severity relative to other sites. Each report also singles out specific sites that are considered particularly severe. As an example of this work, the table below summarizes the findings from the Bynum Run effort.7  57  Sept. 2002   Bynum Run Stream Corridor Assessment Findings Matrix for Winter 1995-1996 Potential Problems Identified Count Length Est. feet / miles 86,818 / 16.4 Severity Frequency 1 23 24 45 62,954 / 11.9 12,554 / 2.4 14 15 1 6 2 3,100 / 0.6 2 132 2 50 8 26 22 3 5 5 1 -120 3 82 33 35 47 20 9 6 4 2 238 4 49 43 22 22 19 2 1 2 -160 5 11 64 15 13 14 7 5 1 5 135  Erosion (stream banks) Pipe Outfalls Fish Blockages Inadequate Buffers, Unshaded Streams Channel Alternation Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping Livestock TOTAL  214 172 143 118 71 24 23 10 9 784  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Based on 2002 sampling in the Bush River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Bush River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  58  Sept. 2002   Aricultural Conservation Programs Harford County has a high level of participation in agricultural conservation programs. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Harford Soil Conservation District (HSCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Harford SCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Potential Next Steps. Encouraging implementation of BMPs, nutrient management, participation in conservation programs and other agricultural approaches to protecting water quality are important elements in local water management strategy that can be augmented through the WRAS process.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the five marinas in the Bush River offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 22 Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  59  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Bush River Basin appears in the Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities Table and Map 23 Fish Blockages. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for Stream Corridor Assessments that have been completed or are planned. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. Of the more than twenty fish blockages listed in the database, one on Lower Winters Run known as Van Bibber Dam was mitigated in 1990. Correction of this blockage reconnected a large segment of Lower Winters Run to the Chesapeake Bay. Potential Next Steps. In general, mitigation or removal of a blockage to fish movement is recommended if the change would open a significant stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. DNR Fisheries Service can provide technical advice and potentially funding for mitigation projects. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of lakes, farm ponds or drainage ditches. If a blockage is found in any of these categories, circumstances like requirements for public recreation needs, drainage control function, land owner needs and other factors are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  60  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 1 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Bush River 02130701 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  BU010 BU011 BU012 BU013 BU014  Gray's Run James Run James Unnamed Tributary Unnamed Tributary yes Otter Point Creek Lower Winters Run Lower Winters Run Winters Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run  Carsins Run Road 0.25 miles above I-95 James Run Road Gulf Road 0.3 miles below Rt. 159 0.1 miles above Edgewood 50ft below Atkisson Dam 0.2 miles above Singer Road 25 yards above Rt 1 1 mile below Wheel Road 1 mile above Wheel Road 0.8 miles above Wheel Road 0.5 miles below St. Andrews Rd. 0.1 mile below St. Andrews Rd. 0.6 miles below Rt. 1 0.7 miles below Rt 23 Rt 23  Lower Winters Run 02130702 Atkisson Res. 02130703 Bynum Run 02130704  BU016 BU017 BU018 BU019 BU001 BU002 BU003 BU004 BU005 BU006 BU007 BU008  Aberdeen PG 02130705  no blockages listed in database  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  61  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 2 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Swan Creek 02130706 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  CW010 CW011 CW030 CW031 CW032 CW063 CW064  Gashey's Creek Gashey's Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek  0.2 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road 0.1 mile above Rt. 40 100 ft. above Oak St. 130 yards above Oak Street 0.33 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  62  Sept. 2002   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps.  63  Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. Restoration of stream buffers is a valuable agricultural Best Management Practice Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates (BMP). By identifying land uses By Land Use in riparian areas with inadequate Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) stream buffers, like crop land Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment adjacent to streams, the potential (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) to reduce nutrient and sediment loads can be improved. To Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 assist in finding areas with crop Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 land adjacent to streams, the same land use data shown in Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover can be filtered using GIS. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 The new scenario shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 64 Sept. 2002   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Bush River Basin, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the central part of the Bush River Basin. The map suggests that several areas north of Bel Air have unbuffered streams on hydric soils. This type of area could offer opportunities to restore stream buffers and intercept nitrogen in near-surface groundwater before it reached the nearby stream. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of current field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. 65 Sept. 2002   In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Bush River Basin, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in tidal portions of the Bush River arise from multiple tributary streams and tidal exchange with the Chesapeake Bay, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in tidal waters. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, and providing erosion control and sediment trapping. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, dredging or filling has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Bush River and Bynum Run 8-digit watersheds, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (mostly agricultural fields or bare ground) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. 66 Sept. 2002   Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are numerous concentrations of hydric soils that are near existing wetlands. These areas could be candidates for wetland restoration. The areas identified on the map along Lower Winters Run near the existing protected land at Otter Point could offer both restoration and natural resource protection opportunities within an existing management program.  In comparing Map 26 with Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land , several areas appear in both the stream buffer and the wetland restoration scenarios. For example, the headwaters area of Broad Run, James Run and Grays Run may be candidates for restoration projects that could meet multiple natural resource and water quality protection objectives. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership and other factors. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  67  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is not currently funding projects in the Bush River Basin.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. 2002 SAV Experiment In Otter Point Creek Three species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) have been transplanted from grow out stations at the Anita C. Leight Estuary Center to prescribed areas of Otter Point Creek to test habitat suitability. This project was conducted by Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) staff along with volunteers as part of the Reserves' research function. 2. Anita C. Leight Estuary Center 2002 Access Improvement The Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve partnered with DNR Program Open Space, Harford County Parks and Recreation and the Harford Land Trust to purchase property near the Anita C. Leight Park which is in the Otter Point Component of the Reserve. Subject to necessary approvals and permits, improvements will include replacement an existing unsafe pier with an ADA accessible pier, addition of an ADA path from the parking area to the pier, and a parking lot upgrade to create a safe ADA parking. The new area will be used for public canoe and pontoon boat programs and as a monitoring site.  68  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Bush River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 69 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criteria #3 Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  70  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES  1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

The number is often used alone as either a noun or an adjective to refer to some aspect of that section of the law, such as grants. Maryland has divided the state into 138 watersheds, each comprising an average of about 75 square miles, that are known as 8-digit watersheds because there are 8 numbers in the identification number each has been given. These nest into the 21 larger 6-digit watersheds in Maryland which are also called Tributary Basins or River Basins. Within the Chesapeake Bay drainage, 8-digit watersheds also nest into 10 Tributary Team Basins. Fish that live most of their lives in salt water but migrate upstream into fresh water to spawn.

Each graph shows two lines: one showing the average measurment for each month and one showing the standard deviation. The example below suggests how to interpret the graphs. Abbreviation key for the graphs: AVG - Average measurement for each month based on the historic record. STD - Standard Deviation for each month based on the historic record.  Total Phosphorus (TP) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is slightly less than 0.10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is 0.025 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.075 mg/l and 0.125 mg/l - This range for total phosphorous indicates fair water quality.  Total Nitrogen (TN) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is about 1.2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is close to 0.5 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.7 mg/l and 1.7 mg/l - This range for total nitrogen indicates fair water quality.  106  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 2 of 4  107  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 3 of 4  108  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 4 of 4  109  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B Maryland Biological Stream Survey 2000-2004 Volume 1 Ecological Assessment of Watersheds Sampled in 2000 Prepared for Maryland Department of Natural Resources Prepared by Nancy E.

GX036-23-11470055	"Statement of Jane Nishida, Maryland Department of the Environment  Presentation Before the Senate Environment Committee  Regarding the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" - A Maryland Perspective  May 13, 1999       Opening Remarks   Good Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Sub-Committee. My name is Jane Nishida, Secretary of Maryland's Department of the Environment I am delighted to be here today to support the President's new national initiative to protect America's rivers, lakes, and coastal waters and to give a Maryland perspective on behalf of Governor Parris Glendening. After 27 years of pursuing regulatory solutions under the existing Clean Water Act, the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" represents a fresh and innovative approach which greatly enhances the environmental of options available to States to address impaired waters.   Maryland is very fortunate to have one of the nations most outstanding resources--""the beautiful Chesapeake Bay"". The people of Maryland know the importance of the Chesapeake Bay and are committed to continue the excellent progress we are making restoring the health of the Bay. There are many waters around the country which could similarly benefit from a comprehensive watershed management approach, like the watershed assessment, restoration prioritization process, and action strategies which are promoted through the ""Clean Water Action Plan"".    The New Direction   The Nation's clean water program has been reinvigorated through the ""Clean Plater Action Plan"". This process refocuses State efforts through strengthening and expanding existing programs to assure protection of public health, enhancing stewardship of natal resources, strengthening run-off standards, and expanding citizen's right to know.   Maryland is very excited about these new opportunities. The Action Plan will provide Marylanders a process for refocusing priorities and a mechanism for developing an over-arching strategy to address issues which transcend various environmental laws such as, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act.    The Bay Program - As a Model   No better model exists as to how a watershed approach can serve as a catalyst for developing interrelated voluntary and regulatory solutions to water quality management, than the ""Chesapeake Bay Program"". Through the Bay program strong federal, State, and local partnerships were achieved. Tributary Teams made up of citizens, local governments, environmentalists, scientists/engineers, homebuilders, and various business and economic interests were established. Waters were assessed, problems identified, and goals agreed to. One of the most successful outcomes was voluntary efforts to achieve a 40 percent nutrient reduction goal. Each Tributary Strategy Team identified reductions targeted to both point and nonpoint sources in each watershed.   Maryland in cooperation with local governments instituted a 50/50 cost share program supported by the Maryland General Assembly which has contributed over $125,000,000 over the past ten years to the cost for insuring nitrogen removal equipment at 63 targeted sewage treatment plants. As effort alone has been credited for reducing nutrients to the Bay by 27 percent.   Governor Parris Glendening and the Maryland General Assembly also passed landmark legislation, through the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998, which will require nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plans on all farms by 2002 and complete implementation by 2005.   Various stakeholder groups in Maryland are currently working with the Department of the Environment to pursue nutrient removal requirements for septic systems to provide for a balanced approach in addressing nutrient reductions from all sectors.   The ""Clean Water Action Plan"" will strongly reinforce Maryland's efforts to clean up the Bay through various initiatives to include:   Promoting watershed assessments, providing guidance for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), and enhancing current funding levels for State programs through funding programs like Section 106 and 319.   Establishing nutrient water quality criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus and provide the scientific basis for State adopted standards.   Requiring all State's to manage nutrients on farms by implementing the new Federal Unified Animal Feeding Operation Strategy which will create level playing field among farmers, on a national level, balancing nutrient removal between point and nonpoint sources, and most importantly ensuring that waters impaired by agricultural run-off are restored.    Public Health as a Vital Element of the Action Plan   Although the Bay program has focused on traditions pollutants like suspended solids, oxygen demanding substances, nutrients, fecal coliform and toxics, the summer of 1997 Maryland also demonstrated the need to devote equal attention to public health issues like Pfiesteria.   Emerging disease issues like Pfiesteria and the outbreak of Cryptosporidium in Milwaukee several years ago reinforces the need to reinvigorate our public health program. Source protection studies under the Safe Drinking Water Act and river basin studies under the Clean Water Act, can achieve far greater results by combining them under a collaborative watershed assessment approach as encouraged under the ""Clean Water Action Plan"".   It is essential that EPA and States place appropriate emphasis on finding new mechanisms for treatment and new barriers to disease transmission which replace inadequate historical approaches to protect against this new generation of diseases. Chlorination alone cannot be the answer. Watershed assessments, source water protection, and comprehensive performance evaluations at water plants must be viewed collectively as new approaches to public health protection.    Gunpowder Watershed Project -- A Prototype   In Maryland, such a comprehensive watershed assessment is underway for the Gunpowder Watershed Project. In 1997, EPA, Maryland, Baltimore County, Carroll County, and Baltimore City forged a new partnership to look at issues impacting Baltimore Cites metropolitan area reservoir, Loch Raven. The project examines both the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act issues and investigates:    Impacts from sewage treatment plants on stream biodiversity, health and extent of fisheries, and reservoir eutrophication.   Stormwater impacts on nutrient loadings and localized stream back erosion.   Sedimentation rates of the reservoir.   Cryptosporidium occurrence in the reservoir.   Source protection benefits as compared to water treatment costs, and   Land use impacts associated with development on overall shears loadings and impairments.   As the assessment is completed and various options are considered and prioritized many of the remedies promoted by the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" will be considered. These will necessarily include options for:   Creating wetlands   Using monitoring results to develop TMDLs and watershed permits   Instituting the CAFO Strategy on farms   Implementing Phase II stormwater management requirements   Encouraging pollution prevention and pretreatment requirements at industries and a variety of other options to assure protection of wildlife, improve aquatic habitat, and to enhance natural resources.    Smart Growth   Another approach encouraged Trough the ""Clean Water Action Plan'', which Maryland is  aggressively pursuing involves Smart Growth. Governor Glendening introduced and the Maryland General Assembly passed landmark legislation in 1997 which discourages sprawl development by targeting public funds to existing community centers where infrastructure is in place to accommodate ""planned growth"". This program protects and preserves ""green areas""' eliminates new sources of pollutant run-off, enhances existing communities, and promotes a better quality of life for all Marylanders.   Not only does the Smart Growth initiative discourage sprawl and promote ""green areas"" but it targets limited public funding to existing infrastructure needs which significantly enhances efforts to reduce pollution from metropolitan areas. Key projects receiving targeted funds include combined sewer overflows, stormwater retrofits, Brownfields, sewage treatment upgrades, water supply source protection and treatment, wetland creation projects, and small creek and estuary restoration projects.    Summary and Recommendations   Maryland is looking forward to developing restoration strategies like the Gunpowder project  for other watersheds identified as put of the State's watershed assessment process. Only through collaborative efforts involving multi-media solutions, strong federal/State/local partnerships, and enhancement of existing programs and implementation mechanism, can State efforts continue the progress towards restoring impaired waters to fishable/swimmable standards. The ""Clean Water Action Plan"" is a formidable and well-conceived mechanism for assuring that national water management goals are achieved.   Much progress has been made under the framework of the Clean Water Act but, as we move  forward to the next millennium, new challenges must be met with renewed focus and commitment. Watershed assessments and permits nutrient water quality standards, a progressive CSO Strategy, implementation of the AFO/CAFO Strategy, new wetlands initiatives, stricter controls on non-point source run-off, and Smart Growth will all be essential elements in our new environmental management approach.   Maryland strongly supports the watershed restoration and assessment approach as well as  balanced tributary strategies which are desired to achieve water quality goals through a continuation of voluntary and legally mandated programs. Merging objectives and bringing efforts together to comprehensively address public heals, water quality and living resources is what is needed and what U.S. citizens and Marylanders expect us to do to meet the continuing challenges of restoring and preserving fishable/swimmable waters.     "

The WRAS project area encompasses about 162,000 acres which is 72% of the entire Upper Choptank River watershed. Portions of the watershed in Delaware and Queen Annes County, Maryland, are being considered in the WRAS project but these jurisdictions are not active partners in developing the WRAS. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the Counties to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Overall, water quality as measured by some parameters like dissolved oxygen is frequently satisfactory. However, water quality impairments associated with nutrients and sediment have existed for many years. They appear to be causing high algae populations (chlorophyll a) and poor water clarity (shallow secchi depth). The nutrient impairment is linked to significant loads from both point and nonpoint sources. A fecal coliform impairment in limited areas do not have a currently identified source. These impairments will be the subject of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) programs within the next few years. Biological impairments in some water bodies as measured by benthic macroinvertebrate community assessment appear to be local in nature. Land Use / Land Cover The Upper Choptank River watershed in Maryland is nearly 60% agricultural and nearly 30% forest or brush. Only about 8% of the watershed is developed. Land use / land cover upstream of the WRAS project area in Delaware are less intensively used: 50% agriculture, 45% forest, 3% developed. Large areas of agricultural and developed lands are on hydric soil and/or poorly drained soil which is drained by Public Drainage Association ditches. Maintenance of these ditches is central to continuation of much of the current economic activity in the watershed. Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Choptank River contains a valuable fisheries resource. It ranks as the third most important striped bass spawning and nursery area in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in terms of size and productivity. In the Upper Choptank, most fish species appear to be stable or doing well. For example, a survey of tidal large mouth bass found the population to be stable or slowly increasing over the three-year study period 1999 through 2001. However, a fish consumption advisory recommends limiting consumption of channel catfish and white perch caught in the mainstem of the Choptank River due to PCB and/or pesticide contamination. viii Sept. 2002   Assessment nontidal streams based on benthic macroinvertebrate communities found that more than 60% of the sites assessed rated as poor or very poor. Assessment of the same stream segments based on fish communities rated more than 60% of the sites as good or fair. These differences indicate that fish, in general, can inhabit maintained ditches more readily than benthic organisms. Beds of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Upper Choptank River are small and limited to narrow areas along the river's shoreline. SAV is limited by poor water clarity in much of it potential habitat. Restoration Targeting Tools A synopic survey and benthic community assessment of nontidal streams is collecting data was conducted in 2002. It will assist is identifying areas with issues regarding water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates. A stream corridor assessment is being considered that would identify conditions that potentially impact waters quality and habitat using teams walking along waterways. Four blockages to fish movement have been eliminated in recent years but at least 21 blockages are identified as opportunities for restoration. GIS scenarios were generated to assist in targeting opportunities for restoring stream buffers and wetlands. Hydric soils were used as a key targeting element as well as land use. Based on this analysis of the Upper Choptank River watershed in Maryland, there are over 26,500 acres of wetlands and nearly 43,000 acres of hydric soils. Nearly 24,000 acres of hydric soils were being used as cropland in 2000. This suggests that many opportunities for restoration may be available depending upon land owner interests. A subset of these potential opportunities, about 7,300 acres of hydric soils are within 300 feet of existing wetlands.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Local Representatives Raymond Clarke Betsey Krempasky Shane Johnston Matt Kropp Talbot County Dept. of Public Works Caroline County Planning and Code Administration Caroline County Planning and Code Administration Talbot County Dept. of Planning and Zoning  Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Katharine Dowell, Kathleen Freeman, Greta Guzman, Susan Phelps-Larcher, Catherine Rappe, Ted Weber, John Wolf Fisheries Service Harley Speir, Rick Schaefer, Brett Coakley, Chris Judy, Jim Thompson Public Lands John Dulaney Resource Assessment Service (RAS) Ron Klauda, Sherm Garrison, Martin Hurd, Thomas Parham, Renee Karrh Maryland Maryland Maryland U.S. Fish Dept. of Agriculture (MDA) - John Roderick, Bonita Sims Department of the Environment (MDE) - Robert Daniel, Patrick Dinicola Department of Planning (MDP) - Deborah Weller & Wildlife Service (USFWS)  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Maryland Department of the Natural Resources  Other Representatives  Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR)  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) established a program to offer funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Talbot and Caroline Counties are participating in the second round of the WRAS program. The portions of the Upper Choptank Watershed in these Counties are the area selected for restoration. This watershed has several key physical characteristics: - The Upper Choptank is entirely in the Mid Atlantic coastal of Maryland's Eastern Shore; - The watershed is predominantly rural and agricultural with significant forest, small towns and pockets of suburban development; - Open waters of the Upper Choptank mainstem exhibit limited tidal influence. They receive fresh water input from numerous sluggish tributaries including many that are ditched. Location Upper Choptank Watershed Acreage Summary  The Upper Choptank watershed is part of the Choptank Area Land Water Total River basin as shown in Map 1 Talbot County 36,397 1,607 38,004 Regional Context.

These two counties are Watershed Total 219,984 4,740 224,724 the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy which is shown in Map 3 WRAS Project Area. For analytical purposes, DNR has divided the Upper Choptank into 44 subwatersheds as shown in Map 4A, Map 4B, and Map 4C. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives: 1 Sept. 2002        briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues provide preliminary findings based on this information identify sources for more information or analysis suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work.  Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization provides a foundation for developing strategies that can be implemented over time to improve water quality. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity of existing programs and policies  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management."" 2 Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Upper Choptank River watershed was included in two categories for priority action: - Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) - Category 3 watershed (indicates that protection us needed for identified resources) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization. Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. These designated uses may or may not be served now but they should be attainable. All surface waters in the Upper Choptank River watershed are designated Use I for Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Aquatic Life. Waters designated as Use II for Shellfish Harvesting in the Choptank River are located in estuarine waters downstream of the Upper Choptank River watershed. Map 5 Designated Uses shows that Use I water encompass the entire Upper Choptank watershed. For official regulatory information, please see either COMAR or contact MDE. 3,4  3  Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings Some Upper Choptank River watershed water bodies are identified as ""impaired waters"" by listings in the Draft Maryland's 2002 303(d) List summarized below. Satisfactory completion of a public comment period and approval by US EPA is required before the list can be finalized later in 2002. Each water body listed in the table may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4 Draft 2002 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Upper Choptank River Watershed Summary Name Stream or Watershed Choptank Marine Beach Upper Choptank Watershed Upper Choptank Watershed Stream segments in Talbot County: Beaverdam Branch and unnamed tributaries to Miles Creek Stream segments in Caroline County: Burrsville Br., Coolspring Br., Gravelly Br., Oldtown Br., Tidy Island Ck & an unnamed tributary to it, and unnamed tributaries to each of Andover Branch, Choptank River, Forge Branch and Herring Run These listings mean that pollution associated with the impairment listed are preventing full use of these water bodies based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Impairment Fecal coliform bacteria Nutrients Sediments Biological Sources Nonpoint sources Point, Nonpoint, Natural Point, Nonpoint, Natural Unknown  4  Priority high low low low  4  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 modeling load projections, 2006 is MDE's target year for establishing a fecal coliform TMDL to protect the Choptank Marine Beach. The January 2002 modeling load projection did not include a schedule for nutrient or sediment TMDLs for the Upper Choptank River. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Existing conditions for pollutant loads (pounds per day) and pollutant sources. 2- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept and while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 3- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load (#2 above) to specific pollutant sources. To ensure that TMDLs are not exceeded, programs developed by the State and local governments need to be implemented to address pollutant reduction.  5  Sept. 2002   Why Are Local Waters Impaired? Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land uses and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the working condition and location of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from manmade sources such as the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment conveyed to a stream varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Fecal Coliforms . One class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warmblooded animals, including humans, is known as fecal coliforms. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, water samples commonly contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by fecal material. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources.  6  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  7  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The 1998 Clean Water Action Plan Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Upper Choptank River watershed was included in one category for priority action: highest priority for restoration.2 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The findings for the water quality indicators are explained in the following text. 1. State 303(d) Impairment Number The Upper Choptank River watershed appeared in the 303(d) list for three impairments, which means that the impairments need to be corrected. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the watershed needs restoration. 2. Nontidal Total Phosphorus Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed was among those with a lower total phosphorus (TP) concentration based on data from ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring stations in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total phosphorus among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Upper Choptank River watershed was ranked ""9"" for TP. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TP scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 3. Nontidal Total Nitrogen Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed was among those with a lower total nitrogen (TN) concentration based on data from ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring stations in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total phosphorus among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Upper Choptank River watershed was ranked ""8"" for TN. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TN scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  8  Sept. 2002   4. Tidal Habitat Index Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those having better tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: surface chlorophyll a, secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked ""6.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked ""5.9"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 6. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those transporting less total nitrogen (TN) to the Chesapeake Bay. The modeled TN load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from the Upper Choptank River was 9.21 lbs/acre. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay.. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 7. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those transporting excessive loading of total phosphorus (TP) to the Chesapeake Bay. The modeled TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from the Upper Choptank 9 Sept. 2002   River was 0.75 lbs/acre. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark which included theUpper Choptank River watershed.  Tributary Team Characterization As part of the work of the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Upper Choptank water quality was characterized several parameters at two monitoring sites that are listed below. 1, 9 The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, poor means that the Upper Choptank River ranking is poor compared to similar Chesapeake Bay tributaries with similar salinity. This information is taken from DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html which shows the status and trends for various Chesapeake Bay areas. These maps allow qualitative comparison of regional conditions. Summary assessments are shown in tables for Ganey Wharf and Red Bridges.  10  Sept. 2002   Choptank River at Ganey Wharf Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data Poor Fair Fair Good Poor Poor Trend 1985 through 1999 Degrading Improving (29%) No Trend No Trend No Trend No Trend  Choptank River at Red Bridges (Greensboro) Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data Fair Fair n/a n/a n/a Good Trend 1985 through 1999 No Trend No Trend n/a n/a n/a No Trend  11  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment In 2001, Talbot County contracted with the University of Maryland Horn Point Laboratory to collect available water quality data for the waters in and around Talbot County and for water bodies in the Choptank River Basin generally. In late 2001, Horn Point Laboratory provided a draft GIS-based product designed to allow visualization of water quality conditions for numerous parameters. The following water quality assessment is drawn from Horn Point Laboratory's work. Map 6 Monitoring Water Quality shows the location of monitoring stations that were used in the Horn Point Laboratory project. As the map indicates, several different programs have recently collected data that contribute to understanding local water quality conditions. Immediately downstream of Tuckahoe Creek in the Choptank River is the most heavily sampled spot in the Upper Choptank River watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Program and most other programs operating in the watershed have sampled in this approximate location. The most wide spread sampling sites for the TMDL program were established relatively recently and will operate for only a few years to meet the needs of that program. In the following discussion, the description of the Creek Watchers program also includes an explanation of the potential benefits for monitoring selected water quality parameters. Additional sections follow that offer a brief interpretation of local water quality conditions based on particular water quality parameters. Additional water quality-related data is available via the Internet. Two recommended Web sites are www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html and www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . To view data for station ET5.2, which is in the Choptank River downstream of the Upper Choptank River watershed, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/conditions/index.html. 1. Creekwatchers Water Quality Sampling Beginning in 2001, volunteers with the Creekwatcher Program began sampling the Upper Choptank River. The Creekwatcher Program was created as a community partnership between the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) and the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum (CBMM). The goal of the Creekwatcher Program is to recruit and mobilize a grassroots volunteer force to monitor the waters of the bay tributaries in Talbot County. The data collected by the volunteers can be used to identify water quality conditions in different locations. Creekwatcher volunteers have monitored six river systems in Talbot County since July 1999 seven water bodies in addition to the Upper Choptank River: Miles River, Wye River, Harris Creek, Broad Creek, Tred Avon River, Island Creek and La Trappe Creek. The following water-quality measures were collected: Acidity (pH)-The pH level is directly related to the health of the fish and plants and in a healthy system, should be between 6.5 and 8.5. The most common causes of variations include stormwater runoff and air deposition of nitric and sulfuric acids discharged by industries, power plants, and automobiles. 12 Sept. 2002   Dissolved oxygen-Dissolved oxygen is essential to all marine life. Readings lower than 5 mg/l indicate insufficient oxygen to support aquatic life. Common causes of low readings include an increase in algae which consumes oxygen as it decomposes and seasonal changes in water salinity levels which can impact dissolved oxygen levels. Temperature-Temperature is important to maintaining healthy marine life. Industrial and municipal discharges and stormwater runoff can impact temperature levels. Temperature levels are dependent upon the season however; healthy levels should be < 30 degrees Celsius. Salinity-Salinity levels are an important water quality parameter and help to define which aquatic resources will live in the area. The salinity ranges change with the season and rainfall however, typical levels for Talbot County waters is around 15 ppt (or 1.5%) which is about half the salinity of the ocean. Turbidity-Turbidity measures the ability of light to pass through the water. Poor water clarity indicated by a low visual turbidity reading indicates that the water is not clear enough for light to penetrate to a depth to support the growth of underwater grasses. Healthy ranges are a visual turbidity reading greater than 3 feet. Conductivity-Conductivity measures the ability of water to conduct electricity. The more saline the water the higher the conductivity. Additionally, metals from discharges and stormwater runoff can impact conductivity readings. Healthy ranges are less than 25 MS/cm. Total Nitrogen (TN)& Total Phosphorus (TP)-Though essential to all bay life, nitrogen and phosphorus, in excessive levels, are the most significant pollutants baywide. Nitrogen and phosphorus are natural fertilizers that stimulate algae blooms. These blooms block sunlight from underwater grasses and, when the algae die, lead to low dissolved oxygen. Moreover, some naturally occurring algae may be toxic or have toxic stages in their life cycles. TN levels should be less than 1 mg/liter and TP levels should be less than 0.1 mg/liter Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV)- Several creeks have been monitored beginning in 2000. These grasses are essential habitat for young crabs and fish. They also help to stabilize shorelines, reduce erosion and reduce wave action that can also damage shorelines. 2. Salinity Salinity in the Upper Choptank River Choptank River Location Bow Knee Point to the Choptank Wetlands Preserve Choptank Wetlands Preserve to Tuckahoe Creek Upstream of Tuckahoe Creek Salinity in parts per thousand (ppt) Highly variable ranging from 0.1 to over 8.0 ppt, i.e. From nearly fresh to slightly brackish (low mesohaline) tends to be in the 0.1 to 3.0 ppt range but periods of salinity slightly higher than 7.0 ppt have been measured. generally less than 1.0 ppt  13  Sept. 2002   3. Dissolved Oxygen The most complete recent dissolved oxygen (DO) data is the Chesapeake Bay monitoring station ET5.2 which is in tidal waters downstream of the Upper Choptank watershed. This downstream station shows that tidal Choptank River waters in warm months generally exhibit low DO below the standard 5.0mg/l. Significantly less complete data for tidal stations on the Choptank River mainstem in the Upper Choptank River suggest that a similar, but less pronounced, pattern may be occurring. While most DO samples are above 5.0 mg/l, several samples collected between May and September fail to meet the standard. Nearly all nontidal monitoring stations report DO concentrations above the 5.0 mg/l standard. However, in Talbot County one station reported one very low DO concentration below 2.0 mg/l in the unnamed tributary at North Dover Road. In Caroline County, the station at Old Town Branch reported on concentration approaching 3 mg/l. 4. Secchi Depth On Map 7 Secchi Depth, average secchi depth measurements along the tidal Choptank River in the Upper Choptank River watershed show that monitoring sites with average secchi depths of at least one meter are interspersed with sites averaging less than one meter secchi depth. These differences may relate primarily to differing local hydrologic conditions. Where ever secchi depths of less than one meter are typical, the poor light penetration would tend to inhibit growth of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). 5. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Map 8 Total Suspended Solids shows that TSS concentrations tend to higher downstream of Tuckahoe Creek and tend to have the lowest concentrations upstream of Denton. Concentrations of 15 mg/l or greater for total suspended solids (TSS) is believed to generally inhibit growth of SAV because light can not penetrate to the plants' leaves. 6. Chlorophyll A As shown in Map 9 Chlorophyll A, the areas with the higher average chlorophyll a concentrations are generally between Denton and Tuckahoe Creek in the Choptank River. This finding indicates that higher average algae populations tend to be found in these upper reaches of tidal influence. Additional information and maps can be found at the Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Program Internet site www.cbrsp.org . This information shows the variability of algae populations in the entire Choptank River.  14  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base as summarized in the summary table below, there are 26 permitted surface water discharges and three permitted groundwater discharges in the Upper Choptank River watershed.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on two sources:  The 303(d) listing of the watershed for nutrients, sediments, and fecal coliform bacteria is believed to be associated with nonpoint sources.  Long term water quality monitoring data from Ganey Wharf indicates that nitrogen and suspended sediment concentrations are poor and phosphorus concentrations are fair. Upstream of this point in the river, point source loads are probably small compared to nonpoint source loads. Therefore, it is likely that nonpoint sources are the primary cause of degraded water quality at this location.  Long term water quality monitoring data from Red Bridges indicates that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are fair. Upstream of this point in the river, point sources are not significant. Consequently, nonpoint sources are the likely reason that water quality is not good at this location.  Modeled phosphorus load in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization indicates that a combination of factors in the watershed, including land use, would generally lead to excessive phosphors transport. To create an inventory of nonpoint sources for the Upper Choptank River WRAS, Talbot and Caroline Counties are considering urban stormwater and agricultural runoff separately. As part of urban nonpoint sources, rural residential communities are grouped with other types of urban land. In this exercise, the Counties are considering urban nonpoint sources in association with atmospheric deposition, stormwater runoff (managed and unmanaged), on-site disposal systems and illicit discharges.18 For example, it is believed that septic tanks, both failing and properly operating, are contributing nitrogen to the Choptank River. However, an inventory of septic tank locations and condition would need to be generated to planning and project targeting. Also for this exercise, agriculture nonpoint sources are being considered in association with atmospheric deposition, stormwater runoff (managed and unmanaged) and illicit discharges.18  19  Sept. 2002   Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 8 Shore Erosion Rate By County (Miles of Shoreline) County Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0-2 feet / year 9 91 2-4 feet / year 1 25 4 and greater feet / year 0 23  Caroline Talbot  66 442  10 (15%) 139 (31%)  The relatively limited shoreline erosion rates listed in the table for Caroline County account for most of the Choptank River shoreline in the Upper Choptank River watershed. These erosion rates are probably also indicative of Talbot County's shoreline in the watershed. The majority of the Talbot County's shoreline, as listed in the table above, is outside of the Upper Choptank River watershed along the Lower Choptank River and the Chesapeake Bay where erosion rates are generally higher. Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several years in Talbot and Caroline Counties. The maps also show relatively little change adjacent to smaller water bodies that are typical along the Choptank River in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS.  20  Sept. 2002   Water Supply The Upper Choptank River watershed has only one type of public water supply system. There are at least 24 public community groundwater systems in the watershed that use wells as their water source. These community water supply wells tend to draw from deep aquifers as summarized below. These deep aquifers are relatively distinct from surface water and shallow ground water. They are relatively unaffected by the water quality issues discussed elsewhere in this watershed characterization.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed landscape indicators for the Upper Choptank River watershed as summarized in sections that follow. 2 1. Impervious Surface On average across the entire Upper Choptank River watershed, 2.1% of surface cover is impervious. This average imperviousness compares well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Sideeffects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and in-stream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Reduction of impervious area can be a valuable component of a successful Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  22  Sept. 2002   2. Population Density The population density in the Upper Choptank River watershed was 0.16 people per acre using pre-2000 Census data. This density compares well with similar Maryland watersheds.2 To create a benchmark for comparing population density among Maryland watersheds, the people per acre for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. 3. Historical Wetland Loss The historical loss of wetlands in the Upper Choptank River watershed is estimated to be 48,169 acres which is a relatively large loss of wetlands compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed exceeded the benchmark because it is in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 49% of streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed were not buffered with trees based on 1998 information. This finding compares well with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) 23 Sept. 2002   This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed the benchmark. 5. Soil Erodibility The average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed is 0.28 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  24  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart 2000 Land Use summarize 2000 land use for the Upper Choptank Watershed in Maryland. Upper Choptank River Watershed Based on this information, the watershed Urban (8.27%) was dominated by agriculture (59%) and Wetlands (3.04%) Other (0.25%) forest (29%). The remaining approximately 12% of the land in the watershed was mostly developed lands Forest (29.29%) with small amounts of tidal and emergent Agriculture (59.16%) wetlands and other land uses. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 11 Generalized Land Use 2000 shows the distribution of these land categories in the watershed. 2000 Land Use Upper Choptank Watershed Category Agriculture Forest Developed Lands Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush Residential, commercial, etc. Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground (not graphed) Acres 93,886 46,485 13,124 4,818 395 158,708 163,449  Watershed Total for Land Use (excl. open water) Watershed Total including open water  25  Sept. 2002   Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 12 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  A significant number of Green Infrastructure hubs are found in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Many, but not all of these hubs are along the Choptank River and its tributaries. Also, many of these areas of natural vegetation have some association with wetlands and/or wet soils.  Many corridors selected by the computer analysis have significant amounts of agricultural land shown within the potential corridor. In general, viability of these corridors for protection or restoration requires local on-the-ground assessment to provide additional information regarding site conditions, land owner preferences and potential viability of projects.  26  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. Map 13 Protected Land and Smart Growth shows the locations of protected lands in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Based on the information summarized in the table, Protected Land Summary By County, several overall findings can be made:  Protection of agricultural land is the most active form of land conservation in the watershed. In total, agricultural easements encompass about 9,600 acres covering 6% of the watershed. Agricultural Districts encompass an additional 10,400 acres beyond the acreage under easements. This is an additional 6.5% of the watershed.  Conservation easements cover about 4,200 acres (2.6% of the watershed) including about 2,400 in Talbot County and over 1,800 acres in Caroline County. These figures include easements held by private organizations and by the Maryland Environmental Trust.  Government owned land in the Upper Choptank watershed amounts to less than half of one percent of the watershed. No federal land is identified there. Caroline County has about 178 acres of park land in the watershed. DNR land in the watershed encompasses 460 acres including about 300 acres recently acquired from Chesapeake Forest, Inc. Other DNR land in the watershed includes a small portion of Seth Forest in Talbot County and Marinak State Park in Caroline County. In drafting the WRAS for the Upper Choptank Watershed in Talbot and Caroline Counties, existing protected lands could be assessed for their potential role in watershed management:  Public land could be assessed for potential implementation and/or demonstration project sites.  Land owner interests could be surveyed regarding opportunities for management enhancement like agricultural best management practices.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels  27  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary By County Upper Choptank River Watershed In Maryland* Area Category Talbot Acres Agricultural Easement Agricultural District** Conservation Easement: MET *** Conservation Easement: Private County Parks DNR Land Total Protected Land In County/Watershed Total County Land In Watershed 1,038 2,807 2,162 235 0 12 6,254 36,575 % 3 8 6 0.6 --17 100 Caroline Acres 8,526 7,636 1,186 641 178 448 18,615 120,982 % 7 6 1 0.5 0.1 0.4 15 100 Queen Annes Acres 84 0 0 0 0 0 84 1,937 % 4 -----4 100  * Data in the table is from late 2000 or earlier depending on the category. ** Agricultural Districts provide various advantages to farmers but do not inhibit land owner decisions to change farm land to nonagricultural land uses in the long term. *** MET - Maryland Environmental Trust  28  Sept. 2002   Smart Growth Within Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 13 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Rural Legacy Area in the Upper Choptank watershed is concentrated near Tuckahoe Creek. A little over 5400 acres of the Tuckahoe Rural Legacy area are in the WRAS watershed. State funding for the Tuckahoe Rural Legacy area was appropriated in State fiscal years 1999 and 2000. - Priority Funding Areas in Caroline County, they are associated with several small communities. Collectively, these areas include nearly 4,100 acres covering a little over 11% of the Upper Choptank watershed in Talbot County. - Priority Funding Areas in Talbot County are concentrated around Easton and the Route 50 corridor. All together these areas total nearly 3,900 acres covering slightly more than 3% of the Upper Choptank watershed in Caroline County.  29  Sept. 2002   Soils 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Surveys for Talbot and Caroline Counties show. This complicated information Natural Soil Groups can be effectively summarized using Natural Soil Upper Choptank River Watershed Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. In Map 14 Soils and the pie chart, prime farmland is depicted in yellow or yellow with (26.32%) crosshatching. About 56% of the Upper Choptank Watershed in Maryland is prime (48.58%) farmland based on the list below: (8.21%)  48.6% 7.4% 9.5% 8.2% 26.3%  - Best prime agriculture soil (B1) Other prime agriculture soil Excessively well drained soil Wet soils in flood zones - Wet soils in uplands  (9.45%) (7.43%)  2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations related to wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development. Land owners in the watershed have tended to leave many of these areas in natural vegetation or other low intensity use. By comparing Map 14 Soils with Map 11 1997 General Land Use and Map 12 Green Infrastructure several tendencies can be seen. Green Infrastructure and forest in general tends to coincide with soils that are either hydric & poorly drained or with soils that are excessively well drained. Additionally, development, which often relies on septic systems, tends to be concentrated on excessively well drained soils and to avoid hydric soils. Considering the existing tendencies among landowners suggested above, Natural Soils Groups or similar soils assessment techniques can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  30  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories The Eastern Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high groundwater table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant on the Eastern Shore but are represented in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.)  31  Sept. 2002   2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program show that a net increase of wetland acreage of nearly 11 acres has occurred in the Upper Choptank River watershed over the past 10 years.

Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998.  32  Sept. 2002   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in most of the Upper Choptank River watershed tend to occur along waterways as shown in the maps listed below. However, the map also shows that wetland in the northern end of the watershed tend to be more defuse and they are less likely to associated with waterways. - Map 15A Wetlands - South - Map 15B Wetlands - Central - Map 15C Wetlands - North In comparing the wetlands map to Map 11 1997 Generalized Land Use, it can be seen that much of the forested land in the watershed is found in association with wetlands or adjacent to them. Additionally, comparing National Wetlands Inventory Acreage Summary the maps shows that many Upper Choptank River Watershed of the nontidal wetland Wetland Class Acres areas on the wetland maps Estuarine, Subtidal (E1) unconsolidated 3 are depicted as forest on bottom the land use map.

See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  33  Sept. 2002   Floodplains Map 16 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100-year floodplain extends far up tributaries to the Choptank River. The extent of potential flood areas in the Upper Choptank River watershed has significant implications for land use decisions and watershed management including potential restoration projects. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these new projects may not significantly improve water quality or quantity that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. However, consideration of retrofits must take into account at least two local issues: - Land owner interests and preferences. - Management directions already established by Public Drainage Associations (PDAs)  Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Most areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. However, marshes and other low-lying wetlands are at risk for inundation. The potential for sea level rise impacts need to be considered as part of any comprehensive watershed management effort. For example, the identification and prioritization of potential WRAS projects will take into account the risk of inundation during the life of the project. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Maryland-wide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report.9 At this statewide scale, the general area at risk to inundation from sea level rise is limited to marsh/wetland areas along the Choptank River. As shown in Map 16 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise, the area of concern in the Upper Chotank River watershed extends from Bow Knee Point to Barker Creek just upstream of the Choptank Wetlands Preserve. A significant portion of the Choptank Wetlands Preserve is at risk for inundation.  34  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Upper Choptank River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Upper Choptank River Watershed.2 Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS: 1. SAV Abundance Index For tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.5"" for the Abundance Index which means that SAV covered about15% of the potential SAV habitat. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this index, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. 35 Sept. 2002   The benchmark used for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Requirements Index For tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""5.0"" for the Habitat Requirement Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used for the SAV Habitat Requirements Index was 7. A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed in the category for ""needs preventative action"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed are generally in poor condition on average based on assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate communities (stream bugs). For this index, Liberty Reservoir streams scored an average of 4.9 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. To generate this index, each stream site that is assessed is compared to reference conditions that were established for comparable streams that are minimally impacted. Nontidal rivers (streams seventh order and larger) are not incorporated into this index. Also see Why Look at Benthos in Streams? 4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Based on assessment of fish communities, streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed scored 6.5 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) indicating a generally fair/good condition on average. For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. In each stream site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. To generate the index for the watershed, the scores for all the stream sites assessed within the 8-digit watershed are averaged together.  36  Sept. 2002   5. Nontidal In-Stream Habitat Index Based on habitat conditions in nontidal streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed, conditions are generally fair on average. In this index, Upper Choptank River streams scored an average of 4.9 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). This index allows comparison of streams based on habitat for fish and benthic organisms as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. For each site, the individual scores are integrated to generate a single score for each stream site. The index score reported for each stream site is a relative score to the maximum attainable score for comparable streams. The watershed index is created by averaging the scores for all the sites that were assessed in the watershed.  37  Sept. 2002   Fish 1. Striped Bass Spawning and Nursery The Upper Choptank River is one of the most important spawning and nursery areas for striped bass (rock fish) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In terms of size and productivity, the Upper Choptank ranks third (behind 1. Upper Chesapeake Bay and 2. Potomac River). Within the Upper Choptank River, the area most used by striped bass for spawning and nursery extends from near Denton to approximately Bow Knee Point.17 2. Juvenile Fish Survey DNR Fisheries Service conducts numerous surveys to gauge the condition of fisheries and some of the sampling sites have been located in the Upper Choptank River. The Bay-wide Estuarine Juvenile Finfish Survey samples 22 sites each year including one in the Upper Choptank River near Denton and three other sites downstream in the Choptank River. Additionally the annual Blue Crab Survey includes five stations in the Choptank River. As shown in the graph below taken from the DNR Fisheries Service Internet site, 2001 was an excellent recruitment year for young-of-year (YOY) striped bass in the Choptank River. Additionally, 2001 in the Choptank River was an excellent year for young-of-year atlantic menhaden, a good year for white perch and yellow perch and poor year for some species. For additional information see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/juvindex/index.html .  YOY Striped Bass 1957-2001 Choptank R.

Tidal Largemouth Bass Studies 1998-200110 The Eastern Regional Staff of Freshwater Fisheries has sampled the Upper Choptank for largemouth bass abundance since the 1980's. In 1999, the survey techniques were changed to increase overall precision, and to better address the correlation between largemouth bass abundance and habitat quality. Roughly forty 250m stations representing prime, average and marginal habitats were sampled each year using an electofishing boat to collect data on largemouth bass and other recreationally important species. The results of these data were encouraging; the bass population in the Upper Choptank appears to be stable or slowly increasing over the three-year study period. Catchper-unit effort (CPUE) for all bass collected per 100m increased over time from 1.52 in 1999, 1.69 in 2000 to 2.25 in 2001. Similarly, CPUE of young-of-year bass has increased as well from 1999-2001. Overall, when compared to other fisheries, the Upper Choptank River supports an excellent fishery for tidal largemouth bass. It is described by consistent reproduction and a balanced age and size structure of bass in optimal physical condition. Bass abundance was highest in areas of prime habitat characterized by areas with an abundance of structure, adjacent deep water and tidal current breaks. Continued growth of SAV beds in the river will undoubtedly enhance the fishery by creating additional prime habitat.

Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries harvest information for the Choptank River is tracked by DNR Fisheries Service. While this information aggregates Upper Choptank River information into the Choptank River-wide information, it provides some indication of local conditions. Also see http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mdcomfish/mdcomfishery.html .  Blue Crabs: For the entire Choptank River, the annual commercial harvest ranged from 6 million pounds in 1994 to 3,346,000 pounds in 1999. The harvest decline during this period appears to be consistent with a similar trend throughout the Chesapeake Bay.  Oysters: There are no current or historic oyster bars in Upper Choptank River watershed. Additionally, there are no oyster lease areas in the vicinity. The closest oyster bars are about three miles downstream of Bow Knee Point near the mouth of the Warwick River, Dorchester County.13  Striped Bass: The commercial harvest data for the entire Choptank River extends all the way back to 1929. Over the 70-year period from 1929 to 1999, the annual striped bass harvest in the Choptank River occasionally exceeded 200,000 pounds prior to 1976. Since that time, the annual harvest has been significantly smaller. 1998 was the highest harvest year during the 1990s yielding around 135,000 pounds. 5. Recreational Fish Stock Assessment 11 During 2000, DNR Fisheries Service conducted an extensive effort across the Chesapeake Bay to assess the status of selected fish species that are important for recreational activities. Part of this effort involved sampling of Upper Choptank River fish in the vicinity of the Tuckahoe Creek confluence using experimental fyke nets at five locations. The report on this work, released in 2001, included several findings that may be relevant to the Upper Choptank River WRAS:11  Channel Catfish recruitment in the Choptank River may have improved recently. A higher percentage of 2 to 5 year years amoung the population was found in 1999 and the absolute numbers of channel catfish between 200 mm and 310 mm length increased substantially in 1999 and 2000. From 1993 to 1998 the most frequently found length among channel catfish was consistently increasing. However, 1999 and 2000 surveys suggest that this trend may be reversing.  White Catfish populations in the Choptank River may be expanding based on trends toward increasing length and increasing pre-recruit abundance. Their numbers counted during 2000 were greater than any year since 1993. The fyke net catches in the Choptank River were nine times the level in 1998.  White Perch populations appear to be stable (based on relatively constant length frequencies).  Yellow Perch netted in the 2000 survey indicated continuing strong recruitment in the Choptank River in recent years. The 1996 year-class accounted for 60% of the yellow perch population.  40  Sept. 2002   6. Fish Consumption Advisory In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories. The advisory recommended limiting consumption of channel catfish and white perch caught in the mainstem of the Choptank River due to PCB and/or pesticide contamination. The complete advisory list is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html . MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to the revised advisory to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing. Two sampling stations for this effort were located in the Upper Choptank River watershed as shown in Map 6 Monitoring Water Quality: near the mouth of Hog Creek and at Red Bridges near the Sewell Mills USGS gauging station. Seven additional sampling stations were located elsewhere in the Choptank River Basin  41  Sept. 2002   Maryland Biological Stream Survey  15, 16  Brief summaries of the findings by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) for sampling years from 1994 through 2000 are presented here. More complete information on MBSS findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Findings in the benthic and fish indexes may be used in identifying potential areas for stream protection or restoration. Sampling of streams in the Upper Choptank wateshed by MBSS will likely be scheduled again in 2005 at the earliest. However, sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program could occur sooner if sufficient interest arises. 1. Benthos in Nontidal Streams Assessment of benthos or benthic macroinvertebrates is an valuable way to interpret stream conditions based on organisms living in the stream. The text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams explains the importance of benthos in streams. Assessment of benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos in the Upper Choptank River watershed for the period 1994 through 2000 is presented in Map 17 Benthic Index:     Good: 14% All but one are downstream of Denton. Fair: 22% Scattered throughout the watershed but mostly downstream of Denton. Poor: 36% Scattered throughout the watershed. Very Poor: 28% These sites are scattered but most tend to be upstream of Denton.  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has a benthic population and habitat conditions that are close to those found in a comparable ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poorly deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. 2. Fish in Nontidal Streams In Map 18 Fish Index, an assessment of fish populations and habitat conditions in the Upper Choptank River watershed for the period 1994 through 2000 are presented:     Good: 26% Fair: 48% Poor: 26% Very Poor: one site  42  Sept. 2002   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  43  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 19 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Upper Choptank watershed. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  44  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Upper Choptank River Watershed  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 18 SSPRAs are identified in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 19 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Upper Choptank River watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) Numerous small WSSCs are designated in the Upper Choptank River watershed. At least of these areas are visible on Map 19 Sensitive Species but most are not visible. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  45  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation SAV beds in the Upper Choptank River watershed are small and limited to narrow areas along the shoreline. This is, in part, due to the depth of the river channel which limits the area of potential physical habitat in the Upper Choptank River.12 These areas are too small to be identified in the remote sensing data that is publicly available via DNR's MERLIN Internet mapping tool which shows data for each year from 1984 through 1999. (Also see www.vims.edu/bio/sav/ for extensive information or www.mdmerlin.net for annual distribution maps 1984 through 1996). Interest in restoring SAV in the Choptank River is currently on the rise. A ""Grasses for the Masses"" workshop for the Choptank River was held February 2002. The workshop by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) and Horn Point Laboratory encouraged local people to grow SAV at home for transplantation to the Choptank River in spring 2002. In general, transplantation sites were in the Lower Choptank River.  46  Sept. 2002   RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. DNR has proposed a partnership with Talbot and Caroline Counties to conduct a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Using this approach, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps would walk along streams and other significant waterways to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report of findings for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Working from 2002 sampling in the Upper Choptank River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  47  Sept. 2002   Agricultural Conservation Programs Both Caroline and Talbot Counties have significant levels of participation conservation programs. Farmers in these counties willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Soil and Water Conservation Districts in these counties work with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Soil and Water Conservation Districts and the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. In the Upper Choptank River watershed, three marinas are located in the Caroline County and none in Talbot County as shown in Map 20 Marinas. Of these marinas, only one offers pumpout facilities. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  48  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. However, blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. The distribution of fish blockages known to exist in the Upper Choptank River watershed in 2001 and earlier are shown in Map 21 Fish Blockages. The map shows that all currently known blockages in the Upper Choptank River watershed are in Caroline County. Four previously existing blockages that have been corrected are also show on the map and are listed in the table Corrected Fish Blockages. One corrected blockage is in Talobt County and the other three corrected blockages are on Herring Run and Broadway Branch in Caroline County. All immediately available information on fish blockages is from the DNR's Fish Blockage Database. DNR's Fisheries Service uses this information to help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal. A summary of the 21 currently identified blockages listed in the Upper Choptank River watershed appears in the table Fish Blockage Removal Opportunities. In general, removal of a fish blockage is recommended if its correction would open a large stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. Some of these blockages to fish movement may be structural components of farm ponds, drainage ditches, etc. If a blockage is found to be in this category, circumstances like requirements for drainage control function and public or land owner needs are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project. The list of fish blockage removal opportunities should be considered as supporting information to help guide additional site assessments and planning for blockage removal. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that a Stream Corridor Assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. As part of the WRAS project, local government and other constituencies may elect to either provide input into DNR's fish blockage removal priorities or to generate a list of local priorities.  49  Sept. 2002   Corrected Fish Blockages Upper Choptank River Watershed Blockage Corrected Site ID CP004 CP005 CPU01 CPU02 County Stream Herring Run Herring Run Beaverdam Branch Broadway Branch Name / Location Dam #1 on Herring Run Dam #2 on Herring Run Beaverdam Creek Weir, near Rt 328 Lake Bonnie Dam, south of Greenboro  1996 1996 1989 1997  CO CO TA CO  50  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Opportunities in the Upper Choptank River Watershed Site ID CP001 CP002 CP006 CPU03 CPU05 CPU06 CPU07 CPU08 CPU09 CPU10 CPU11 CPU13 CPU14 CPU16 CPU18 CPU20 CPU21 CPU22 CPU23 CPU24 CPU25 County Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Stream Chapel Branch Choptank River trib to Skeleton Creek Burrsville Branch Choptank River Choptank River Engle Ditch/ Chapel Br.

Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 52 Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater (First Order) streams tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. In general, restoration of stream buffers has been an agricultural Best Management Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates Practice (BMP), with less By Land Use applicability in urban areas. Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) By identifying land uses in Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment riparian areas with inadequate (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) stream buffers, like crop land adjacent to streams, the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 potential to reduce nutrient Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 and sediment loads can be improved. To assist in finding Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 areas with crop land adjacent to streams, the same land use Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 data shown in Map 11 Generalized Land Use 2000 can be filtered using GIS. The land use / land cover information selectively shown in Map 22 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging naturally vegetated stream buffers 50 feet wide on each 53 Sept. 2002   side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Upper Choptank, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 23 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also lack stream buffers in the Upper Choptank River watershed. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. A revision of the above scenario is shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Scenario: Hydric Soils On Cropland . The presentation in this map is based on the same hydric soil data as the previous map but refines the area highlighted by showing only hydric soils that were used for cropland in 2000. This scenario suggests areas where current agricultural stream buffer restoration programs may be focused. 6. Wetland Associations Wetlands and adjacent natural uplands form complex habitats that offer a range of habitat opportunities for many species. These ""habitat complexes"" tend to offer greater species diversity and other ecological values that are greater than the values that the wetland or uplands could offer independently. Therefore, restoring stream buffers adjacent to or near existing wetlands tends to offer greater habitat benefits than the restoration project could otherwise produce. Map 25 Stream Buffer Wetland Proximity Scenario identifies unforested buffer zones that are in close proximity (within 300 feet) to wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory). Restoration projects in these areas may offer opportunities to enhance and expand wetland habitat in addition to providing other desirable buffer functions. 54 Sept. 2002   7. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Upper Choptank River watershed, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in the Choptank River arise from multiple states and counties, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in the river mainstem. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  55  Sept. 2002   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Limiting or reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to finding candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils using GIS. The GIS maps can help initiate a candidate site search process, assist in discussions with willing land owners and targeting site investigations. For the Upper Choptank River watershed, a GIS scenarios were developed as described below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (MDP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Identify hydric soils on open land that are close to existing wetlands or streams. Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that wetland restoration opportunities are numerous throughout the watershed.  Map 24 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils On Cropland Scenario shows stream buffer restoration opportunities are reasonably common across the watershed. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership, etc. Next steps that could also be beneficial are considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  56  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is funding a project that includes the Upper Choptank River watershed. This Maryland Dept. of Agriculture project is known as the Progressive Management Practices for Lower Eastern Shore Public Drainage Associations (PDAs). To date, the project has been funded in Federal fiscal year 1999 and 2000. Additional funding is proposed for Federal fiscal 2002. The project is intended to improve water quality in the Lower Eastern Shore by installing best management practices on PDAs to reduce the amount of sediment flow and nutrients into rivers that receive agricultural drainage by:  Installing weirs or other water control structures on 50 miles of public drainage systems for water quality improvement.  Demonstrating the viability of pocket wetland systems on public drainage systems on the Lower Eastern Shore.  Providing cost-share funds for repair and stabilization of emergency blowouts, channel obstructions and weir maintenance on existing PDAs for water quality protection.  Providing cost-share funds to increase PDA buffer protection and maintenance areas up to 35 feet from the drainage system center line.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Agricultural / PDA BMP Monitoring The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) and DNR will begin monitoring several agricultural areas served by Public Drainage Associations (PDAs) on Maryland's Eastern Shore in summer 2002. The intent of the project is gather information on the water quality affects of selected 57 Sept. 2002   Best Management Practices (BMPs). Some of this information will be collected in the Upper Choptank River watershed. This locally collected information can also be used to better quantify water quality conditions in the drainage ditches where the monitoring is stationed. 2. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) The CRP program pays farmers on a per acre basis to remove fields from production. One of numerous benefits from the program is reduction of sediment and nutrient movement into streams. 3. Conservation and Restoration Enhancement Program (CREP) The CREP program reimburses farmers who restore stream riparian areas to natural vegetation. Under the program, this land creates new or enhanced stream buffer which is placed under a conservation easement. 4. Greenways The Year 2000 edition of the Maryland Greenways Atlas identifies Greenway and Green Infrastructure projects and issues that include the Upper Choptank River watershed area: - Easton-Clayton Rail Trail (recreational greenway) is proposed to extend through the Upper Choptank River watershed from the existing section completed in 1998 in Talbot County. As proposed, the completed project would extend outside of the watershed and then eventually re-enter the watershed in Caroline County to extend through Hillsboro, Ridgely and Goldsboro. - Choptank and Tuckahoe River Water Trail has been proposed as a partnership between Talbot County, Caroline County and private citizens that would establish an official water trail. This portion of the Choptank River within the Upper Choptank River watershed would build on the existing popularity among canoe and kayak enthusiasts. - Denton Municipal Greenway proposal would connect Denton to Martinak State Park on the Choptank River within the WRAS watershed. - Hillsboro Rail Trail is a proposal for a recreational greenway on an inactive railroad spur between Hillsboro and Denton. - Upper Choptank River Greenway is proposed to be an ecological and recreational greenway. It would follow the Choptank River (in the Upper Choptank River watershed) connecting the County Christian Park to the boat ramp in Greensboro.  58  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Breton Bay Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 59 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. CWiC Criteria #3-- Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  60  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES 1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

These watersheds have been adopted by State agencies as one of several standardized approaches to analyzing and sharing information across the State of Maryland. The table is broken into three segments consistent with the three maps that match three maps entitled Stream and Subwatersheds in the Upper Choptank River Watershed Characterization. One key identifier for subwatersheds relates the tables and maps: - in the table, the second column contains a three digit number - on the maps, the same three digit number is a unique identifier shown for each subwatershed. (These are the same subwatersheds mapped by DNR/MDE for the entire state known as ""12-digit watersheds.) Example: - on Map 3A, the stream Beaverdam Branch, which is east of Easton, is near the top of the map. - the map labels the Beaverdam Branch subwatershed as ""483"". - on table ""Stream Summary for Map 3A"", look either for ""Beaverdam Branch"" or ""483"" - the table shows that DNR GIS system shows 17 linear miles of stream for Beaverdam Branch  Additional Notes: 12-Digit Name - A unique number assigned by DNR to each ""12-Digit Watershed"" in the State. The table truncates the leading zero (example 0472 in the table is 472). Potential Watershed Name - Most of the ""12-Digit Watersheds"" designated by DNR do not have an official English name. The names listed here are offered only to raise the issue and to promote clear communication. Stream Miles. This estimate is based on Statewide large-scale map digitization rounded to the nearest whole mile. Other sources, like the County's Planning and Zoning Maps, probably show additional stream reaches not included in the statewide data. Lakes and ponds that appear on USGS Quad Maps as open water were digitized with a left and a right shoreline. Therefore, the stream miles estimate reflects an estimate of the water body's perimeter.  100  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3A 12-Digit Count & Number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 Skeleton Creek Marsh Creek Little Creek Mitchell Run Crowberry Creek Williams Creek  Upper Choptank River - South Section Stream Miles Total 11 89 <1 25 19 8 5 8 4 3 11 17 11  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 4,448 22,110 1,701 5,591 4,232 1,979 880 2,780 1,138 1,288 4,165 4,766 3,524  Potential Watershed Name  Miles Creek Headwaters Miles, Kings, Turkey Creeks  Kings Creek Headwaters Galloway and Wootenaux Creeks Beaverdam Branch Hog Creek  101  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3B 12-Digit Count & Number 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 0485 0486 0487 0488 0489 0490 0491 0492 0493 0494 0495 0496 0497 0498 0499 0500 Spring Branch Chapel Branch Watts Creek Herring Run Mill Creek  Upper Choptank River  Central Section Stream Miles Total 29 17 32 9 6 12 7 25 5 31 20 2 10 3 12 13  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 9,334 4,050 5,036 6,355 1,519 5,228 1,116 7,977 606 10,284 4,083 488 2,050 347 829 3,550  Potential Watershed Name  Fowling Creek Robins Creek  102  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3C 12-Digit Count & Number 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 0501 0502 0503 0504 0505 0506 0507 0508 0509 0510 0511 0512 0513 0514 0515  Upper Choptank River  North Section Stream Miles Total 14 11 6 7  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 3,442 3,760 1,947 2,334 5,611 1,650 2,250 2,732 4,729 4,067 645 635 1,242 3,444 3,754 163,699  Potential Watershed Name  Tubmill Branch Gravelly Branch  Lower Forge Branch Forge Branch west headwaters Forge Branch north headwaters Oldtown Branch Broadway Branch Choptank River near Rt 287  29 9 13 13 18 19 <1 3 5  Coolspring Branch Harrington Beaverdam Branch Upper Choptank River Watershed  15 13 564  TOTAL  103  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B  Delaware's Upper Choptank River Watershed  Delaware Department of Natural Resource and Environmental Control ( DNREC ) Watershed Assessment Section  104  Sept. 2002"

Kent County applied for grant funding and volunteered to develop a strategy in the watershed to improve water quality using protection and restoration projects. The purpose of the Watershed Characterization is to assist Kent County in collecting information and identifying issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. The Middle Chester River watershed encompasses about 37,400 acres of land in Kent and Queen Annes County. Over 2,000 acres of open water in the Chester River separate the two Counties creating hydrologically distinct drainage areas on either side of the River. Approximately 29,600 acres of land are in the Kent County WRAS area. Within the WRAS area, the very rural and agricultural Morgan Creek watershed drains about 22,200 acres. The relatively developed Radcliffe Creek watershed containing Chestertown drains about 4030 acres. The remainder of the Kent County Middle Chester River WRAS area consists of minor watersheds draining directly to the Chester River. Water Quality The Middle Chester River does not support its designated use (water contact recreation) due to problems associated with nutrients, fecal coliforms and sediment. Nearly all of the water quality information available for the Middle Chester River watershed is for the Chester River mainstem where water quality is poor in general. In this area of the mainstem, water clarity is the worst of the Chesapeake Bay ""segments"" for the period 1992 through 1997. Several water quality parameters, including water clarity, algae and phosphorus, are showing a recent trend toward improvement. Toxicity in river water and sediment from two Middle Chester River sites did not cause significant mortality for minnows or clams under laboratory conditions. However, in terms of inhibiting growth of these organisms, toxicity was ranked as high or moderately high for river water and for sediment from the sites tested. DDT and Dieldrin, which were found here, may have contributed to an observed reduction in growth rate. Based on the relatively little information available on nontidal streams in the Middle Chester River watershed, few generalizations can be put forward. For Radcliffe Creek, low summer dissolved oxygen and assessment of benthic organisms found there suggests that high nutrient levels may be present. Very poor water quality associated with nutrients and sedimentation in Urieville Lake is a well known local condition. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) issued for the Lake in 1999 called for a 42% reduction in sediment load and an 85% reduction in total phosphorus load.  v   Land Use Land in Kent County / Middle Chester River watershed is among the most productive agricultural land in Maryland. The watershed is nearly all privately owned and is about three quarters agricultural land. However, soil erodibility is high, which presents a challenge for managers of land and water quality. The majority of the forested land in the watershed is associated with wetlands and wet soil conditions. Developed lands are projected to increase over the next twenty years primarily at the expense of farm land. The majority of the limited acreage in the watershed that is protected from development is privately owned with either agricultural or conservation easements providing the protection. Living Resources and Habitat Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has not been found in the Middle Chester River area during the period 1978 through 1999 when annual aerial survey monitoring was conducted. Long-time residents of the Chestertown area recall that SAV was abundant in the 1950s and 1960s in the Middle Chester River. Current-day SAV absence is linked to poor water clarity and other factors. Little information is available for living resources associated with nontidal streams in the Middle Chester River watershed. Analysis of benthic organism populations and habitat was conducted at two Middle Chester River sites. Radcliffe Creek was rated as ""not supporting"" benthic species. Morgan Creek near Urieville Lake (but not down stream of it) was rated as ""partially supporting"" benthic species. Interpretation of fish populations upstream of Urieville Lake rated the biotic integrity of two tributary streams ""fair"" and ""good."" However, fish populations in Urieville Lake itself are poor due to its eutrophic condition. Restoration Targeting Tools A stream corridor assessment is scheduled for Winter 2000/2001. It will identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion, etc. This information will provide a foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. Opportunities were also identified to address fish blockages and to reduce overboard sewage discharge from boats that could potentially use marina pumpout facilities. Additional Information The DNR Chester River Study is anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. It will provide analysis of Chester River mainstem water quality and living resources.  vi   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies. Kent County is one of five Counties participating in the first round of the WRAS program. The portion of the Middle Chester River Watershed within Kent County is the area selected for restoration. This watershed has several key physical characteristics: coastal plain location, low to moderate elevation, moderate terrain with limited areas of steep slope, and generally rural land uses with development mostly clustered in and around Chestertown. Location The Middle Chester River watershed is located within the Chester River basin as shown in Map 1 Regional Context . The majority of the Middle Chester River watershed is in Kent County, Maryland. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. Map 2 Middle Chester River Watershed WRAS Project Area shows the geographic Acreage Summary location of the WRAS watershed in County Land Water Total Maryland. In addition, about 23% of the watershed is in Queen Anne's County, Kent 29,611 1,286 30,897 Maryland. As shown in Map 3 Streams and Queen Anne's 7,825 1,211 9,036 Sub-Watersheds, the two Counties are on opposite sides of the Chester River. Watershed Total 37,436 2,497 39,933 Therefore, their subwatersheds are hydrologically distinct. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information  identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. 1   Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be a starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2      WATER QUALITY Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. A simplified summary of the Designated Uses in the Middle Chester watershed is listed below. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 7 - Use I: for water contact recreation and aquatic life: All waters not designated as Use II - Use II: for shellfish harvesting: Tidal waters downstream of Route 213. - No other designated uses are established in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings Significant portions of the Middle Chester River either do not support their designated use or partially do not support their designated use.2 As required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act, Maryland tracks waterways that did not support their designated use in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments."" The Middle Chester River is referenced twice: - Nutrients. In the 1996 303(d) list, the Chester River (which includes the Middle Chester River) is listed as Priority #4 among many priorities. Nutrients from point, nonpoint and natural sources are identified as the problem. - Nutrients, Fecal Coliform, Suspended Sediment . In the 1996 303(d) list, the Middle Chester River is also listed separately for nutrients, fecal coliform and suspended sediment from nonpoint & natural sources. The 303(d) priority referenced above is established by the Maryland Department of the Environment. Information considered in setting these priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem and the extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies. These priorities are used to help set State work schedules various programs including total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). Nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. The nutrients of primary concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. In general, an acre of forest land contributes the smaller amounts of nutrients than other lands. Residential land can be important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully control nutrients so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Fecal coliforms are bacteria that are used as a measure of contamination from human and animal waste. 6   Suspended sediment arises from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Construction sites, crop land and bare ground are common contributors. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon management controls that are used.  National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 18 The productivity of many coastal marine [and estuary] systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and  7   Water Quality Indicators The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following water quality indicators for the Middle Chester River.3 The Middle Chester River is also identified in the Plan as a Category 1 Priority Watershed ""in need of restoration during the next two years."" For more details on the Clean Water Action Plan see www.dnr.state.md.us/cwap/ Water Quality Indicator State 303(d) Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Finding ""3"" Rank Fail Bench Mark This watershed is included in the 303(d) list. Impairment Number 3 means that additional protection is needed. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the 34 (25%) with the highest nitrogen loads. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the 104 (75%) with the lower phosphorus loads.  9.66 lbs/acre  Fail  Modeled TP Load  0.62 lbs/acre  Pass  See Interpreting Water Quality Indicators for additional information.  8   Interpreting Water Quality Indicators State 303(d) Impairment Number. This number is used to characterize watersheds relative to regulatory requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. It is based on numerous water quality-related factors that are tracked by the State of Maryland under these federal requirements. Modeled TN Load. TN refers to Total Nitrogen. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching local streams. This method was applied Statewide to all the 138 watersheds in Maryland to allow comparison of ""modeled total nitrogen load"" among them. A rank of ""fail"" means that this watershed was among the 34 watersheds (25%) that had the highest estimated total nitrogen load. High nitrogen levels in tidal waters and lakes are often associated with poor water quality. Modeled TP Load. TP refers to Total Phosphorus. It is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. (Note: details of the models differ.) The rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total phosphorus load.  9   Tributary Team Characterization As part of the work of the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Middle Chester River water quality was characterized several parameters that are listed below. 1, 9 The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, poor means that the Middle Chester River ranking is poor compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. This information is taken from DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html which includes maps of the Upper Eastern Shore of Maryland showing the status and trends for rivers near the Middle Chester River. These maps allow qualitative comparison of regional conditions. Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data poor poor poor poor poor poor Trend 1985 through 1999 no trend improving (29%) improving (22%) no trend improving (53%) no trend  Water Quality Assessment It is anticipated that DNR will release a report, tentatively called the DNR Chester River Study, during Winter 2001. It will include information as described below that was collected at the sampling stations shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations labeled as ""mainstem"" and ""additional"" stations:  Water and Sediment samples were gathered in 1995 to establish baseline concentrations for metals and select pesticides. These samples were collected at the ten mainstem stations.  A suite of nutrient parameters was measured monthly in 1999 at 30 sampling stations.  Several water quality parameters were measured at each sampling station. 1. Clarity Water clarity in the Chester River mainstem in the vicinity of the Middle Chester was the worst of any Chesapeake Bay tidal segment during the 1992-1997 time frame. 23 This condition, translated into living resource terms, indicates that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) can not grow in the Middle Chester River unless water clarity is improved. Based on data collected from monitoring station 10   ET4.1 upstream of the Middle Chester in the Chester River mainstem, this problem is arising, at least in part, upstream of the Middle Chester. For example, information is available indicating that at least one of the Upper Chester River subwatersheds contributes nutrients (total nitrogen) at a rate among the highest in the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. 24 These nutrients would tend to drive algae growth in the River which reduces water clarity. To view data for station ET4.1, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/conditions/index.html. 2. Dissolved Oxygen Analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO) samples collected in the Middle Chester River watershed show a range of conditions. DO in the Chester River was consistently above the water quality standard of 5.0 mg/L. 20 In very limited sampling of nontidal streams, summer DO in Radcliffe Creek fell below 5.0 mg/L water quality standard. 21 This is a level which stresses or eliminates some aquatic life. Urieville Lake DO has been found at extremely low concentrations -- as little as 0.1 mg/L. 13 Many species of aquatic life can not survive in these conditions. Additional water quality-related data is available via the Internet. Two recommended Web sites are www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html and www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . 3. Nutrients In Radcliffe Creek, potentially elevated nutrient concentrations were cited in one study as a contributing factor for benthic conditions in 1992 and 1993. This study recommended Radcliffe Creek as a candidate for more exhaustive nutrient analyses. 21 A comparison of the modeled nutrient estimates in the Water Quality Indicator section and the nutrient status and trends in the Tributary Team Characterization section shows the limitations of currently available nutrient information:  Nutrient data for Middle Chester River tributaries was not available for the Watershed Characterization with the exception of the Radcliffe Creek data summarized above.  The Water Quality Indicator modeled nutrient loads are based on estimated loads generated by nutrient sources in the watershed using average loading rates for each land use type.  The Tributary Team Characterization is based on water quality data collected in the Chester River mainstem which includes nutrient loads from all sources upstream of the Middle Chester River. For total nitrogen, the modeled indicator (fail) and Tributary Team Characterization (poor) seem consistent even though the two are measuring differing nitrogen source areas. For total phosphorus, the modeled indicator (pass) and Tributary Team Characterization (poor) may not be inconsistent because they are measuring differing phosphorus source areas. It is anticipated that the Chester River Study will refine the knowledge of nutrients in the Chester River mainstem. However, it is likely the modeled nutrient estimates for the watershed will remain useful until nutrient data is available for Middle Chester River tributaries.  11   4. Toxicity In Tidal Areas In a December 2000 report produced by the Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Program Toxics 2000 Strategy, portions of the Chester River, including the Middle Chester River, were classified as an ""area of emphasis."" The Middle Chester was one of several tidal areas around the Chesapeake Bay to receive this classification based on toxic compounds found there. The Chester River's classification was based on findings of DDT, arsenic and nickel there according to the report. In general, toxic materials in the water and sediments of the Chesapeake Bay system are known to be localized and they are not homogeneously distributed bay-wide. Tidal rivers tend to serve as traps that accumulate the toxics which are residuals or by-products of human activities. The tidal rivers identified in the Toxics 2000 Strategy as areas of emphasis have high potential for toxic impacts and are showing early warning signs of contamination. The Toxics 2000 Strategy indicates that future efforts to address toxics will focus on these areas. A study of toxicity in open tidal waters and sediment in the Chester River reported varying levels of toxicity to test organisms at all four sites tested in 1996. 20 Two of the four sample sites tested were in the Middle Chester River watershed as shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations:  Near Skillet Point which is near Chestertown  Near Scotts Point down-river of Radcliffe Creek In this study, toxicity waas measured by comparing survival and growth rates of test organisms (minnows and clams). These organisms were exposed to sample-site water or sediment collected from various sites around the Chesapeake Bay under laboratory conditions. For the Chester River sites, survival was not significantly affected but growth rates were inhibited. In summary, the Skillet Point site was found to have ""high toxicity"" in both the water column and in the sediment. The Scotts Point site exhibited ""high toxicity"" in the sediment and ""low toxicity"" in the water column. These findings mean that the test organisms grew at slower rates than reference sites (relatively uncontaminated areas.) The toxicity findings at the Middle Chester sites were similar those for more urbanized rivers like the James River, VA or the Magothy River, Anne Arundel County, MD. DDT and Dieldrin were found at all four Chester River sites with the highest concentrations found at the Middle Chester River sites. The authors of the study speculated that these compounds may have contributed to their toxicity findings. Concentrations for metals were found to be generally low at the Chester River sites. However, both Middle Chester River sites had sediment concentrations above the ""Effects Range - Low"" threshold for arsenic, lead and nickel. The Skillet Point site also had sediment concentrations for mercury and zinc above this threshold. These findings suggest that the on-site concentrations of these metals could cause biological effects in some organisms.  12    Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base as summarized in the following table, there are six permitted surface water discharges and two permitted groundwater discharges in Kent County's portion of the Middle Chester River watershed. Not included in the table, but shown in Map 5 MDE Permits, are six ""general permits"" (hospital, bulk petrol, marina, farm, etc.), eight general industrial stormwater permits listed in MDE's permit data base, and five permits of various types in the Queen Anne's County portion of the Middle Chester River watershed. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE. Based on information received by the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Chestertown has agreed to upgrade its Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) with Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) technology to reduce nutrient discharge from the WWTP. This treatment technology is designed to reduce nutrients discharged during summer months when the risk of algae blooms is greatest. The greatest benefit of using BNR is reduction of total nitrogen concentration in the effluent. Control of total nitrogen in sewage effluent by other means (chemicals, etc.) is significantly more expensive in general.  14   POINT SOURCES: NPDES PERMITS and GROUDWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS Middle Chester River Watershed Facility Name NPDES Permit / MD Code MD0002232 93DP0009 MD0020010 95DP0592 MD0052671 92DP1142 MD0065731 96DP2878 MD0000345 93DP0014 MD0060585 94DP2109 94DP3117 97DP2562 Discharge Type / MDE Permit Category Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Municipal Groundwater / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Location  Chestertown Foods, Inc.

Anecdotal information on wildlife contributions, including the region's large goose population, has not been quantified. However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on two sources:  listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Middle Chester River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Chester River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations. 1. Erosion and Sediment Transport Soils in the Middle Chester River watershed are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) The experience from Urieville Lake suggests that high sediment transport has been an important factor in determining the quality of aquatic habitat within the watershed. The lake currently provides poor habitat, in part, because it is largely filled by trapped sediment. Stream habitat below the lake is relatively good because of the protective function provided by the lake. 14 The 1999 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Urieville Lake called for over 42% reduction in sediment loading rates to protect the lake.5 The intent of the TMDL is to reduce both the sediment and the phosphorus load that accompanies the sediment. Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  16   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 12 Kent County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 64 2 - 4 feet / year 12 > 4 feet / year 2  268  78  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several years in Kent County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to all large bodies of open water which are outside of the Middle Chester River watershed. The maps also show relatively little change adjacent to smaller water bodies that are typical along the Middle Chester. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS.  17    Total Maximum Daily Loads: Urieville Lake Currently, Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) work in the Middle Chester River watershed has been completed for the subwatershed draining to the Urieville Community Lake. It can be anticipated that additional TMDL work will be conducted in the Middle Chester watershed but no schedule is currently available. As new information becomes available it can be added to this Watershed Characterization. Urieville Community Lake is an extremely eutrophic water body on a DNR-owned property. The very poor water quality of the lake is associated with trapped sediment and nutrients. Water samples collected in 1993 found dissolved oxygen below 0.1 mg/l. Measurements of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in the lake indicated eutrophic conditions.13 An attempt by DNR to improve conditions in the Lake by draining and sediment removal in the middle 1990s was not successful. However, this approach proved controversial and the plan was not implemented. Currently, lake conditions remain poor.14 The June 1999 Final Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) for Urieville Community Lake verified that past / present nonpoint sources are the cause of water quality problems in the Lake. The Lake's watershed is 80% agricultural land, 18% forest and only 2% urbanized land. There are no point sources in this drainage area.5 The TMDLs for Urieville Lake are:  Phosphorus = 509 lb/yr. This represents an 85% reduction.  Sediment = ""An estimated 42.45% reduction in sediment loading rates. This translates to a sediment accumulation rate of about 24% of the storage capacity in 40 years, or an estimated load of 89.2 tons/yr. This estimated load is based on estimated ""suspended solids,"" which include organic matter, but exclude materials transported in the bed load."" Therefore, this TMDL is intended to reduce sediments from land erosion but does not address stream bank erosion.  19   LAND USE Middle Chester River Watershed Landscape Indicators Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed landscape indicators for the Middle Chester River watershed as summarized in the table below. 3 Most indicator ranking (pass / fail) is a relative measure that compares the Middle Chester River watershed with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. Landscape Indicator Impervious Surface Finding 3.7 % of watershed is impervious 0.11 people per acre 13,226 acres Rank Pass Bench Mark Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the least impervious surface. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the lower population density. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with smaller historic losses. Of 138 among highest natural watersheds in Maryland, this one is the 34 watersheds (25%) with the soil erodibility. (Soil erodibility is a condition.)  Population Density  Pass  Historic Wetland Loss Density Soil Erodibility  Pass  0.30 value per acre  Fail  NOTE: The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. The naturally erodible soils of the Middle Chester River watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. See Interpreting Landscape Indicators for additional information.  20   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 1 of 2 Impervious Surface. Reduction of impervious area can be a valuable component of a successful Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples include reduction of groundwater infiltration, soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) Population Density. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. Humans are usually very successful in competing for use of land and water. As human population increases, effects of human activity tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. Historic Wetland Loss Density. About 43% of the Middle Chester River watershed is hydric soil (about 13,000 out of 31,000 acres). The historic wetland loss estimate is based on the assumption that the hydric soils were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. These functions include habitat and nursery areas for many aquatic organisms, flood attenuation, and uptake and redistribution of nutrients, etc. In general, watersheds exhibiting greater wetland loss tend to also exhibit greater loss of the beneficial functions that wetlands provide. Strategic replacement of wetlands can significantly improve natural function in local watershed areas.  21   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 2 of 2 Unforested Stream Buffers. DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) Soil Erodibility. A finding of 0.30 means that the Middle Chester River watershed has ""high"" soil erodibility considering soils types, steep slopes and the extent of crop land within 1000 feet of waterways. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers.  22   Land Use 1997 The following table and pie chart summarize 1997 land use for the Kent County portion of the Middle Chester River Watershed. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use Map shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Additional details on land use in the Middle Chester River watershed are prodived in the Land Use Technical Report.  1997 Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed (Kent) Forest (14.43%) Wetlands (1.71%) Urban (8.31%)  Agriculture (75.54%)  1997 Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed in Kent County Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground (not graphed) Acres 22,360 4,272 2,461 506 26 29625  Watershed Total (excluding open water)  23   Land Use Projection to 2020 The Maryland Department of Planning is projecting planning estimates for population and related factors like land use to the year 2020. Based on work completed as of October 2000, the 2020 land use estimates are shown in the pie chart and in the table below. 17 Several 2020 projections are potentially important for WRAS planning in the Kent County portion of the Middle Chester River watershed as listed on the next page:  2020 Projected Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed (Kent) Forest (14.21%) Wetlands (1.71%) Urban (9.73%)  Agriculture (74.35%)  Projected Change in Land Use 1997 to 2020 Middle Chester River Watershed in Kent County Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground Acres - 356 - 67 423 no change no change  24    Urban land use is projected to increase 17% while agriculture and forest lands are projected to decrease about 1.5% each. The projected continuing loss of prime agricultural land is of particular concern.  Percentage of households served by septic system are projected to increase from 31% to 39%.  Impervious cover is projected to increase in the Radcliffe Creek subwatershed (0411) from 10% to 11%. The subwatershed encompassing the remainder of Chestertown (0413) is projected to increase from 12% to 13%. Increasing imperviousness is known to increase stress on aquatic organisms.  Kent County Department of Planning indicates that several factors may also affect land use change over the next twenty years. 22 1) Wet soil conditions tend to be prevalent in forested areas in the Middle Chester River watershed. This local condition may prevent conversion of some forested areas to urban use because new structures in rural areas will require on-site sewage treatment (passing soil percolation tests). Therefore, the County feels that additional pressure for development may be seen on agricultural lands that perk and potentially less pressure on wet forested land than the land use projection model suggests. (For more information on this issue, see Map 11 Wetlands, the wetlands section and hydric soils shown in Map 21 Wetland Restoration Opportunities.) 2) County-wide, forest land acreage has been increasing partially due to requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. These factors may affect the Middle Chester area. These projections suggest an overall trend toward increasing stress on natural systems in the watershed and particularly on aquatic life. In light of these projections, Middle Chester watershed planning could consider potential WRAS elements to help counterbalance the anticipated trends. Potential WRAS initiatives could relate to smart growth, agricultural land preservation, stream / natural area enhancement or protection, etc. The Land Use Technical Report has additional details.  25    Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment.6 Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This new funding category will be administered by Program Open Space. Based on results so far from the Chino Farms Project in Queen Anne's County, Kent County representatives have expressed interest in potential use of the Green Infrastructure concept. Map 7 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  The great majority of Kent County is in active agriculture or urban use and is therefore not identified as part of the Green Infrastructure. Other lands that may be areas of natural vegetation are not identified on the Green Infrastructure maps because they are too small to be considered of State or regional importance. However, some of these areas may be locally significant components of Green Infrastructure that should be identified for local consideration in the WRAS.  Most Green Infrastructure in Kent County is associated with water and wetlands. For example, the largest Green Infrastructure Hub in the Middle Chester River watershed, along Morgan Creek, is mostly emergent wetlands and forest associated with wetlands and hydric soil.  The corridors shown on the Green Infrastructure Map can be considered as existing or potential connections between Green Infrastructure hubs. Significant portions of the mapped corridors are in agricultural use. The large areas that lack natural vegetation tend to limit the corridor's contribution to the Green Infrastructure network. The Middle Chester WRAS could potentially assess enhancement, expansion, or protection of the Green Infrastructure hubs and corridors. 27    Natural Resource Areas at the Watershed Scale The Green Infrastructure scenario described here, due to its Statewide or regional focus, may not identify natural resource areas that are locally significant. It is reasonable to employ GIS information at the watershed scale to help identify natural areas of potential local significance. Map 8 Natural Resource Areas of Potential Local Significance suggests numerous areas that may have local natural resource importance. This GIS map (and similar scenarios) can be used to assist in prioritizing areas for further assessment and to help clarify local interests and needs for locally important natural resource areas.  29    Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The following listing and Map 9 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Most land in the watershed is privately owned. Promoting opportunities available for private land owners to protect rural, agricultural and similar land values may be valuable in the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives, communicating opportunities for agricultural easements was raised as an interest.  Local / County parks are concentrated in one large area at the northwest edge of the watershed or are small parcels geared to local recreational interests around Chestertown.  DNR land is limited to a small acreage at the Urieville Community Lake.  Land protected with the intent of continued agricultural use is concentrated on several farms northeast of Chestertown.  Conservation easements are concentrated in two areas south and west of Chestertown. In drafting the WRAS for the Middle Chester River in Kent County, existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors to WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  31   Smart Growth Within Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Primary Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 9 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Rural Legacy Areas in the Middle Chester. Two small areas at the edge of the Middle Chester watershed up stream of Urieville Lake are part of a much larger Rural Legacy Area immediately outside of the watershed to the north. Expansion of protected land through this program could be incorporated as a component of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. - Priority Funding Areas in the Middle Chester. About six areas in the Middle Chester watershed are designated Priority Funding Areas. The majority of the acreage is concentrated in and around Chestertown and Worton. In Priority Funding Areas, new development and/or redevelopment may be anticipated. Planning for watershed restoration projects in Priority Funding Areas, or downstream of them, needs to account for potential changing conditions during the life of the project. For example, increasing impervious area may alter stormwater conditions that a watershed restoration project will have to adequately address.  32    Soils of the Middle Chester River Watershed 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Kent County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Natural Soils Groups In Map 10 Soils and the pie chart, prime Middle Chester (Kent Co.) farmland is depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching. Over 75% of the Middle Chester (0.53%) River Watershed in Kent County is prime (11.65%) (0.66%) farmland. (7.08%) The green and bluegreen areas are soils (2.37%) with wetness conditions that limit their (1.24%) (48.47%) agricultural or development potential. These soils are concentrated along the Middle Chester River and its tributaries Morgan Creek and (27.73%) Radcliffe Creek. Nearly 20% of the watershed (0.27%) exhibit wetness-related limitations. Also concentrated along local waterways are soils on slopes between 8% to 15% and soils that are excessively well drained. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations related to wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development. Land owners in the watershed have tended to leave many of these areas in natural vegetation or other low intensity use. By comparing Map 10 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it is apparent marginal soils and current areas of natural habitat tend to coincide:  Map 6 1997 General Land Use  Map 7 Green Infrastructure  Map 8 Natural Resource Areas of Potential Local Significance Natural Soils Groups or similar soils assessment techniques can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  34    Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26 The Eastern Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high groundwater table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant on the Eastern Shore but are represented in the Middle Chester River watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.)  36   2. Tracking Wetlands 26 Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have been minor in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change Middle Chester River Watershed Permits Authorized = 3 Letters of Authorization Issued = 11 Wetland Class Acres Permanent Impacts -0.36 Mitigation by Permittee 0 Other Gains (Regulatory) 8.69 Programmatic Gains 0 Net Gain/Loss 8.33 Note: Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Middle Chester River watershed tend to occur along waterways as shown in Map 11 Wetlands. In comparing the wetlands map to Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use, it can be seen that much of the forested land in the watershed is found in association with wetlands or adjacent to them. A comparison of the two maps shows that Wetland Acreage Summary many of the nontidal Middle Chester River Watershed 26 wetland areas are Wetland Class Acres depicted as forest on the Estuarine, Intertidal (E2) aquatic bed 0 land use map.

See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion. significant for watershed management. From a land use perspective, 506 acres of wetlands are identified by the Maryland Department of Planning. From a habitat / regulatory perspective, there are approximately 16,816 acres of wetlands in the watershed. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  38    LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Middle Chester River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  40   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Middle Chester River Watershed.3 Compared to other watersheds in Maryland, the Middle Chester watershed exhibits poor conditions for submerged aquatic vegetation and for bottomdwelling organisms in nontidal streams. Living Resource Indicator SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Index Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Score 1.00 3.00 3.59 Rank Fail Fail Fail Bench Mark (percent based on 138 watersheds) Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score of 1 yields a rank of ""fail"" Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score less than 7 yields a rank of ""fail"" Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score less than 6 yields a rank of ""fail"" Streams scoring less than 6 were designated Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. Streams scoring greater than or equal to 8 were designated Category 3 watersheds in need of protection. Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""fail"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. The top 34 (25%) were designated as Category 3 watersheds in need of protection.  7.50  Pass  Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  3.89  Pass  Also see Interpreting Living Resource Indicators.  41   Interpreting Living Resource Indicators General. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS: SAV Abundance Index. The Finding of ""1.0"" means that SAV in 1996 covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This index allows comparison of watersheds based on the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) actual/potential SAV area. To generate the number under Finding, the watershed area covered by SAV in a single year is measured using aerial survey data. The year used here was 1996. The potential SAV area, as determined by water depth, physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV, includes water area up to two feet deep. (This is the Tier III SAV restoration goal.) SAV Habitat Index. An index less than 7 means that, based on available data from 1994 through 1996, habitat conditions for SAV are less than favorable. This index allows comparison of watersheds based on how well SAV habitat requirements are attained. To create this index, five measurements of habitat conditions are considered (secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Chorophyll a and total suspended solids.) Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. This index allows comparison of streams based on the populations of bottom-dwelling ""bugs"" (benthic macroinvertebrate organisms) found in the stream. For coastal plain streams, this index employs seven measurements of these populations which is translated into a rank for each sampling site. An index less than 6 indicates that benthic organisms are significantly stressed by local conditions. Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity. An index less than 6 indicates that improvements would be beneficial to fish populations. This index allows comparison of selected streams (first through third order nontidal streams) based on fish community health. In each sampling site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. An index of 8 or greater indicates conditions favorable for fish. Non-Tidal In-Stream Habitat Index. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  42   Fish 1. Tidal Areas Sampling at ten stations in the Chester River was conducted monthly from July through September for the years 1995 through 2000. Findings from at least four to six of these stations will be relevant to the Middle Chester River watershed. The locations of these stations are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Stations. Sampling was accomplished using beach seines and trawls. Results of this effort will be reported in the DNR Chester River Study anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. 19 2. Nontidal Areas In 1995, two sites were sampled during a Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) project on two nontidal streams that flow into the Urieville Community Lake. For these two sampling sites, the Fish Index of Biotic Integrity was considered ""fair"" for the Unnamed Fish Species Upstream of Urieville Lake, 1995 Tributary and ""good"" for the Upper Left Unnamed Upper Left Fork. 4 Also see Map 4 Monitoring Species Tributary Fork Stations for the approximate site locations. least brook lamprey X The two tributaries to Urieville American eel X X Community Lake described here are eastern mud minnow X X only a partial representation of Middle Chester watershed conditions. golden minnow X Availability of additional information in creek chubsucker X X the DNR fisheries database has not been confirmed at this time.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macroinvertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  44   1. Benthos in Nontidal Streams The most recent assessment of ""bugs"" living in streams (benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos) in Middle Chester River stream was conducted in early 2001 by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division. It is anticipated that results will be available in June 2001. Additional monitoring by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) is scheduled for the Chester River Basin to assess the instream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.) 10 In the 1990s, living resources including benthos were assessed at four Middle Chester River watershed sites shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations. In 1995, the first round of the MBSS included two sites in the Middle Chester River watershed. This assessment addressed the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions summarized in the 1995 MBSS Findings Table . The living resources and habitat at the two sites are significantly different even though both sites are in close proximity to each other upstream of Urieville Lake. In 1992 and 1993, benthic organisms and their habitat were assessed at numerous sites in the Chester River basin. 21 One site was on Radcliffe Creek near the Route 20 crossing. Habitat quality there was ranked as the worst of the 25 sites assessed in the Chester River Basin and it was categorized as ""non-supporting"" of benthos. However, assessment of the Radcliffe Creek / Route 20 site based on the benthic macroinvertebrate community found the site to be ""moderately impaired."" Recommendations that accompanied these findings suggested that elevated nitrogen concentrations may have been a contributing factor in promoting benthos community conditions despite poor habitat conditions. The second Middle Chester site was on Morgan Creek near the Perkins Hill Road crossing. Habitat quality and habitat condition were ranked as ""partially supporting"" benthos. This finding is better than the Radcliffe Creek site but it is still impaired. The assessment of the Morgan Creek / Perkins Hill Road site based on the benthic macroinvertebrate community found the site to be ""moderately impaired,"" comparable to that found at Radcliffe Creek. 2. Benthos in Tidal Areas Sampling of benthic (bottom dwelling) organisms was conducted in the Chester River between 1995 and 1998. In 1995 and 1996, samples were collected at ten mainstem stations as shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations. In 1997 and 1998, samples were collected at 30 stations. Results of this effort will be reported in the DNR Chester River Study anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. 19  45   1995 MBSS Findings * Middle Chester River Watershed In Kent County Station # KE-...-95 N-128-122 N-018-216 Stream Location Upstream of Ur Upstream of Ur Fish Score 4.0 3 Description Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Condition Good Fair Benthos Score 1.57 3 Condition Very Poor Fair Physical Habitat Score 24.67 66.87 Condition Poor Fair  Index Used In 1995 MBSS Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Benthic Index Biotic Integrity Physical Habitat Index *       Additional details are available at www.dnr.state.md.us .

Historic information gathered in a survey conducted between 1906 to 1912 indicates that oyster beds were once located in areas farther upstream than their current locations but none were so far upstream as the Middle Chester.16  Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants, animals and ecological communities of those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program.  47   1. Habitat Protection Categories One way to characterize a watershed for sensitive species is to identify known habitat locations using several broad categories employed by DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division. These categories are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Categories. More details and guidance can be requested from Division staff. Two of the three categories used to help protect sensitive species during review of applications for a State permit or approval or involve State funds are found in the Middle Chester River Watershed as shown in Map 12 Sensitive Species. For projects potentially affecting these areas, the State permit or approval will include recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their permit review process. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Morgan Creek Wetlands of Special State Concern The Morgan Creek Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) is a diverse swamp forest containing dense alder thickets and emergent marshes, bordered by an upland mixed hardwood-pine forest. A population of rare plant species classified as ""State Rare"" grows in the creek banks of this swamp forest. 24 This 75-acre WSSC is shown in Map 12 Sensitive Species. 3. Rare Fish and Mussels DNR recently initiated a project to rank watersheds across Maryland to aid in targeting conservation and restoration efforts to benefit known populations of rare fish and mussels. In comparison to the more than 1000 small (12-digit) watersheds identified by DNR in Maryland, several of the 12-digit sub-watersheds in Kent County's Middle Chester River watershed ranked ""moderately high"" and the remainder ranked ""neutral."" The Sensitive Species Map shows the distribution of the ranking. Map 12 Sensitive Species shows the rare fish and mussels ranking. In general, higher ranking suggests that restoration or conservation projects in these areas may have greater potential to protect aquatic species diversity. Projects could be used to protect, enhance or expand existing aquatic habitat. A ranking of neutral indicates that information is insufficient (rather than these species are absent or that the area is low priority.) Neutral areas upstream of higher ranked areas are potentially important because they affect rare fish and mussel populations located downstream. In neutral ranked areas, it is reasonable to rely on other available criteria for targeting watershed conservation and restoration projects. This ranking considers information from 1970 to 1997 only for rare species of fish or mussels being tracked in Maryland. Four possible ranks were used for this project: Very High, High, Moderately High and Neutral. Each rare species being tracked contributed to this ranking based on two types of criteria: 1) presence or absence, and 2) if present, weighting relative rarity on worldwide and Statewide scales. 48   Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Categories Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least five SSPRAs are identified in the Middle Chester River watershed. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelop identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. At least one SSPRA compasses each NHA and WSSC. Also see Map 12 Sensitive Species. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) One WSSC is designated in the Middle Chester River watershed -- the Morgan Creek Wetlands. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  No NHAs are located in the Middle Chester River watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA.  49    Submerged Aquatic Vegetation  8  The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is important not only as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. 1. Criteria for Tracking SAV The Chesapeake Bay Program has developed new criteria for determining SAV habitat suitability of an area based on water quality. The measurement called ""Percent Light at Leaf"" assesses the amount of available light reaching the leaf surface of SAV after being reduced in the water column and by epiphytic growth on the leaves themselves. The document describing this new model measuring SAV habitat suitability is found on the Chesapeake Bay Program website (www.chesapeakebay.net/pubs/sav/index.html). The older ""Habitat Requirements"" of five water quality parameters are still used for diagnostic purposes. Re-establishment of SAV is measured against the ""Tier 1 Goal"", an effort to restore SAV to any areas known to contain SAV from 1971 to 1990. (Also see the Executive Summary SAV Requirements for additional information.) 2. Middle Chester SAV Status According to at least one time-time local resident, SAV beds did occur in the vicinity of Chestertown in the 1950s and/or 1960s.29 Since 1979 when the Chesapeake Bay-wide aerial mapping program began, SAV has never been sighted by in the Middle Chester River or other tidal fresh and low salinity (oligohaline) areas of the Chester River. However, this area has never been ground-truthed to determine if SAV beds too small to be seen in the aerial photographs may be undetected. To due the absence of SAV, a Tier 1 Goal for SAV restoration has not been established for this portion of Chester River. (Also see www.vims.edu/bio/sav/ for extensive information or www.mdmerlin.net for annual distribution maps 1984 through 1996). 3. Comparing the Middle Chester to Nearby Areas A comparison of SAV in the Middle Chester River watershed to other nearby areas is shown in Map 13 SAV Habitat Requirement Status and Map 14 SAV Distribution. Water quality data for the low salinity (oligohaline) region including much of the Middle Chester River has not been available. Up stream of the Middle Chester, data for the tidal fresh area near Route 290 Crumpton Road (monitoring station ET4.1) indicate that only phosphorous levels meet the SAV habitat requirements, while four other criteria fail: percent light at leaf, light attenuation, suspended solids and algae concentrations. ( Nitrogen is not applicable in low salinity areas.) Down stream of the Middle Chester River, in the moderate salinity (mesohaline) portion of Chester River, SAV coverage has been highly variable since 1984, ranging from a low of 80 acres in 51   1990 to a high of 1,181 acres in 1998 (www.vims.edu/bio/sav/). The 1999 coverage was 736 acres or 20% of the Tier I goal (3,751 acres). On the Kent County side of the river, SAV beds fringe much of Langford, Greys Inn, and Church Creeks, and Eastern Neck Narrows and many of the coves around Eastern Neck Island. On the Queen Anne's County side, the largest beds are found from Macum Creek (Kent Island) extending up to and including Queenstown Creek. Ground-truthing by citizens (and the Chester River Association) and staff from Maryland DNR, Patuxent River Wildlife Center, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Environmental Protection Agency has found, in order of most frequently reported, redhead grass, milfoil, elodea, widgeon grass, sago pondweed, horned pondweed, wild celery and naiads. Water quality monitoring data from the station located between the southern tip of Eastern Neck Island and Kent Narrows indicate that percent light at leaf, suspended solids and phosphorous level meet the SAV habitat requirements, while light attenuation and levels of nitrogen and algae are borderline. 4. SAV Restoration Potential 26 For a comparison of the Middle Chester to all other tidal segments in the Chesapeake Bay see the technical report Executive Summary SAV Requirements. The last page includes a map indicating that the Middle Chester area (oligohaline portion of the Chester River), ranked the worst compared to other segments based on failure to meet SAV requirements during the period 1992 to 1997. This finding suggests that water quality improvements are necessary in the Middle Chester mainstem to allow for eventual restoration of SAV.  52     RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2000/2001 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Kent County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Middle Chester River watershed during Winter 2000/2001. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives, several interests for stream assessment were identified:  Potential priorities for stream assessment were for 1) Radcliffe Creek, 2) Morgan Creek and 3) other waterways in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Identifying stream blockages to fish movement  Identifying railroad drainage problems at stream crossings A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in Summer 2001 with a final report by December 2001. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy.  55   Agricultural Conservation Programs Kent County has one of the highest levels of conservation participation in the state. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Kent Soil and Water Conservation District (KSWCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Last year 54 plans were developed for 8,665 acres, 67 plans for 13,246 acres were revised, and 273 individual BMPs were installed. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Kent SWCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers.  Clean Marinas Program Overboard discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biological oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the six marinas located in the Middle Chester River vicinity offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 15 Fish Blockages and Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is voluntary way for marina owners to demonstrate that their pumpout service and other high quality boating services provided in accordance with Program guidelines are helping keep local waters cleaner. Kent County representatives have expressed interest in exploring overboard discharge and clean marina related issues. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  56   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Middle Chester River watershed appears in the Fish Blockages Table and Map 15 Fish Blockages and Marinas. Of the 24 blockages listed in Kent County's portion of the Middle Chester River watershed, none are known to have been corrected. The same is true of the four blockages listed in the Queen Anne's County portion of the watershed. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for initiating a thorough Stream Corridor Assessment. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. In general, removal of fish blockages is recommended if they would open a large stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. Most of the blockages on the map appear to be relatively near the headwaters of the streams they affect. However, several known blockages on the map that are relatively near the Chester River appear to be blocking significant stretches of stream. Based on this limited information, the following priority suggestions are offered for consideration:  High priority: For blockages nearest to the Chester River, perform stream corridor assessments to verify potential benefit of removal.  Mid Priority: For all other blockages, perform stream corridor assessments. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of farm ponds, drainage ditches, etc. If a blockage is found to be in this category, circumstances like requirements for drainage control function and public or land owner needs are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  57   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Middle Chester River Watershed Page 1 0f 2 Radcliffe Creek and Other Subwatersheds Except Morgan Creek Station Radcliffe Creek CH028 CH085 CH086 CH087 CH084 CH089 CH090 CH018 CH036 CH088 CH091 Blockage Corrected Co KE KE KE KE KE KE KE QA QA QA QA Stream Radcliffe Creek Radcliffe Creek trib to Radcliffe Creek trib to Radcliffe Creek trib to Chester River trib to Chester River trib to Chester River Hambleton Creek Rosin Creek trib to Chester River trib to Rosin Creek below Mary Morris Road Route 289 0.4 miles below Route 291 Route 291 above Route 213 0.5 miles above Route 544 south of Route 213 at Truslow Road south of Round Top Road Name / Location below Mary Morris Road  Queen Annes County  Chester River  58   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Middle Chester River Watershed Page 2 of 2 Morgan Creek Subwatershed Station CH024 CH025 CH092 CH093 CH094 CH095 CH096 CH097 CH098 CH100 CH101 CH102 CH103 CH104 CH105 CH106 CH107 Blockage Corrected Co KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE Stream Morgan Creek Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek Southeast Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek Name / Location weir 1.0 mile above Perkins Hill Road 0.2 miles below Brownstown Blacks Rd 0.2 miles below Route 213 0.3 miles below Route 213 near Route 561 0.2 miles below Route 297 0.4 miles below Worton 0.2 miles east of Route 213 at Rt. 561 0.5 miles west of Perkins Hill Road RR crossing near headwaters 0.1 mile east of Route 448 0.3 mile east of Route 448 upstream of Perkins Hill Road below Kenndeyville Road below Kennedyville Road above Route 448  59    Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffers planted and prioritizing them for restoration is often a time-consuming and expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS-based tools to assist in the buffer restoration targeting process. With these tools, GIS maps and other information can be generated to help select stream segments for additional Stream Corridor Assessment, to identify geographic areas for community and land owner contact and for similar uses. Then, with an appropriate level of on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" these GIS tools can provide an efficient first step toward stream buffer restoration. In preliminary discussion, Kent County Representatives expressed interest in exploring the potential for targeting available funds through several programs like CRP and CREP. One tool that could be used for this targeting is prioritization of stream buffer restoration. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The 61   streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. By identifying land uses in riparian areas with inadequate Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates By Land Use stream buffers, like crop land Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model, in kg/ha-yr adjacent to streams, the potential to reduce nutrient and sediment Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment loads can be improved. To assist Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 in finding areas with crop land Urban Impervious 8.43 0.58 0.00 adjacent to streams, the same Pervious 10.79 1.56 0.20 land use data shown in Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use can Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 be filtered using GIS. The new Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 scenario shown in Map 16 Land Use Scenario for Stream Buffer Restoration focuses on the land use within 150 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 62   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Middle Chester River, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offer greater potential for habitat. Map 17 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the Middle Chester River watershed. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. A refinement of the above scenario is shown in Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland . The presentation in Map 18 is based on the same analysis as Map 17 except that only cropland is shown so that these areas are easier to see. 6. Wetland Associations Wetlands and adjacent natural uplands form complex habitats that offer a range of habitat opportunities for many species. These ""habitat complexes"" tend to offer greater species diversity and other ecological values that are greater than the values that the wetland or uplands could offer independently. Therefore, restoring stream buffers adjacent to or near existing wetlands tends to offer greater habitat benefits than the restoration project could otherwise produce. Map 19 Wetland Proximity Scenario identifies unforested buffer zones that are in close proximity (within 300 feet) to wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory). Restoration projects in these areas may offer opportunities to enhance and expand wetland habitat in addition to providing other desirable buffer functions.  63   7. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects can take into account many different potential benefits. Several of these scenarios are presented independently in this section. However, site selection and project design generally incorporate numerous factors to optimize benefits from the project. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Two of the many ways to integrate targeting criteria to help identify candidate sites for additional investigation are shown here. One example is shown on Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland Scenario . This map suggests potential stream buffer restoration areas that are likely to offer the greatest opportunity to reduce both nutrients and sediment entering the stream. Another example shown in Map 20 Prioritizing Streams Scenario prioritizes stream segments based on lack of adequate naturally vegetated buffers, land use adjacent to the stream and headwater stream status.  Targeting To Achieve Measurable Water Quality Improvement Selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Middle Chester River watershed, available water quality data reinforces the premise targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. For example, water clarity data for the Chester River shows that the problem extends up river. The data also suggest that origins of the problem are great in magnitude and are in part outside of the Middle Chester River watershed. If restoration projects are targeted to selected Middle Chester tributaries, improvement in instream water quality may be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  64        Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives several potential interests involving wetland restoration were identified:  Creation of habitat or wetlands based on stream data  Exploring assistance to landowners who participate / contribute to wetland restoration.  Eradication of the invasive plant Phragmites: outreach/newsletter For the Middle Chester River watershed, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 21 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are around 100 sites that fit the following criteria: 1) hydric soil, 2) on open land, and 3) within 300 feet of existing wetlands. In this scenario, opportunities on public land are suggested as high priority for investigation because their small number and relatively simple land owner issues would allow rapid assessment of viability. The much greater number of potential sites on private land will require additional screening based on land owner interests.  70    Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland shows numerous potential stream buffer restoration sites that may offer wetland restoration opportunities considering: 1) hydric soils, 2) on open land / agricultural fields, 3) adjacent to streams, and 4) potential to address nutrients in groundwater based on soil type. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership, etc. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  71    PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" has two projects in the Middle Chester River watershed: 1- Agriculture Soil Conservation Water Quality Planning for the Upper & Middle Chester River watersheds. (319 funding for years 1999 and 2000, Coastal Zone Management funding for year 2001.) 2- Tracking Tributary Strategy Results with Volunteer Water Quality Monitors within the Chester River watershed. (319 funding for year 1997.)  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway Program This transportation-related program may offer opportunities for stream restoration at road crossings. 2. Chester River Association The Chester River Association is private volunteer organization. In 1988, the Association sponsored a workshop facilitated by the National Park Service Mid-Atlantic Region. The workshop afforded an opportunity for the local community to express interests and concerns related to the Chester River watershed. A broad spectrum of issues and potential actions were documented.15 3. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers rental payments over a 10 year 73   period on a per acre basis to remove highly erodible land and other sensitive land/fields from production. One of numerous benefits from the program is reduction of sediment and nutrient movement into streams. 4. Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program The Conservation and Restoration Enhancement Program (CREP) program pays farmers and land owners on a per acre basis to remove from agricultural production environmentally sensitive land that is located near water bodies. This program creates new or enhanced stream buffers, restores wetlands, converts highly erodible ground to protective cover and creates wildlife habitat. Landowners also have the option to place their CREP ground under a conservation easement. 5. Environmental Quality Incentive Program The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) offers financial assistance to farmers to install conservation practices related to local watershed concerns. The Middle and Upper Chester River watersheds in Kent County have been designated as a Geographic Priority Area which entitles the area to receive a annual funding under the program. These funds are used to provide financial assistance to farmers who are implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will reduce three kinds of water quality problems:  nutrient loadings in surface and groundwater  sediment reaching surface water and  pesticide contamination of surface and groundwater. 6. Forest Service Integrated Service Delivery Project The current State Forest Service project to improve service delivery could also offer opportunities to promote stream buffer restoration. 7. Greenways The Year 2000 edition of the Maryland Greenways Atlas identifies Greenway and Green Infrastructure projects and issues important to Kent County and the Middle Chester River watershed. 8. Wetland Restoration Projects Ducks Unlimited, Inc. has a project to create a shallow water wetland habitat that could serve as an example for additional work  74   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Middle Chester River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 3:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  75   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Sources Used for the Characterization 1. DNR.

The Town of La Veta's wastewater treatment facility utilizes a partially aerated lagoon system followed by a constructed wetlands system to treat influent wastewater. The Town's treatment facility utilizes the following treatment components and unit processes: influent flow measurement, lagoon system consisting of one mechanically aerated cell and two stabilization cells, wetland system consisting of two cells, chlorination, dechlorination using sulfur dioxide, effluent flow measurement and a continuous effluent flow measuring device.  Lagoons The La Veta lagoon system consist of one aerated cell and two stabilization cells. The aerators are operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the winter and 8 hours a day during the rest of the year. Some features of this lagoon system are detailed in the table below.  La Veta  Page 1   La Veta  Lagoon Information Cell No.: Surface Area (sq. ft.) Avg. Depth (ft) Avg.

The 1992 expansion and modification of the original treatment facility was brought about as a result of the original treatment facility being overloaded, its inability to produce an effluent which could consistently comply with the facility's discharge permit limitations and the need to provide additional treatment capacity to accommodate projected growth in the service area.  Energy Analysis The wastewater flows through the system by gravity. Energy is consumed in the aerated lagoons by submersible 3hp pumps. During the winter months these pumps run 24 hours a day. The rest of the year, the pumps are operated 8 hours, during the night. A typical energy bill is about $450 a month.  Construction Costs This wetland system cost approximately $365,000 to construct. Since it was established in an abandoned lagoon, earthwork was minimized.  Wetland Design Design Methods The design of the wetland system is based on BOD5 removal using the first order, plug flow, reaction kinetics model developed by Reed, Middlebrooks and Crites. It is assumed that the bulk of settleable solids will be removed in the lagoon system, therefore; influent BOD5 will be primarily soluble BOD and floatable or suspended algal material. A water balance was done to determine the typical wetland hydraulic loading rate. The required water depth for a hydraulic residence time of 11.9 days in the winter and 5 days in the summer will be an operating depth of 6"" to 12"", with the maximum depth kept to less than 24"".  Objectives The main objective of the wetland cells is to remove TSS due to algal carryover from the lagoons.  La Veta  Page 2   La Veta Size The wetland system is a surface flow system consisting of two cells. The total area of the wetland system is 69,400 square feet (1.6 acres).  Shape As shown by the schematic, the sedimentation forebay is rectangular and the wetland cells are rectangular with a direct flow path. The wetland cells are constructed within the embankments of an abandoned lagoon.  Hydraulics Each wetland cell is equipped with its own influent and effluent flow system. A timber wall equipped with a longitudinal weir plant at its top, runs along the width of each wetland. This structure provides uniform flow into the wetlands. Both wetland cells can be bypassed, or one cell can be taken offline for maintenance. The water flow to each wetland is controlled by adjustment of the weir plates installed in the influent control structure. Flow depth in the wetland cells can be adjusted by installing stop planks at the effluent end of each cell. During normal summer months, the depth in the cells operates in the range of 6 to 12 inches. During the winter, the flow is maintained 4 to 6 inches under the ice cover. The effluent end of each wetland cell consists of timber walls with semi-circular corrugated metal pipe fitted in open sections. Outlet pipes are located outside the timber walls. Each outlet pipe is equipped with a perforated cap and buried in river rock.

Data reflect the quality of the effluent, not influent measurements are taken for these parameters. The pH values plotted are an average of the minimum and maximum 30-day values that are reported in the monthly reports. Previous to the wetland implementation, data indicate that average pH values in the effluent were close to the maximum daily allowable of 11. An amendment to the discharge permit changed the maximum pH limitation from 9.0su to 11.0 s.u. La Veta was eligible for this amendment because it met both applicable requirements, 1) no inorganic chemical could be added to the wastestream, and 2) contributions from industrial sources do not cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 6.0 s.u. or greater than 9.0 s.u. It was determined that the high pH in the system was due to significant algae bloom in the lagoons. A chlorination-dechlorination system is provided as a part of the treatment to meet the fecal coliform permit limitations. This system has not been used in the last 5 years because effluent quality has been suitable for discharge without their use.

The wetland discharges to the Cuchares River. The LaVeta treatment wetlands are located in the broad valley of the Cucharas River, at the base of a pion pine-dominated bluff.  Cell Vegetation Two cells are present at the LaVeta site. Cell 1 is composed of 80 percent water, 10 percent litter, and 10 percent vegetation. The vegetation communities for cells 1 and 2 are identical. Community 1, which composes 90 percent of each wetland cell, is dominated by cattail (Typha latifolia), with Scirpus americanus and duckweed (Lemna minor) present but not dominant. Vegetation community 2, which composes the remaining 10 percent, is dominated by cattail, softstem bulrush (Scirpus tabernamontanae) with duckweed, willowherb (Epilobeum ciliata), creeping spikerush (Eleocharis palustris), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum)and sandbar willow (Salix exigua) present but not dominant. The site is dominated by 95 percent water and 5 percent vegetation.  Planting/Seeding Cattails were planted at the site in the fall. The planting rate is not known..  Weeds Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), mullein (Verbascum thapsus), and gumweed (Grindelia squarosa) are present around ponds and wetlands in both cells. Canada thistle and mullein are on the State Noxious Weed list. They are invasive in areas of recent disturbance, and spread quickly. They also prevent the establishment of native species and have low wildlife value.  Maintenance Issues No maintenance items were noted.  Wildlife The LaVeta wetland provides habitat for muskrat, beaver, red winged black birds, waterfowl, and geese. Mallards and herons were observed during the site visit. This wetland has structural diversity in the form of small patches of open water interspersed with cattail stands. From a landscape perspective, it provides valuable wildlife habitat. There are no other similar wetland/open water complexes in the area, and the treatment facility gains extra value because of its location between the Cucharas River floodplain and the pion bluff.  Wetland Biodiversity Functional Assessment Sediment/nutrient/toxicant removal and production export/food chain support both rated high. General wildlife habitat rated moderate. Habitat diversity and uniqueness of the constructed wetland rated moderate to low. This wetland received 45 percent of the total possible functional points. It rated as a category III wetland.

Two Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the WRAS project area are State-identified priorities for restoration: Bush River and Bynum Run. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 119,600 acres including about 10,845 acres of open water. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the County to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Five of the six Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin are identified in the State's 303(d) list for not supporting their designated use. The causes appear to be related to four general categories of water quality problems: 1) nutrients in tidal waters and lakes, 2) suspended sediment in both tidal and nontidal waters, 3) toxics substances found near Aberdeen Proving Ground, and; 4) biological limitations identified in specific nontidal stream segments. As one step toward remedying these problems, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) projects will be conducted over the next several years. TMDLs for nitrogen and phosphorus have been established for Swan Creek. During the years 1985 to 2000, one long term monitoring station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River shows trends for two parameters -- long term measurements for both total phosphorus and algae abundance suggest a worsening of conditions. All other long term water quality measurements at this station show no significant trend (total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and water clarity as measured by secchi disk). Land Use Land in the Bush River Basin has significant concentrations of development. Overall, the River Basin is about 35% developed. The most developed 8-digit watershed is Bynum Run (53% developed) and the least developed is Bush River (nearly 25%). Agriculture is a significant land use across the Bush River Basin except for Aberdeen Proving Ground. Agricultural land use involved 16 to 40% of the land in the other 8-digit watersheds. Overall, forest land covers more than one third of the Bush River Basin. Large concentrations of forest are found in the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Bush River watersheds. Relatively little remains in the Bynum Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds (about 23 and 28% respectively). Wetlands cover large acreage of Aberdeen Proving Ground (about 16%) and significant acreage in the Bush River 8-digit watershed (over 7%). Compared to other Bush River Basin watersheds, Bynum Run watershed has the highest percent developed land and greatest extent of land identified for Smart Growth in a Priority Funding Area. It also has the least protected land and forest interior. viii Sept. 2002   Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Chesapeake Bay is considered to be very important for fish spawning and nursery. Estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the overall productivity of the area but specific information on Bush River Basin fisheries is not available. In nontidal streams, about half of the fish populations assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) were rated as good and most of remainder were rated fair or poor. MBSS sites rated as very poor were all within the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed. Fish consumption advisories have been issued for two tidal fish species (channel catfish and white perch) due to PCBs and pesticides and for some species commonly taken from lakes due to methyl-mercury. In nontidal streams, benthic populations assessed by the MBSS across the Bush River Basin were commonly rated fair or poor. Locations assessed by MBSS as good were all found in the Swan Creek watershed. In the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, most areas assessed were rated as very poor. Sensitive species areas identified for project review purposes are found in all of the 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin. However, Wetlands of Special State Concern, which are subject to regulatory review requirements for sensitive species, are concentrated in a few areas: Bush River Watershed (Otter Point Creek, North of Sod Run, Church Creek), Atkisson Reservoir, and Swan Creek watershed (Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area, Swan Harbor Farm Park). Habitat for the Federally Endangered Maryland Darter is located in the Swan Creek watershed (Gashey's Run). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations in the Bush River are very sparse compared to the potential physical habitat. The factors inhibiting SAV locally are believed to be associated with poor light penetration, elevated algal populations, nutrients and suspended solids. Restoration Targeting Tools Otter Point Creek in the Bush River watershed is designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve. This designation provides for protection of over 900 acres of water, wetlands and uplands. The designation has also fostered long term efforts for estuarine research, monitoring and education relating to the local estuary. DNR conducted a stream corridor assessment on Church Creek in 2002. This information augments earlier work by DNR on Bynum Run and Swan Creek and by Harford County in other Bush River Basin watesheds. These surveys identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion and other measures of stream condition. This information provides a ground-truthed foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. For example, one GIS scenario suggests that opportunities for stream buffer restoration targeted to areas of poorly drained hydric soils to maximize nutrient uptake may be found upstream of Bel Air and in several headwater streams in the Bush River watershed.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Harford County Director of Department of Public Works Department of Public Works, Water Resources Engineering Department of Public Works, Water and Sewer Department of Planning and Zoning Department of Parks and Recreation Health Department Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Coastal Zone Management Division Watershed Restoration Division Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Fisheries Service Resource Assessment Service Upper Western Shore Tributary Team Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army Environmental Center Maryland Department of Agriculture Maryland Department of the Environment Maryland Department of Planning  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Department of the Natural Resources  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Harford County is one of five Counties participating in the second round of the WRAS program.

Swan Creek is not part of the County's WRAS project area included to allow comparison of subwatersheds across the entire Bush River Basin.  Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information 1 Sept. 2002    identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2  Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) was applied to three subwatersheds in the Bush River basin as shown in Map 4 Category 1 Priority Watersheds: - Bush River, watershed 02130701 - Bynum Run, watershed 02130704 - Swan Creek, watershed 02130706 (outside of the WRAS project area) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization.  Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 5 Designated Uses shows the distribution of designated uses across the Bush River Basin. In the simplified summary below, designated uses requiring the better water quality are listed first and the least restrictive (Use I) is listed last. In general, Use I water quality requirements apply everywhere unless superceded by criteria necessary for other designated uses. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 3 - Use III Natural Trout Waters: Bynum Run and all tributaries - Use IV-P Recreational Trout Waters and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries - Use II Shellfish Harvesting: All estuarine portions of tributaries except: (a) Bush River and tributaries above a line from Fairview Pt. to Chillbury Pt. (b) Romney Creek above Briar Point (c) Swan Creek and tributaries above mouth - Use I-P Water Contact Recreation, Protection of Aquatic Life and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries, including Atkisson Reservoir from Otter Point Creek to upstream boundary of Atkisson Reservoir. - Use I Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All water bodies not otherwise designated above. 3 Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings The table 303(d) List of Impaired Waters shows that there are 13 listings within the Bush River Basin. These listings mean that pollution associated with nutrients, suspended sediment and/or toxic materials are preventing full use of these waters based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal for a WRAS could be elimination of 303(d) listings for the watershed and/or mitigation of the causes contributing to the listings. Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions As shown in Map 5 Designated Uses, a large portion of the Bush River are designated for shellfish harvesting. However, the entire area shown as Use II waters for shellfish harvesting on the map is ""restricted."" This restriction applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" Use II (shellfish harvesting waters in this basin are technically restricted because only minimal monitoring is being done due to the lack of a commercially harvestable resource.26 There are relatively few oysters in the Bush River because it typically has less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity but oysters grow best in water with greater than 12 ppt. Consequently, the State's shellfish area monitoring efforts are not invested in low salinity areas like the Bush River where oysters can not be commercially harvested. In the absence of regular monitoring, the restriction is necessary to protect human health because oysters and clams are filter feeders that are readily contaminated by even brief or intermittent exposure to animal and human waste.  4  Sept. 2002   303(d) List of Impaired Waters for the Bush River Basin4 from 2000 Maryland Section 305(b)Water Quality Report, Appendix F Watershed Bush River: Cranberry Run & Broad Run Bush River Number 02130701 -1129 02130701 Impairment Biological Sources Unknown Priority low  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  NPS, natural NPS, natural  low low  Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run  02130702 02130703  impairment not listed Nutrients Suspended Sediment NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural low low low low 18 low low low low low  02130704  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  Aberdeen Proving Ground  02130705  Toxic Substances Nutrients Suspended Sediment Toxic Substances  Swan Creek  02130706  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  5  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 work load projections, MDE has set several target years for establishing TMDLs for water bodies in the Bush River watershed. (Note 1: work load scheduling is subject to change.

Biological. Within selected stream segments, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Toxic Substances. A wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous or lethal affects or otherwise harm aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. A few examples are heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts.  8  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, three watersheds in the Bush River Basin watershed were listed for action under the highest priority for restoration (Category 1 Priority):  Bush River 02130701  Bynum Run 02130704  Swan Creek 02130706 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment used water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 watersheds which were applied to help characterize the Bush River Basin. The findings for the water quality indicators are summarized in the table below and are more thoroughly explained in the following text. Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  State 303(d) List Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Modeled TP Load Tidal Habitat Index Tidal Eutrophication Index  2 27.88 1.14 4.3 7.0  0 11.54 0.38  2 9.18 0.49  2 10.94 0.47  2 9.32 0.32  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  9  Swan Creek 2 15.28 0.67 Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Water Quality Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. State 303(d) Impairment In the Bush River Basin, all of the watersheds in the Basin are on the 303(d) list with the exception of Lower Winters Run. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the following watersheds have one or more water quality problems that need correction or restoration: Bush River, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek. 2. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load For the Bush River Basin, the total nitrogen (TN) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for Atkisson Reservoir and Aberdeen Proving Ground watersheds. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. All the other watersheds in the river basin has relatively high estimated total nitrogen loads reaching the Chesapeake Bay. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TN to the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient reaches streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much nitrogen, so higher TN loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Four watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek) exceeded this benchmark. 3. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load For the Bush River Basin, the total phosphorus (TP) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for four watersheds: Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Aberdeen Proving Ground. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. The TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from two Bush River Basin watersheds was estimated to be relatively high according to the computer model. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TP to the Chesapeake Bay. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much phosphorus, so higher TP loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. 10 Sept. 2002   To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds did exceeded this benchmark. 4. Tidal Habitat Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Habitat Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having poorer tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: algae populations as measured by surface chlorophyll a, water clarity as measured by secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""4.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed exceeded this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Eutrophication Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""7.0"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  Water Quality Background 1950s to 1988 Slow flushing characteristics of the Bush River tend to accentuate water quality problems there. It typically takes 48 days for this tidal fresh estuary to flush.8 Salinity in the tidal Bush River varies from about 5 parts per thousand (ppt) at the Chesapeake Bay to about 0.1 ppt in the upper Bush River to less than 0.05 ppt at the mouths of tributary creeks like Otter Point Creek.14 11 Sept. 2002   1. Tidal Bush River The earliest available water quality records covering the 1950s through 1965 noted high bacteria levels in the tidal Bush River. This a period before public sewerage services were offered in the Bush River watershed. The sources of this bacterial problem were believed to be existing discharges directly into the river including Bata Shoe, Edgewood Arsenal and probably effluent from private septic systems. Sampling in 1965 verified high bacterial populations in the river including E. Coli. These high bacterial populations were found in extensive areas of the upper tidal reaches of the Bush River and along the western shore of the Bush River toward the Chesapeake Bay. 11 1970s and 1980s In General Bacteria problems began to cause swimming closures in the Upper Bush River beginning in 1971. These problems were in-part associated with failing septic systems.8 Several projects gathered water quality data in the 1970s and 1980s: 1972 Goucher College Environmental Studies Program had sampling stations in the open tidal waters of the Bush River and near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 1977 DNR had sampling stations in the tidal waters of the Bush River.9 1980-82 CH2M Hill, a consultant working for Harford County had most sampling stations in open tidal waters of the Bush River with the exception of two stations near the tidal interface in Otter Point Creek and James Run. 9 1987 Harford County Dept. Of Public Works10 1988 Harford Community College12 Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations measured at all stations by CH2M Hill and DNR were higher than the minimum standard of 5.0 mg/l. However, 1972 dissolved oxygen sampling data showed several DO standard violations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 In 1987, DO concentrations below the standard were recorded at Church Creek, the upper Bush River and Otter Point Creek.10 Additional DO problems were reported in 1988 for Greys Run, Cranberry Run and Bynum Run.12 High fecal coliform bacteria populations were found by DNR in July 1977 up and down the tidal Bush River. 1982 monitoring by CH2M Hill found the highest fecal coliform bacteria populations and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) tended to be from their two stream stations. The next highest findings were found near Otter Point.9 Specific sources of these problems were believed to be associated with remaining failing septic systems even though about one-half of the watershed's population was now served by public sewer service.8 1987 sampling found four sites with fecal coliform bacteria greater than 200 MPN (most probable number): 2 stations in the upper Bush River, Winters Run at Rt 40 and James Run at Rt 40. Additionally, Bynum Run and Church Run were considered likely contributors.10 Winters Run was identified again for a high fecal coliform count in 1988.12 Algae blooms reported in the upper tidal Bush River were believed to be driven by nutrient inputs from tributary streams.9 In 1987, algae blooms in the upper Bush River north of the AMTRAK railway bridge was identified as a continuing issue. Nutrient concentrations in the tidal Bush River were high. For total phosphorus, concentrations 12 Sept. 2002   greater than 0.01 mg/l were considered to highly enriched. Monitoring in 1972-73 for DNR Power Plant Siting found total phosphorus concentrations were nearly always greater than this benchmark with peak concentrations between 0.05 and 0.07 mg/l. 19 1987 monitoring data found that the orthophosphorus fraction alone averaged between 0.04 and 0.08 mg/l. 10 For total inorganic nitrogen (which is collectively ammonia, nitrite and nitrate), concentrations greater than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/l were considered very high. 1972-73 data gathered for the DNR Power Plant Siting Program found organic nitrogen concentrations occasionally above 0.5 mg/l.19 Monitoring data found that ammonia nitrogen ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 mg/l and nitrate nitrogen ranged from 0.02 to 0.77 mg/l. Data for the two streams sampled supported the belief that tributary streams were a significant nutrient source for the Bush River. Additionally, 1972 data collected by the Goucher College Environmental Studies Program reported high nutrient concentrations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. In 1987, high nutrient concentrations tended to found at all sampling sites.10 In 1988, elevated nutrients were found at all sampling sites including Bynum Run, James Run, Greys Run and Cranberry Run. Additionally, a trend toward increasing nitrate concentrations was reported.12 Sedimentation problems were believed to be associated with urbanizing areas of the watershed.9 High sediment loads were reported in Lower Winters Run. 8 The County Dept. of Public Works identified several streams as the major sources of sediment to the upper Bush River in 1987: Otter Point Creek, James Run/Bynum Run, and Church Creek. Then, again in 1988, turbidity levels exceeding the State standard were reported for Bynum Run (the highest), Winters Run and James Run. 2. Atkisson Reservoir13 During the 1970s, excessive sediment movement in streams above the Reservoir was known to be a problem based on water intake records maintained by Maryland Water Works. Sampling in 1980 in the 38-year old Atkisson Reservoir found that 81% of its original volume had been lost to deposited sediment. That same year, stream surveys conducted upstream of the Reservoir found excessive sediment in Winters Run and Plum Tree Run near the Reservoir. However, turbidity in the reservoir in 1980 was not found to be a problem. [These findings may suggest that sediment mobilized upstream of the Reservoir tended to be larger particles that readily settled out in slack water, ed.] The Reservoir was characterized as eutrophic with algae blooms commonly occurring in summer. The blooms were believed to be caused by high total phosphorus concentrations in the Reservoir ranging from 0.07 to 0.52 mg/l. At the time, EPA criteria was 0.025 mg/l total phosphorus. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations were identified in deep waters of the Reservoir below the 13 foot depth. Bacterial problems in the Reservoir were identified in the 1960s and 1970s. Sampling in 1980 verified that fecal coliform counts were typically high. Temperature, pH, metals or pesticides were not identified as concerns in the Reservoir.  13  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment 1989 to the Present In the Bush River Basin (021307), there is one regularly scheduled long-term water quality monitoring effort for one station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River. All other monitoring is short term and special purpose. For example, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey collects water quality information in nontidal streams as part of its program. Additionally, MDE collected water quality data in 1999 to support permitting decisions and anticipated work on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).26 Cheseapeake Bay Program Tributary Monitoring Station WT1.1 shown on Map 6 Monitoring Stations is the best source of long term water quality data for the tidal Bush River. DNR Resource Assessment Service has analyzed data from this station and a summary of their findings appears in the table below. The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, the ranking of ""fair"", which is the most common ranking in the table, means that the Bush River ranking is fair compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. Additional discussion follows the table in this section. A more detailed look at the historic water quality record for this monitoring station is presented in Appendix A Selected Water Quality Historic Record for Bush River Station WT1.1. As part of DNR's work of the Upper Western Shore Tributary Team, this relative water quality assessment for the tidal Bush River and nearby tidal tributaries is presented in DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html. 1, 9 For additional information on water quality in general and Station WT1.1 specifically, see http://www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm and www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1998 -2000 data Fair Fair Poor Good Poor Fair Trend 1985 through 2000 No Trend Degrading (46%) Degrading (117%) No Trend No Trend No Trend  14  Sept. 2002   1. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total nitrogen concentrations varied slightly more than 1 mg/l averaging 1.2 mg/l for the year.  Total Nitrogen Station WT1.1 for 2001 2 1.8 1.6 MG/l 1.4 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 Months January Through December  2. Phosphorus Total phosphorus concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing concentrations suggesting worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total phosphorus concentrations varied about than 0.1 mg/l averaging 0.074 mg/l for the year.  Total Phosphorus Station WT1.1 for 2001 0.14 0.12 MG/l 0.1 0.08 0.06 0.04 Months January Through December  15  Sept. 2002   3. Algae Abundance of algae as measured by chlorophyl a Chlorophyll A concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 50 Bush River suggested ""poor"" 40 water quality. For the period 30 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing 20 concentrations suggesting 10 worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total 0 nitrogen concentrations varied Months January Through December more than 40 ug/l averaging about 25 micrograms per liter (ug/l). The year 2001 average chlorophyll a concentrations suggest that algae abundance is typically high enough to inhibit health of submerged aquatic vegetation during the growing season. MG/l  4. Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen Dissolved Oxygen concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 12 Bush River suggested ""good"" water 11 quality. For the period 1985 10 through 2000, there was no trend 9 toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows dissolved 8 oxygen concentrations varied about 7 5 mg/l averaging 9.2 mg/l for the 6 year. Measurements at this station Months January Through December have consistently met the State water quality standard of 5.0 mg/l during the past several years. Data collected from this station, due to its location in the middle of the Bush River's open tidal waters, probably does not reflect dissolved oxygen conditions in tidal waters in more restricted areas. MG/l  16  Sept. 2002   5. Water Clarity The measurement of water clarity for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 at station WT1.1 in the 0.6 Bush River using secchi disk depth suggested ""poor"" water 0.5 quality. For the period 1985 0.4 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. 0.3 During 2001, the graph shows secchi disk depth varied less 0.2 than one half meter averaging Months January Through December 0.4 meters for the year. Measurements from this station indicate that water clarity is too limited to support submerged aquatic vegetation. However, water clarity conditions in other parts of the tidal Bush River may differ significantly. MG/l  Secchi Disk Depth  6. Suspended Solids Total suspended solids concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total suspended solids concentrations varied about 30 mg/l averaging 28 mg/l for the year.

Chemical Contaminants Overall, the Bush River is identified by the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as an area with insufficient or inconclusive data.30 Sampling of sediment and the water column in the Bush River has not been conducted to support a more definitive statement. However, limited data in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed has identified toxic substances of concern in small areas. Additionally, the most recent Fish Consumption Advisory from the Maryland Dept. of the Environment identified PCBs, pesticides and methyl mercury in fish tissue as concerns.  MG/l  17  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. Permit information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Bush River basin is summarized in the table below and on Map 7 MDE Permits. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant The the Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) began operating in 1969 with a discharge to Romney Creek. By the late 1970s, the plant had expanded capacity from 4 million gallons per day (MGD) to 10 MGD. In October 1982, the discharge averaging about 5 MGD was moved to the Bush River in response to tightened discharge requirements for Romney Creek.9 In the Bush River watershed (02130701), the discharge from the Sod Run WWTP is the most important nutrient point source. For the year October 2000 to October 2001, the average effluent flow from the plant was 11 million gallons per day. The monthly average total phosphorus concentration for the period was 1.1 mg/l. For the same period, The monthly average total nitrogen concentration was 9.0 mg/l.27  21  Sept. 2002   MDE Permits Listing  Page 4 of 5 (Sept. 2001 data) Lower Winters Run Watershed 02130702 Atkisson Reservoir Watershed 02130703 Type / MDE Category Surface Water / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Facility Name Tollgate Landfill Permit(s) MD/NPDES 96DP2887 MD0065765 95DP1318 96DP2890 97SW1247 97SW0539 00MM2282 00HT9423 MDG679423 95MM9708 MDG499708 00HT9510 MDG679510 Winters Run Edgewood Osburn Lane, Joppa Winters Run Lake Vista Drive, Joppa Old Mountain Rd, Joppa Winters Run Bel Air Road Receiving Stream / Location Winters Run North Tollgate Road, Bel Air Norrisville Rd, Jarrettsville Bel Air Rd, Bel Air  Jarrettsville Elementary Village Volvo Alcore, Inc.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on several sources:  Listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  Modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization.  The Maryland Biological Stream Survey identified evidence of nonpoint source problems including erosion in the riparian area, streambank erosion and sedimentation. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Bush River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Bush River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations.  Urban stormwater management  Lawn maintenance issues  Potential stream maintenance projects 1. Erosion and Sedimentation Some Soils in the Bush River basin are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  Sedimentation Research Findings From Otter Point Creek The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the relation between sediment deposition and local marshes. A brief summary of recently completed research is included below. Sediment deposition from upstream areas created river delta areas of Otter Point Creek. The physical dynamics of this tidal freshwater delta area have been extensively quantified and modeled.14 Research on the historic conditions indicate that pre-settlement sedimentation rates were about half of rates from later times when agriculture covered 40 to 50% of the watershed. The long term sediment accumulation rate in Otter Point Creek was as high as 5 cm-yr during the 1840 to 1900 period. This rate is comparable to other delta areas in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. 14 Recent sedimentation cycle study found that marsh areas are growing due to sediment accumulation and incorporation into the marsh matrix.15 Study of marsh areas that were previously sewage lagoons at Otter Point Creek indicates that they tend to act as nitrogen sinks.16 This action is similar to that of other marshes and suggests that these areas act to improve water quality in their vicinity. 24 Sept. 2002   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Historic records show that very large areas of land on the Bush River's western shore appeared since the arrival of the Europeans.8 This new land includes most of the Edgewood Area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the southern shores of Otter Point Creek. It may be inferred that formation of this land was caused by extremely high erosion and sedimentation rates associated with the land clearing and management of the past 300 years. Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 25 Harford County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 30 2 - 4 feet / year 11 > 4 feet / year 5  140  46(33%)  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Maps produced for Harford County in 1995 included digitized shorelines. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Updates of these maps should be available by the end of 2002.  25  Sept. 2002   Water Supply In the Bush River Basin, there are eight providers for community water supply systems. The majority use groundwater as their source water but two have surface sources as shown on Map 8 Water Supply. Information for the surface water systems are summarized in the table below. The community systems served by groundwater in the Bush River Basin are summarized in the table Groundwater Community Water Supply Permits. The groundwater sources serving these systems are mostly unconfined aquifers with the exception of the Potomac Group Aquifer which is tapped by the Harford County Dept. of Public Works. Well head protection areas have been established for the wells operated by Harford County and the City of Aberdeen as shown on the map.23 The groundwater sources used for community systems in the Bush River Basin do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. In general, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land sources to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal or objective for a WRAS could be augmentation of existing programs to protect community water systems by targeting projects or controls in watersheds above surface water intakes.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which a watershed like those in the Bush River Basin can be compared with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. The following sections identify the findings for the watersheds in the Bush River Basin, with the exception of the population density indicator, which is based on 2000 Census data not available when the Unified Assessment was done.

Impervious Surface Based on estimates of imperious cover for each 8-digit watershed in the Bush River Basin averaged across each watershed, the percent of impervious surface cover varies from about 10% to over 30%. These findings for average imperviousness do not compare well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the Bush River watersheds exceeded this benchmark. 2. Population Density According to 2000 Census data, the population density in the watersheds in the Bush River Basin varied from less than one person per acre in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to more than three people per acre in the Bynum Run watershed. The figures in the table differ from those that appeared in the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment . A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  29  Sept. 2002   3. Historical Wetland Loss The estimated historic loss of wetlands in watersheds in the Bush River Basin varies from a relatively very small 258 acres in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to over 9700 acres in the Bush River watershed. This range of estimated wetland loss in Bush River Basin watersheds is relatively small compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not found to be in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams According to data used for the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment , only the Bynum Run watershed in the Bush River Basin had a relatively high percentage of unbuffered streams compared to other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bynum Run watershed exceed the benchmark because it was in the highest quartile. The other watersheds in the Bush River basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not in the highest quartile.  30  Sept. 2002   5. Soil Erodibility For four of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Swan Creek), the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is greater than 0.30 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important in these watersheds.2 For the Bush River watershed and the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is 0.18 and 0.01 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  31  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart summarize the Year 2000 land use for the Bush River Basin. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Just under 37% of the Bush River Basin is forest. This is up from the estimated 20% forest cover in the same area at the beginning of the 20th Century, which was the peak of deforestation in the area.14  Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use, 6-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (23.30%) Urban (34.74%)  Wetlands (4.92%) Other (0.45%)  Forest (36.59%)  2000 Land Use / Land Cover Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area in Acres (Md Dept. of Planning) Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 5,350 5,481 5,117 99 84 16,131 16,862 Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Agriculture Forest and Brush Urban Wetlands Other Land & Land Water Only Watershed Total  7,318 17,395 9,169 2,683 402 36,967 45,837  1,370 3,406 3,444 163 16 8,399 8,468  11,488 7,569 9,913 28 23 29,021 29,076  3,345 3,413 7,780 0 39 14,577 14,583  219 8,426 7,959 3,176 0 19,780 21,625  29,090 45,690 43,382 6,149 564 124,875 136,451  32  Sept. 2002  Total   Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use  8-Digit Watershed Pie Charts  Bush River 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (19.80%)  Lower Winters Run 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (16.31%) Urban (41.00%)  Urban (24.80%)  Wetlands (7.26%) Other (1.09%) Forest (47.06%) Wetlands (1.94%) Other (0.19%) Forest (40.55%)  Atkisson Reservoir 8-Digit Watershed  Bynum Run 8-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (22.95%)  Urban (34.16%)  Agriculture (39.59%) Urban (53.37%)  Wetlands (0.10%) Other (0.08%) Forest (26.08%)  Forest (23.41%) Other (0.27%) Wetlands (0.00%)  Aberdeen PG 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (1.11%)  Swan Creek 8-Digit Watershed  Urban (31.72%)  Agriculture (33.17%)  Urban (40.24%)  Forest (42.60%) Wetlands (0.61%) Other (0.52%)  Wetlands (16.06%)  Other (0.00%)  Forest (33.98%)  33  Sept. 2002   Large Forest Blocks / Forest Interior Large blocks of forest land cover are incorporated into the Green Infrastructure of the landscape. Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they can not tolerate much human presence. Map 10 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away). This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. While blocks of forest interior cover about 22% of the entire Bush River Basin, the amount of large-block forest interior varies significantly among the 8-digit watersheds in the river basin as summarized in the table below:  About one third of the two watersheds abutting the Chesapeake Bay (Bush River and Aberdeen PG) are covered by large blocks of forest interior.  Bynum Run watershed has the least forest interior cover relative to other Bush River watersheds.  The three remaining 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin have similar amounts of forest interior cover (between 14% and 18%).

In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs and the existing or potential connections between them are called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 11 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  Bush River Basin Green Infrastructure hubs tend to be located in lowlands near the Chesapeake Bay in two 8-digit watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground. These hubs appear to exist because of the protection from development pressure afforded by Federal ownership/management. Another large hub is located in the northern central portion of the Bush River watershed.  Lower Winters Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds have small Green Infrastructure hubs adjacent to major streams.  Bynum Run watershed has a small portion of a Green Infrastructure hub near its confluence with the Bush River. All other areas of natural vegetation in the watershed did not meet Green Infrastructure criteria (generally too small in size).  Swan Creek watershed has several Green Infrastructure hubs that are separated by the major highways serving the Baltimore / Philadelphia areas. Potential Next Steps. Green Infrastructure, Forest Interior Dwelling Species and other views of the landscape could be integrated into various local landuse planning and management scenarios.  35  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement and other mechanisms. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The table Protected Lands Summary and Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Bush River basin.  In the Bush River Basin, Federal land ownership accounts for nearly one third of the land. Federal Land dominates land ownership in two watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground.  Non-Federal land protection in the Lower Winters Run watershed is the highest percentage (9%) among watersheds (8-digit) in the Bush River Basin. This relatively high percentage of protection is mostly associated with the Otter Point Creek Park. This property has been designated as a component of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maryland. A total of 261 acres of open water and 672 acres of adjoining wetlands and uplands are protected for long-term estuarine research and monitoring and for estuarine education. 4 Potential Next Steps. Existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors or hubs for WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Watershed location should be a factor in considering land protection opportunities.  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects.  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  36  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary * Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area Protected in Acres Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 247 0 136 0 0 719 2% 7% Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Conservation Easements DNR Land County Parks Agricultural Easements Agricultural Districts Federal Land Percent of Watershed Protected  435 530 132 359 189 13,390 4% 41%  362 0 62 312 0 0 9% 9%  15 0 804 710 361 0 5% 7%  73 70 30 0 35 0 1% 1%  0 0 0 0 0 19,795 0% 100%  33,904 3% 31%  The percent on top excludes agricultural districts and Federal land.

In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Harford County's Rural Legacy Area is located entirely outside of the Bush River Basin, which is mostly in the Deer Creek watershed. - Priority Funding Areas (PFA) in Harford County are mostly in the Bush River Basin with relatively small areas of PFA located in other County watershed areas. The table below shows the relative PFA area for the Bush River watersheds. Priority Funding Areas (PFA) Summary Bush River Basin Watershed PFA Acres Name Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen PG Swan Creek Bush River Basin Total Acres 36,967 8,399 29,021 14,577 19,780 16,131 124,875 12,834 5,160 5,860 12,066 2,016 3,965 41,901 Percent of Watershed In PFA 35% 64% 20% 83% 10% 25% 34%  Note: Data is from 2000. Acreage in PFAs and protected land acreage are not mutually exclusive. It is common for park land, which is commonly considered to be protected, to be in a PFA to facilitate receiving State funding for park infrastructure. For example, Otter Creek Park is protected from development but it is entirely within a PFA. Therefore, protected land acreage and percentage of a watershed should only be used as an indicator of general direction for development.  38  Sept. 2002   Soils of the Bush River Basin 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor Natural Soil Groups for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil Bush River Basin conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Harford County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using (27.21%) (29.91%) Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. The pie chart shows the distribution of percentages of soils based on broad categories: (16.14%) -- Yellow - prime agricultural soils (26.74%) -- Green - all other well drained soils including stony/rocky soils -- Blue - all poorly drained soils including wetlands and marshes and soils with perched watertables. -- White - unclassified soils including all of Aberdeen Proving Ground The Map 13 Soils shows that prime farmland, depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching, is widely distributed across the Bush River Basin. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Using Prime Farmland as an example, the scattered location of prime agricultural soils in the Bush River Basin suggests that agricultural preservation efforts need to be targeted to selected areas and prioritized for action to help ensure that protection efforts result in viable agricultural communities. Additionally, prioritization of agricultural cost share funding to these areas could provide additional incentive for local land owners to participate in agricultural preservation programs. Comparing Map 13 Soils with Map 9 2000 Land Use and Map 11 Green Infrastructure suggests other potential watershed planning approaches. For example, two Green Infrastructure hubs are located north of the tidal Bush River along upper James Run and Grays Run. In these areas, land owners tended to leave poor soils in natural vegetation because the soils were wet or stony. Targeting natural resource protection efforts to areas like this, which offer poor suitability for active use, could benefit both land owners and natural resource protection.  39  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26  The Bush River Basin has a great diversity of wetland types relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because it includes both Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic areas and it has both tidal and nontidal freshwater waterbodies. Map 14 Wetlands In The Bush River Basin shows the general distribution of wetlands based on the National Wetlands Inventory. The majority of the wetland acreage in the river basin is on Federal land Brief descriptions of the major wetland categories found in the River Basin are listed below. Estuarine Wetlands. These systems consist of brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where freshwater runoff from the land receives some saltwater influence. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Bush River Basin's Coastal Plain covering nearly 5,700 acres. Brackish marshes are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay and they are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These systems are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In the Bush River Basin, this wetland type covers slightly more than 3,700 acres. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant but are represented in the Bush River Basin. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) Lacustrine wetlands (associated with lakes) and Riverine wetlands (associated with rivers) cover relatively small areas of the Bush River river basin: 54 acres and 21 acres respectively. 2. Wetland Studies In the Bush River Basin The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of plant populations in local marshes. During the 1990s, a plant list for Otter Point Creek compiled by William Hilgartner identified 133 species of herbaceous plants and 39 species of woody plants.17  40  Sept. 2002   3. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have amounted to a small net increase in nontidal wetland acreage in the Bush River watershed. Research findings from Otter Point Creek associated with the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the changes over time in local marshes. According to research reported in 1998, the mix of wetland types in the upper Otter Point Creek tidal freshwater marshes has changed greatly since early colonial times. In about 1730, nearly the entire marsh area here was subtidal, i.e. the marsh was mostly underwater. By 1990, the same marsh area had changed so that its area was roughly one third subtidal, one third intertidal and one third forested.14 The change appears to be associated with sediment deposition and incorporation into the marsh.15 Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Bush River Basin In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 20 Basin Code 02130701 02130702 02130703 02130704 02130705 02130706 021307 Watershed Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen Proving Ground Swan Creek Permanent Impacts -8.01 -3.43 -3.55 -8.37 -0.13 -5.27 Permittee Mitigation 10.19 8.47 9.03 6.15 0 7.85 Programmatic Gains 0 0 0 0 0 2.20 Other Gains 0.76 0 0 0 0 0 Net 2.94 5.05 5.48 -2.22 -0.13 4.78  Bush River -28.75 41.71 2.20 0.76 15.91 Basin Notes: Only nontidal wetland changes are shown, tidal wetland changes are excluded.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Bush River Watershed (02130701) are shown in Map 15 Wetlands On NonFederal Land: Bush River Watershed. The table below accompanies the map with a summary of wetland categories and acreage. Based on the DNR wetlands data used for the map, forested fresh water wetlands are the largest category of wetlands in this area. The data source used for this interpretation has not been completed for the entire Bush River Basin. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)

However, coverage for the Bush River Basin (021307) is incomplete. The National Wetlands Inventory is available for the entire Bush River Basin but it has a lower resolution and, therefore, identifies a smaller wetland acreage for the same geographic area. In comparison, the generalized land use / land cover data presented earlier in this chapter is the lowest resolution data that identifies wetlands and, therefore, identifies even fewer wetlands in the same geographic area. See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion on Wetlands of Special State Concern.  42  Sept. 2002   Floodplains and Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Floodplains and associated riparian areas are naturally important areas for habitat and hydrologic functioning of streams. Map 16 Floodplain shows that the most 100-year floodplains in the Bush River Basin are located on Federal land. On non-Federal land, two of the largest 100-year floodplain areas are on lower Winters Run and near the confluence of Bynum Run and James Run. Most floodplain areas are too small to be seen at the basin-wide scale and require subwatershed scale or smaller assessment. Most areas of the Bush River Basin have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Marylandwide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report. According to this report, all the at-risk areas identified in the Bush River Basin are on Federally managed land.24 Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions and other stakeholders as it becomes available. Potential Next Steps. Protection of people and property has always been the core of floodplain management. Additional objectives for watershed management relative to floodplains may include conservation of habitat, targeting for restoration of wetlands and stream buffers, and prioritization for protecting selected areas from development or inappropriate uses. Using information gathered in the Stream Corridor Assessment, restoring natural floodplain and wetland function can be one criteria for prioritizing stream restoration projects. Maintaining stable floodplains on a watershed-wide basis can be a factor in determining stormwater management requirements including control of impervious area in a watershed.  43  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Bush River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time or resources. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats and other factors should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  44  Sept. 2002   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality and habitat. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Bush River Basin.2 In the table below, ""attain"" means watershed conditions are at least as good as the benchmark. ""Exceed"" means that watershed conditions are not as good as the benchmark. An empty box in the table """", means that an indicator could not be generated. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS.  Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Requirement Attainment Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  1.0 2.0 ----  ------  --4.4 8.50 5.98  ---8.30 6.01  ------  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  45  Swan Creek ---- Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Living Resource Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""2.0"" for the Habitat Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 The Coastal Plain stream benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment , reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average benthic IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir watershed's ranking of less than 6.0 caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"" for this index.  46  Sept. 2002   4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 As interest in whole ecosystems, and ecosystem health, has grown, Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured-- numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition). To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average fish IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds both had higher index ranks higher than 6.0. 5. Nontidal In-stream Habitat Index 21 In the Bush River Basin two watersheds had sufficient data for assessment in the nontidal instream habitat index. Both the Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds received a score of 6 out of a possible range of scores from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""exceed"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value and other factors. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  47  Sept. 2002   Fish and Shellfish 1. Tidal Waters The Bush River is an important spawning and nursery ground for many fish species.19 A survey conducted during the period March 1972 to June 1973 found that the Bush River has considerable spawning by several anadromous, semi-anadromous and local species. These included the commercially important species of striped bass, white perch and herring. It found a wide range of types of fish inhabiting the area. However, two species were clearly dominant in numbers: white perch were said to be ubiquitous and anchovy were found seasonally. 19 Commercial fisheries harvest information is tracked by Maryland DNR Fisheries Service. This information is available on DNR's Internet site. The Bush River's data is reported for several important commercial species as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay geographic area (above Worton Point). Reporting for other commercially harvested species is not summarized here because reports are for even larger geographic areas.  Blue Crabs: Commercial harvest reporting for blue crabs groups Bush River data with the Upper Chesapeake Bay above Worton Point. For this wider area, commercial blue crab harvest for the 1992 to 1999 was significantly higher than in previous years. Since 1992, the annual harvest tended to be greater that 1 million pounds with a significantly higher peak in 1995 of 2,266,000 pounds.  Oysters: There is no commercial oyster harvest in the Bush River because the regulatory shellfish harvesting restrictions prevent oyster harvest. Even so, the commercial harvest in the entire Upper Chesapeake Bay is a minuscule percentage of the Bay-wide harvest. The very low salinity of the area inhibits oyster habitat and survival.  Striped Bass: The reported annual harvest for striped bass in 1999 from the Bush River was 5,583 pounds. Prior to 1999, Bush River data was reported as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay (north of Worton Point). During the late 1990s, the annual harvest for the Upper Bay including the Bush River was typically around 70,000 pounds with one exception in 1998 with a larger harvest of 97,000 pounds. The Chesapeake Bay's most important striped bass spawning and nursey area is considered to be the Upper Chesapeake Bay based on area size and productivity. The estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the productivity of this area but the relative value of the Bush River is not well understood. 2. Nontidal Areas General information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See MBSS Findings for summary information. The Designated Use of Bynum Run as Use 3 Natural Trout Waters suggests that brook trout where found here. However, DNR Fisheries Service has no records that naturally reproducing trout populations exist anywhere in the Bush River Basin.28 48 Sept. 2002   3. Fish Consumption In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories including significant limitations on consumption of some fish species in the Bush River area. The advisory recommends not eating channel catfish and severely limiting meals of white perch caught in the Bush River mainstem. The concern in these fish is contamination from PCBs and/or pesticides. Methylmercury is also a contaminate of concern primarily for some fish species caught in lakes. The table below summarizes advisory for areas in the Bush River Basin. More complete information is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html In issuing the 2001 advisory, MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to advisories to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing. Bush River Basin - 2001 Advisory On Fish Consumption Recommended Maximum Allowable Meals Per Month Species Channel Catfish White Perch Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pickerel, Northern Pike, Walleye Bluegill Area Bush River mainstem Bush River mainstem Lakes and other impoundments Rivers and streams Lakes and other impoundments General Population 8oz meal 0 1 4 no advisory 8 Women 6oz meal 0 1 4 8 8 Children 3oz. meal 0 0 2 8 8 Methylmercury PCBs, Pesticides Contaminant  49  Sept. 2002   Algae Based on surveys conducted in 1972-73, the Bush River estuary was found to be rich in phytoplankton throughout most of the spring, summer and early autumn. The survey found nothing peculiar, special or unusual regarding the phytoplankton community. Of the six most common species found, five were diatoms and one was a bluegreen algae. As an indicator of the extent of green algae populations, chlorophyll a concentrations only occasionally reached high levels above 50 ug/l. The highest chlorophyll a concentration reported during the study was 139 ug/l.19  Maryland Biological Stream Survey  21, 22  Assessment of biological communities in nontidal streams, like macroinvertebrates, fish and their physical habitat can help with interpretation of aquatic conditions from the perspective of living resources. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) has been conducting these assessments Statewide since 1994. More recently, beginning in the year 2000, MBSS has also facilitated collection of benthic macroinvertebrate information by citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program. The MBSS approach involves assessment of each site using a suite of criteria including identification of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate species present. The findings from the criteria are then combined to generate an index for benthic organisms, fish and for physical habitat. The table below shows the scales used to rate findings for the sites shown on the accompanying maps and the table MBSS Findings Summary for the period 1994 through 2000. Additional explanation of the purpose and value of assessing benthic organisms is presented in the text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams . More complete information on the MBSS program and findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Map 17 Benthic Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 18 Fish Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 19 Physical Habitat Index Scale of 0 to 100 0 to 11.99 12 to 41.99 42 to 71.99 72 to 100  Category Very Poor Poor Fair Good  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the fish/benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has conditions that are close to those found in a comparable 50 Sept. 2002   ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poor deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. Additional monitoring by MBSS is scheduled for the Bush River Basin to assess the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.)10 Sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program is anticipated to continue during this time. Potential Next Steps. MBSS provides site-specific information on nontidal streams that can be considered in the WRAS process to prioritize potential restoration and protection projects. Additionally, for selected streams or project areas, before and after monitoring using MBSS methods can provide a gauge of success for individual projects. MBSS methods can also provide a measure of progress toward water quality improvement goals based on biological indicators.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae, to invertebrates like crayfish and insects, to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish and similar creatures. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  52  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Bush River Basin. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  53  Sept. 2002   2. Wetlands of Special State Concern The Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) in the Bush River Basin are shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species though most are difficult to see at the scale of the map. The largest groupings of the WSSCs are listed in the summary table below. Wetlands of Special State Concern  Areas of Concentration In The Bush River Basin Watershed Name Bush River Watershed 02130701 Acres 28 Stream Vicinity Otter Point Creek North of Sod Run Church Creek Atkisson Reservoir 02130703 Swan Creek 02130706 Bush River Basin 021307 37 44 109 Atkisson Reservoir Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area Community Vicinity Flying Point Road / Willoughby Woods area South of Perryman Road, ""Perryman Woods"" area North of Rt 40, ""Church Creek Pond"" Harford Glen Center and Aberdeen PG property Oakington Road, Swan Harbor Farm Park  3. Maryland Darter In the Swan Creek watershed (02130706), Gashey's Run was declared critical habitat for the Federally endangered Maryland darter by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. This designation, in part, means that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reviews activities that meet two conditions 1) a federal permit, license and/or funding in involved, and; 2) there is a potential to impact the species or its habitat.26  54  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Bush River Basin  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 26 SSPRAs are identified in the Bush River Basin. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 20 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Bush River basin (Md 6-digit wateshed). NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) There are three concentrations of WSSCs designated in the WRAS project area and several are designated elsewhere in the Bush River Basin. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  55  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance makes SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. In addition to its value as a water quality indicator, SAV is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 21 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation shows that during the 1980s and 1990s distribution of SAV in the Bush River basin is generally very sparse. Within the WRAS project area, all the SAV areas that were large enough to identify using aerial photography were located adjacent to Federal land. Elsewhere in the Bush River Basin, the largest concentration of SAV has been near Swan Creek. Experience obtained through years of monitoring SAV demonstrates that acreage in the Bush River fluctuates from year to year. For example, SAV acreage in Bush River during the year 2000 was at least 17% and 12 acres greater than acreage in 1999.29 The map also shows that potential SAV habitat area based on a water depth of two meters or less. This shallow depth covers extensive areas of the Bush River and the perimeter of the Bush River Basin adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. It is believed that the limitations exhibited by historic SAV distribution compared to potential habitat relate in part to excessive nutrient and suspended sediment loads in the Bush River and the Upper Chesapeake Bay. The nutrient loads appear to be driving algae growth that competes with SAV for sunlight. Additionally, suspended sediment also blocks the sunlight which reduces the light that reaches SAV leaves. Potential Next Steps. Beginning in early 2002, Harford County and numerous Federal and State agencies began cooperating to pool their information on SAV and to generate a consensus on SAV management for the Bush River. The findings and results of this effort can be integrated into the local watershed management strategy. The Anita C. Leight Estuary Center and Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) will begin a long term research and restoration project to restore native SAV species to Otter Point Creek and surrounding waters. The staff are using innovative ""SAV planting grids"" and will be using multiple species of SAV to determine the most suitable species, or combination of species, for restoration to the site. Also see Related Projects.  56  Sept. 2002   RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Harford County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment on Church Creek in the Bush River watershed in 2002. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  Potential Next Steps. Harford County has demonstrated success in using Stream Corridor Assessments to identify restoration projects. For the WRAS, this information can be used as a foundation to prioritize/target geographic areas for restoration and/or types of projects for implementation in a watershed-based management strategy.  Recent Stream Corridor Assessments Harford has completed several Stream Corridor Assessments in the Bush River Basin including Bynum Run (1995-1996), Swan Creek (Spring 1994 - Spring 1995) and Winters Run (1998). Each report identifies each site where problems are identified and ranks its severity relative to other sites. Each report also singles out specific sites that are considered particularly severe. As an example of this work, the table below summarizes the findings from the Bynum Run effort.7  57  Sept. 2002   Bynum Run Stream Corridor Assessment Findings Matrix for Winter 1995-1996 Potential Problems Identified Count Length Est. feet / miles 86,818 / 16.4 Severity Frequency 1 23 24 45 62,954 / 11.9 12,554 / 2.4 14 15 1 6 2 3,100 / 0.6 2 132 2 50 8 26 22 3 5 5 1 -120 3 82 33 35 47 20 9 6 4 2 238 4 49 43 22 22 19 2 1 2 -160 5 11 64 15 13 14 7 5 1 5 135  Erosion (stream banks) Pipe Outfalls Fish Blockages Inadequate Buffers, Unshaded Streams Channel Alternation Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping Livestock TOTAL  214 172 143 118 71 24 23 10 9 784  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Based on 2002 sampling in the Bush River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Bush River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  58  Sept. 2002   Aricultural Conservation Programs Harford County has a high level of participation in agricultural conservation programs. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Harford Soil Conservation District (HSCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Harford SCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Potential Next Steps. Encouraging implementation of BMPs, nutrient management, participation in conservation programs and other agricultural approaches to protecting water quality are important elements in local water management strategy that can be augmented through the WRAS process.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the five marinas in the Bush River offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 22 Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  59  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Bush River Basin appears in the Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities Table and Map 23 Fish Blockages. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for Stream Corridor Assessments that have been completed or are planned. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. Of the more than twenty fish blockages listed in the database, one on Lower Winters Run known as Van Bibber Dam was mitigated in 1990. Correction of this blockage reconnected a large segment of Lower Winters Run to the Chesapeake Bay. Potential Next Steps. In general, mitigation or removal of a blockage to fish movement is recommended if the change would open a significant stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. DNR Fisheries Service can provide technical advice and potentially funding for mitigation projects. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of lakes, farm ponds or drainage ditches. If a blockage is found in any of these categories, circumstances like requirements for public recreation needs, drainage control function, land owner needs and other factors are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  60  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 1 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Bush River 02130701 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  BU010 BU011 BU012 BU013 BU014  Gray's Run James Run James Unnamed Tributary Unnamed Tributary yes Otter Point Creek Lower Winters Run Lower Winters Run Winters Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run  Carsins Run Road 0.25 miles above I-95 James Run Road Gulf Road 0.3 miles below Rt. 159 0.1 miles above Edgewood 50ft below Atkisson Dam 0.2 miles above Singer Road 25 yards above Rt 1 1 mile below Wheel Road 1 mile above Wheel Road 0.8 miles above Wheel Road 0.5 miles below St. Andrews Rd. 0.1 mile below St. Andrews Rd. 0.6 miles below Rt. 1 0.7 miles below Rt 23 Rt 23  Lower Winters Run 02130702 Atkisson Res. 02130703 Bynum Run 02130704  BU016 BU017 BU018 BU019 BU001 BU002 BU003 BU004 BU005 BU006 BU007 BU008  Aberdeen PG 02130705  no blockages listed in database  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  61  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 2 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Swan Creek 02130706 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  CW010 CW011 CW030 CW031 CW032 CW063 CW064  Gashey's Creek Gashey's Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek  0.2 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road 0.1 mile above Rt. 40 100 ft. above Oak St. 130 yards above Oak Street 0.33 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  62  Sept. 2002   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps.  63  Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. Restoration of stream buffers is a valuable agricultural Best Management Practice Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates (BMP). By identifying land uses By Land Use in riparian areas with inadequate Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) stream buffers, like crop land Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment adjacent to streams, the potential (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) to reduce nutrient and sediment loads can be improved. To Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 assist in finding areas with crop Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 land adjacent to streams, the same land use data shown in Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover can be filtered using GIS. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 The new scenario shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 64 Sept. 2002   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Bush River Basin, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the central part of the Bush River Basin. The map suggests that several areas north of Bel Air have unbuffered streams on hydric soils. This type of area could offer opportunities to restore stream buffers and intercept nitrogen in near-surface groundwater before it reached the nearby stream. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of current field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. 65 Sept. 2002   In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Bush River Basin, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in tidal portions of the Bush River arise from multiple tributary streams and tidal exchange with the Chesapeake Bay, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in tidal waters. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, and providing erosion control and sediment trapping. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, dredging or filling has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Bush River and Bynum Run 8-digit watersheds, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (mostly agricultural fields or bare ground) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. 66 Sept. 2002   Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are numerous concentrations of hydric soils that are near existing wetlands. These areas could be candidates for wetland restoration. The areas identified on the map along Lower Winters Run near the existing protected land at Otter Point could offer both restoration and natural resource protection opportunities within an existing management program.  In comparing Map 26 with Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land , several areas appear in both the stream buffer and the wetland restoration scenarios. For example, the headwaters area of Broad Run, James Run and Grays Run may be candidates for restoration projects that could meet multiple natural resource and water quality protection objectives. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership and other factors. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  67  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is not currently funding projects in the Bush River Basin.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. 2002 SAV Experiment In Otter Point Creek Three species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) have been transplanted from grow out stations at the Anita C. Leight Estuary Center to prescribed areas of Otter Point Creek to test habitat suitability. This project was conducted by Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) staff along with volunteers as part of the Reserves' research function. 2. Anita C. Leight Estuary Center 2002 Access Improvement The Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve partnered with DNR Program Open Space, Harford County Parks and Recreation and the Harford Land Trust to purchase property near the Anita C. Leight Park which is in the Otter Point Component of the Reserve. Subject to necessary approvals and permits, improvements will include replacement an existing unsafe pier with an ADA accessible pier, addition of an ADA path from the parking area to the pier, and a parking lot upgrade to create a safe ADA parking. The new area will be used for public canoe and pontoon boat programs and as a monitoring site.  68  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Bush River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 69 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criteria #3 Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  70  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES  1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

United States Geological Survey Surface water quality standards consist of two parts: (a) designated uses of each water body; and (b) water quality criteria necessary to support the designated uses. Designated uses of for all surface waters in Maryland (like shell fish harvesting or public water supply) are defined in regulation. Water quality criteria may be qualitative (like ""no objectionable odors"") or quantitative (toxic limitations or dissolved oxygen requirements). All the land that drains to an identified body of water or point on a stream.

Each graph shows two lines: one showing the average measurment for each month and one showing the standard deviation. The example below suggests how to interpret the graphs. Abbreviation key for the graphs: AVG - Average measurement for each month based on the historic record. STD - Standard Deviation for each month based on the historic record.  Total Phosphorus (TP) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is slightly less than 0.10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is 0.025 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.075 mg/l and 0.125 mg/l - This range for total phosphorous indicates fair water quality.  Total Nitrogen (TN) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is about 1.2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is close to 0.5 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.7 mg/l and 1.7 mg/l - This range for total nitrogen indicates fair water quality.  106  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 2 of 4  107  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 3 of 4  108  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 4 of 4  109  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B Maryland Biological Stream Survey 2000-2004 Volume 1 Ecological Assessment of Watersheds Sampled in 2000 Prepared for Maryland Department of Natural Resources Prepared by Nancy E.

These watersheds are in the central portion of the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area. The WRAS project area encompasses about 46,204 acres including about 11,471 acres of open water. The purpose of the WRAS project is for Worcester County and various stakeholders to determine local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. As part of the WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field inspection data to catalog issues and rate problem severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The County will use this information to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Maryland's Coastal Bays, including the WRAS project area, are salty water bodies with salinty that varies between 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt. Tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) for impairments associated with low dissolved oxygen, nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria. Both watersheds are affected by MDE's statewide fish consumption advisory due to methylmercury. The Newport Bay watershed has an approved Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that addresses nitrogen in three tidal creeks and the bay and biological oxygen demand in Kitts Branch. Nutrient loads in this watershed are mostly from nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources generate about 49% of the nitrogen load, point sources contribute about 30%and the remainder comes from atmospheric deposition and groundwater. Phosphorus loads are about 80% from nonpoint sources and 20% from point sources. Nonpoint source phosphorus in the water is mostly associated with movement of sediment. Sinepuxent Bay has a small area closed to shellfish harvesting due to a sewage effluent discharge from the Assateague Island Park visitor facility. The average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin was measured at 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l) during the winters of 1999 and 2000. This level is significantly higher than the previously assumed level of 0.72 mg/l. Average groundwater nitrate was found to be low in most areas. However, high nitrates in groundwater, ranging from 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l, characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek on the west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. Several smaller areas exhibited higher average nitrate levels.  vi   The Landscape According to Maryland Department of Planning 2000 data, land use differs in the two watersheds. The Newport Bay watershed is relatively rural: 11% developed, 34% agriculture, 43% forest/scrub and 12% wetland. The Sinpuxent Bay watershed has twice the developed area and one-third the agricultural area. However, the greatest concentration of impervious area is in the Town of Berlin, which drains to Newport Bay. Both watersheds have significant green infrastructure, forest with large interior area and wetlands. In the Newport Bay watershed, most of this land is not protected from land use conversion. A large proportion of these areas in Sinepuxent Bay watershed are protected by the Assateague Island parks system. About 37% of these watersheds is prime agricultural land. Over 48% of the soils in these watersheds exhibit hydric conditions. Some areas of hydric soils are ditched to improve drainage. The most prevalent wetland type in both watersheds is emergent wetland. However, the Newport Bay watershed has a large portion of forested palustrine wetlands (freshwater wetlands not associated with lakes, rivers or streams. Sinepuxent Bay watershed has a relatively large portion of unconsolidated shore wetlands  mostly on the bay-side of the barrier island. In the long term, a large area of the WRAS Project Area may be affected by sea level rise. Living Resources and Habitat Tidal fish species of commercial and recreational importance are showing signs of improvement following significant declines in population in the 1980s and 1990s. Sensitive species identified in these watersheds include 20 plant and five animal species including two Federally listed birds: the bald eagle and the piping plover. Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) beds have been increasing their coverage since monitoring began in the 1980s. SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays was nearly eliminated by disease in the 1930s. Sinepuxent Bay has a significantly larger area of SAV than Newport Bay. Restoration Targeting Tools Scenarios for potential stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration targeting suggests that opportunities for further assessment may be available. Current field data gathered by the Stream Corridor Assessment and the Synoptic Survey will help develop a list of issues for further investigation and identify sites that could be used in restoration efforts.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Worcester County Department of Comprehensive Planning Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources Sandy Coyman, David Honick, Katherine Munson, Keota Silaphone  Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service David Bleil, Mary Conley, Katharine Dowell, Greta Guzman, Danielle Lucid, Robin Pelicano, Niles Primrose, Ted Weber, John Wolf, Ken Yetman Forest Service Anne Hairston-Strang Fisheries Service Harley Speir Resource Assessment Service Ellen Friedman, Renee Karrh, Catherine Wazniak Wildlife & Heritage Division Lynn Davidson, Tim Larney Maryland Department of the Environment John Grace, Kelly Neff, John Smith, Robert Daniel  Others  Editor and Primary Author: Ken Shanks, Maryland Department of the Natural Resources, Watershed Services, Landscape and Watershed Analysis Division  viii   INTRODUCTION Background In 1998, Maryland completed an assessment of all the state's watersheds in order to identify high priorities for restoration action based on impaired waters and high priorities for conservation action based on high or unique natural resource value. The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds in Worcester County, where the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are located Watershed Land Water Total within the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area as shown in Map 1 Newport Bay 27,229 5,264 32,493 Location. These watersheds are Sinepuxent Bay 7,504 6,207 13,711 located entirely within Worcester County as highlighted in Map 2 Newport and 34,733 11,471 46,204 Project Area. This area is the focus of Sinepuxent Bays the WRAS and this Watershed Characterization. The adjacent table shows that about one quarter of the WRAS project area is open water. Map 2 also shows that DNR subdivides the Newport Bay watershed into four ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes. No Sinepuxent Bay subwatersheds are defined by DNR. The table Subwatersheds provides additional details on these subwatersheds. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a WRAS is to characterize the watershed using available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important information and issues 1        provide preliminary findings identify information or analysis needs suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. provide a common base of knowledge about the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations  Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Worcester County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay WRAS Project Area ""8-Digit"" Watershed Number/ Name 02130104 Sinepuxent Bay ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Name and Number same as 8-digit 0681 Area in Acres Description Water 6,207 Land* 7,504 Total 13,711 Entire 8-digit Watershed Includes Massey Br.

Historically, the emphasis has been on chemical water quality. More recently, additional factors are being considered like measurements of selected biological conditions and physical conditions that affect habitat quality in streams and estuaries. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are assigned two uses: - Use I, Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All surface waters not designated as Use II. - Use II, Shellfish Harvesting Waters: All portions of the territorial seas and estuarine portions of bays and tributaries except: Ocean City Harbor above the entrance to West Ocean City Harbor Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Each impairment listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment in the affected water body.5 Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds include waters affected by the water quality or habitat problems listed and discussed below: Dissolved Oxygen Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fish Consumption Advisory  4   1. Dissolved Oxygen The draft 2002 303(d) list identifies dissolved oxygen impairment in tidal portions of both Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The origins of the dissolved oxygen problem are listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. Aquatic life requires a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water to allow for respiration and survival. If DO concentrations diminish beyond the range of tolerance for the species in a water body, mobile species like fish attempt to leave low DO areas in search more suitable areas. Individuals unable to escape die when DO concentrations drop below tolerance levels. To help ensure that waters of the State provide sufficient levels of dissolved oxygen to support aquatic life, the State of Maryland has a DO water quality standard in regulation. The standard requires that dissolved oxygen concentrations be maintained at 5.0 mg/l or higher. Water bodies in which DO levels are known to fall below 5.0 mg/l on a reoccurring basis are listed as impaired in the 303(d) list. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources. As shown in Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions, a small portion of Sinepuxent Bay is affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to the Assateague Island State Park Visitor Center are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because areas near treated sewage effluent discharges have the potential to receive elevated levels fecal coliform bacteria. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal or human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. 3. Nutrients The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list and in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nutrients are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. High nutrient loads, particularly nitrogen in the Newport Bay, contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Newport Bay system. The section Total Maximum Daily Loads gives additional information. 5   In general, nutrients can lead to the problems noted above in several ways. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Coastal Bays, when high nutrient loads coincide with warm weather and sufficient light, algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. However, most of the nutrients in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bays are generated within their respective watersheds. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. The fraction of the total nitrogen load contributed by the atmosphere typically originates at burning fossil fuels in power plants and other industries, and from automobiles. Also see What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 4. Fish Consumption Advisory Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001. An update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend limiting human consumption as described in the table below. The table is adapted from www.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish 2003 Advisory On Fish Consumption Affecting Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Recommended Maximum Allowable Meals Per Month Species Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pickerel, Northern Pike, Walleye Bluegill Area Affected Statewide Lakes and other impoundments Rivers and streams Lakes and other impoundments General Population 8oz meal 4 no advisory 8 Women 6oz meal 4 8 8 Children 3oz. meal 2 8 8 Methylmercury Contaminant  6   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) list to determine the need for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water body can accept while still allowing it to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one TMDL has been drafted that directly affects the WRAS project area encompassing the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen for Three Tidal Tributaries and Total Maximum Daily Load of Biological Oxygen Demand for One Tributary in the Newport Bay System, Worcester County, Maryland, was submitted to EPA in January 2003. The following sections summarize key parts of the TMDLs set in the report. 1. Nitrogen TMDLs In The Newport Bay Watershed The Newport Bay mainstem receives flows and pollutants from numerous tributaries. In 1998, MDE conducted water quality monitoring to support its TMDL work. Analysis of this data and data from other sources covering the same time frame lead MDE to the conclusion that control of nitrogen would limit algae growth in the Newport Bay system. In response, MDE has designed nitrogen TMDLs for several areas in the Newport Bay watershed as described below and summarized in the table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs:  There are five subwatersheds in the Newport Bay system that were addressed in the TMDL report. Three subwatersheds received nitrogen TMDLs (Ayer Creek, Newport Creek/Trappe Creek and Newport Bay), one BOD TMDL (Kitts Branch) and Marshall Creek had insufficient data and modeling limitations to allow generation of a TMDL.  Nitrogen TMDLs are designed to address needs in specific areas of the Newport Bay system. The goals of these TMDLs are to improve water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l and by reducing algae blooms as measured by chlorophyll a. The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay is intended to constrain the total nitrogen load from the entire Newport Bay watershed while the TMDLs for its tributaries are intended to control local problem areas.  The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay will require nearly a 47% total load reduction from current nitrogen loads. MDE reported that the total nitrogen load to Newport Bay is 407,551 pounds per year based on water quality monitoring. The sum of the monthly nitrogen loads listed as limits for Newport Bay in table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs is 218,209 pounds per year of nitrogen.  7   Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs in Pounds/Month Watershed Area Ayer Creek Newport Cr. / Trappe Cr.

Biological Oxygen Demand TMDL for Kitts Branch Kitts Branch, which drains an area around the town of Berlin, flows into Trappe Creek and then to Newport Bay. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) TMDL for Kitts Branch is designed to protect water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l during spring and summer low-flow conditions. The spring TMDL is 6,132 pounds per month from April 1 to May 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical spring nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 100 pounds per day (around 3,000 pounds per month). The summer TMDL is 1,369 pounds per month from June1 to Oct. 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical summer nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 28 pounds per day (around 840 pounds per month). There are no BOD TMDL limits applied in winter from November 1 through March 31.  8   Water Quality IndicatorsSetting Priority for Restoration and Protection In Maryland's 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds were included in two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and priority for protecting valued resources. As the basis for the 1998 prioritization, a Unified Watershed Assessment was conducted to establish priorities for restoration and protection all for all watersheds (134) covering the State of Maryland. Part of this assessment employed indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources for each watershed where sufficient information was available. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do Water Quality Indicator Summary not look comparatively at watersheds Coastal Bay Tidal Index as the Unified Assessment did in an Watershed effort to set priorities. The Unified Habitat Eutrophication Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape Assawoman Category 1 Category 2 indicators described in the following Isle of Wight Category 1 Category 2 sections. The Coastal Bays watersheds, Sinepuxent Category 2 Category 2 the table summarizes the rankings for the water quality indicators used to Newport Category 1 Category 2 allow comparison among them. The Chincoteague Category 2 Category 2 definition each category is listed below: Category 1  watersheds in this category have the greatest problems compared to other watersheds. These watersheds are assigned the highest priority for restoration. Category 2  watersheds that do not have conditions to qualify for either Category 1 or Category 3. Both restoration and protection would be addressed in these watersheds as practicable. Category 3  watersheds with relatively very few problems and high quality conditions. These watershed are assigned the highest priority for protection.  9   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  10   Water Quality Monitoring Various agencies conduct on-going water quality-related monitoring in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area, including DNR, MDE, the National Park Service and volunteers working with Maryland's Coastal Bays Program. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows some of these monitoring stations (mostly those used for the Newport Bay TMDL). Maryland's Coastal Bays Program distributes information relevant to the WRAS Project via the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/coastalbays/index.html . An example of the information available under the heading Water Quality is shown below. The Internet site offers other information like analysis of data from the four fixed monitoring stations listed below and labeled on Map 4. Ayer Creek at Rt. 376 - AYR0017 Trappe Creek at Saddle Creek - TRC0043 Newport Bay near Newport Neck - XCM4878 Marshall Creek east of Rick's Point - MSL0011  11   Water Quality Analysis 1. Algae 7 To estimate relative population levels of green and blue-green algae present in a water body, the concentration of Chlorophyll a in water is used as an indirect estimate of the aggregate population. Higher Chlorophyll a concentrations indicate higher algae populations. Algae problems tend to occur more in Trappe, Ayer and Newport Creeks rather than the open tidal waters of Newport Bay itself based on 1998 data. In Newport Bay, Chlorophyll a concentrations were 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) or less under high flow (spring) and low flow (summer) conditions. The greatest algae populations were found in Trappe Creek where chlorophyll a concentrations from 100 to 200 Fg/l occurred during low flow conditions. Under high flow conditions in Trappe Creek, chlorophyll a concentrations as high as 125 Fg/l were measured. Ayer Creek and Newport Creek both exhibited elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during low flow conditions up to 125 Fg/l and up to 90 Fg/l respectively. In Kitts Branch, chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently less than 40 Fg/l which indicates that algae is not a problem in this tributary. Overall, the 1998 data suggests that the algae problem is related to conditions arising up in the watershed rather than from problems arising from tidal inputs from Sinepuxent or Chincoteague Bay. 2. Dissolved Oxygen During spring high flow conditions, all the tidal waters monitored during 1998 exhibited dissolved oxygen concentrations that were consistent with the State water quality standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l).7 During summer months dissolved oxygen below the State standard was found in several areas:  In Newport Bay, Newport Creek, Ayer Creek, Trappe Creek and Kitts Branch for all the tidal waters monitored in 1998. The lowest dissolved oxygen measurement, less than 2.5 mg/l, was observed in Ayer Creek.7  Throughout Newport Bay (1999 through 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Newport Creek and Marshall Creek (Aug. 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Sinepuxent Bay (DNR Fisheries Service, sampling typically below a depth of 4 feet)18 3. Biological Oxygen Demand 7 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of oxygen consumption associated with living matter including algae, bacteria, plants and animals. BOD at various levels occurs naturally in water bodies and is only considered a problem if it causes problems such as violation of the 5.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen standard. In most areas of Newport Bay system, low dissolved oxygen problems can be traced to algal activity and nutrients that feed the algae. However, 1998 monitoring of Kitts Branch found occasional low dissolved oxygen that was not accompanied by high algal activity. This suggests that BOD may be the cause.  12   4. Nitrogen In Tidal Waters 7 Excessive livels of nitrogen was Newport Bay detected in1998 monitoring of the T otal Nitrogen Loads Newport Bay mainstem and Ayer and Newport Creeks at sites shown on Map 4 Agriculture Monitoring Water Quality. 30% Forest 38% Modeling analysis conducted by MDE to support their TMDL work Urban determined that nitrogen is the limiting Atmosphere nutrient in tidal waters of the Newport Bay Groundwater system. This means that controlling 12% Point Sources nitrogen loads affecting tidal waters can 7% 9% 4% effectively limit algae growth. The relative sources of nutrient loads to Newport Bay are shown in the adjacent pie charts adapted from MDE's TMDL report for Newport Bay. For total nitrogen, about two-thirds comes from point sources and agricultural lands based on MDE's estimates. Less than one-fifth of the nitrogen load comes from sources that are not locally controllable (groundwater and atmospheric deposition). Overall, these estimates suggest that control of locally generated nitrogen loads would reduce the total nitrogen load reaching Newport Bay. 5. Nitrogen in Nontidal Streams 20 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured stream base flow and water quality in 17 nontidal streams discharging to Chincoteague, Newport and Sinepuxent Bays during the winters of 1999 and 2000. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows the USGS monitoring sites that were within the WRAS project area. USGS reports that the average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin is 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Previously, nitrate concentration in this area was assumed be 0.72 mg/l. They also indicate that the majority of their samples found nitrate concentrations higher than natural levels for stream base flow in this area which is 0.4 mg/l or less. This finding indicates that the nonpoint contribution of nitrate to the Coastal Bays may be more significant than previously believed. USGS also reports that base flow nitrate concentrations in streams ranged from below 0.5 to 5.28 mg/l as nitrogen. They found a significant positive correlation between the percentage of watershed area used for row crops and nitrate concentration. This finding indicates the nitrogen management for row crops is a significant contributor of nitrogen to the Coastal Bays. 6. Nitrogen in Groundwater US Geological Survey (USGS) reports that the dominant nutrients in groundwater for the Chincoteague Bay and Sinepuxent Bay vicinities are dissolved ammonia and dissolved nitrate. The highest ammonia concentrations, up to 23.4 mg/l as nitrogen, were associated with anoxic groundwater, i.e. well water with little or no dissolved oxygen. The highest nitrate concentrations, up to 15.5 mg/l, were associated oxic groundwater, i.e. well water that also contained dissolved oxygen. Nitrate concentrations ranged as low as 0.05 mg/l. These findings 13   came from monitoring of 28 wells during the winters of 1999 and 2000. The wells were drilled into the surficial aquifer and the underlying confining layer so that water level and water quality measurements could be taken at different depths. 20 USGS also sampled 388 wells in the Maryland Coastal Bays watershed to help map the distribution of groundwater nitrate concentration. Throughout most of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds, nitrate concentrations less than 1.0 mg/l were prevalent. However, several areas exhibited significantly higher nitrate concentrations. For example, nitrate concentrations in the 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l range characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. 7. Phosphorus The 1998 monitoring described above was also the basis for assessing total phosphorus. As shown in the pie chart, phosphorus from agricultural lands and point sources Newport Bay dominate loads to Newport Bay according T otal Phosphorus Loads to MDE's estimates. Groundwater and atmospheric deposition, which are Agriculture represented by ""0%"" labels on the pie 20% chart, are not significant sources of Forest phosphorus in the Newport Bay Urban watershed. Based on this assessment, 0% Atmosphere 67% essentially all sources of phosphorus are 0% Groundwater locally controllable. 5%  Point Sources  8% 8. Salinty Based on monitoring in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay in 2001 and 2002 during a study of macroalgae, the range of salinity in the two bays is similar, varying from about 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt.19  14   Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has become mutually interdependent by employing vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in quality of our water and other natural resources. 1. Point Sources Discharges from pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay watershed is presented in two forms  MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table and  Map 5 MDE Discharge Permits:  The Sinepuxent Bay watershed has seven surface water discharges and three groundwater discharges. Only one of these, the Visitors Center at the Assateague National Seashore, may contribute significant nutrients to the Bay. The groundwater discharges all involve land application of treated sewage affluent.  The Newport Bay watershed has 13 surface water discharges. The two most significant contributors of nitrogen to the Newport Bay system are the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant and Tyson Foods, Inc. Two lesser contributors are Kelly Foods, Inc. and the Newark Wastewater Treatment Plant. These four facilities may be affected by implementation of the nitrogen TMDLs in the Newport Bay watershed. The other nine surface water discharges in the watershed are not significant sources of nutrients.7  Kitts Branch, where BOD was addressed in the TMDL, receives effluent from several significant point source dischargers. Of these, Tyson Foods, Inc. is the greatest. A lesser point source of BOD is Kelly Foods, Inc. During cold-weather months, the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant, which discharges to Bottle Branch/Kitts Branch only during the months of November through March, is the second greatest point source of BOD. Characteristics of these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.  15   MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table  Page 1 of 3 Sinepuxent Bay Watershed  All Permitted Discharges (2/2003 data) Type / MDE Category Surface Water Discharge Water Treatment Sewage Effluent Industrial Gen.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. A. Nutrients According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nonpoint source (NPS) nutrients, particularly nitrogen, are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. On average for Newport Bay, 49% of the total nitrogen load arises from nonpoint sources (urban, residential and agricultural lands) and 80% of the total phosphorus load arises from nonpoint sources. However, the relative importance of nonpoint source nutrient loads varies significantly among subwatersheds of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area. For nitrogen, the Newport Bay watershed is dominated by nonpoint sources in all subwatersheds except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nitrogen loads. Phosphorus loads in all Newport Bay subwatersheds are entirely are nonpoint sources except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nutrient loads. B. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often interferes with these natural processes by attempting to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion 18   of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss). Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. These figures group together shoreline for both the Coastal Bays and the Chesapeake Bay drainage. 8 Worcester County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 919 (32%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 74 2 to 4 feet / year 26 4 or more feet / year 10  407  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Worcester County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve our ability to predict and address areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: St. Mary's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available.  19   Groundwater and Water Supply Groundwater is the source of nearly all water used for agriculture and business, and all potable water in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. In general, these water uses do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. Additionally, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land source to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Groundwater is the source of all potable water for all community systems in the WRAS project area. As shown on Map 6 Community Water Systems, several public water supply systems are located in the Newport Bay watershed and none are located in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Permit information is summarized in the table below.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that either tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the Year 2000 population density estimates. Summary of Coastal Bays Landscape Indicators Watershed Population Density (people/acre) 0.65 0.57 0.25 0.22 0.03 Wetland Loss (acre) 3,531 16,129 2,662 17,025 28,820 Unbuffered Streams (percent) 61 44 79 25 26 Soil Erodibility (value/acre) 0.13 0.23 0.13 0.08 0.13  Assawoman Bay Isle of Wight Bay Sinepuxent Bay Newport Bay Chincoteague Bay  Color Key: Green- benchmark met, conditions better than some other comparable watersheds. Orange- benchmark not met, condition is poorer than many other comparable watersheds. 1. Population Density The Year 2000 population density in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds was 0.22 and 0.25 people per acre of land respectively. A comparison with other watersheds in Maryland has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  21   2. Historic Wetland Loss The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are estimated to have lost about 2,662 and 17,025 acres of wetlands, respectively, over the years.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. 3. Unbuffered Streams Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds differ significantly on the extent of unbuffered streams, 79% and 25% respectively based on 1998 information. To develop this indicator, the presence or absence of forest cover adjacent to streams in corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side of the stream) was assessed. The estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees in stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees to create natural stream buffers enhances stream habitat. For this indicator, only streams that are shown on USGS Quadrangle maps are addressed. 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are both in the range of very low erosion potential as measured by the K factor: 0.13 and 0.08 respectively.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. Existing cropland management was not considered. The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  22   Land Use The table Land Use / Land Sinepuxent Bay Watershed Cover and pie charts summarize 2000 data for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds as Agriculture (11.34%) Developed (21.91%) categorized by the Maryland Department of Planning. Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover shows the Forest (31.37%) distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. Wetlands (23.31%) In general, the forest and brush cover the greatest percentage of land in Other (12.07%) both the Newport Bay watershed and the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads.  2000 Land Use  2000 Land Use Newport Bay Watershed Developed (10.99%) Wetlands (11.86%) Other (0.58%) Agriculture (33.93%)  Forest (42.63%)  23   Land Use / Land Cover Summary Table In Sinepuxent Bay Watershed and Newport Bay's Subwatersheds MDP 2000 Data, Acres / Percent Subwatershed Name / Number Sinepuxent Bay Trappe Creek Headwaters Newport Bay Ayer Creek & Trappe Creek Newport and Porter Creeks Marshall Creek Newport Bay Total Ag 851 11% 1,262 33% 2,550 37% 3,523 33% 1,905 34% 9,240 Forest & Brush 2,354 32% 1,355 33% 3,164 46% 4,277 40% 2,813 51% 11,609 Developed 1644 22% 1,425 34% 386 6% 989 9% 192 3% 2,992 Wetland 1,749 23% 6 -774 11% 1,763 17% 687 12% 3,230 Other Land 906 12% 75 -3 -80 1% --158 Total Land 7,504 4,123 6,877 10,632 5,597 27,229  Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more nonpoint source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. Map 8 Impervious Surface Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds and the table below reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).10 The map shows relative average impervious cover for each subwatershed and it shows local concentrations of impervious coverage as darker areas. The map shows that the subwatersheds closest to Route 50 have the highest average impervious cover (Sinepuxent Bay, Trappe Creek Headwaters, Ayer and Trappe Creeks). The subwatersheds south of Berlin have very low average impervious surface. 24   Map 9 Impervious Cover Town of Berlin Vicinity shows the distribution of impervious surface around the most developed portion of the Newport Bay watershed. At this scale, it is possible to see that the majority of the area has little impervious surface. However, concentrations of impervious cover in and around Berlin and adjacent to major roads may have significant affect on local waterways. The findings presented in the maps suggest potential directions for watershed management activities:  Large areas of the WRAS project watershed probably have very little impact from impervious surfaces. These areas could be prioritized for controls on new impervious surface or other forms of protection. In these areas, if any restoration action is needed, relatively limited restoration projects may be able to eliminate impacts associated with impervious surfaces.  Limited areas near Berlin and major roads, where impervious surface is concentrated, could be prioritized for protects like stormwater infiltration retrofits.

These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:9 Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  25   Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors, using several GIS data layers to identify hubs that contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare coldwater or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This ""Green Infrastructure"" provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. For more information on the Green Infrastructure identification project in Maryland, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gi.html Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Map 10 Green Infrastructure shows that, even from the statewide perspective that guided the analysis, there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds:  Numerous Green Infrastructure hubs are in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  Assateague Island is the only Green Infrastructure hub where natural resource values are protected. Other Green Infrastructure hubs are not protected. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 11 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 11 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance.  26   Protected Lands For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" is any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or low impact recreational uses or, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or limits use through an easement. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection.

Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Map 13 Soils shows soil variation in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The table and pie chart summarized information from the map.

Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map13 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions:  Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover  Map 10 Green Infrastructure Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. Once areas of interest are targeted and landowner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites. Floodplains And Low Elevation Areas Subject To Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately one foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Complete coverage of Worcester County including the Sinepuxent and Newport Bay has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts. Map 14 Floodplains shows the 100-year floodplain extending over a majority of the land near open water in the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay. Small areas of floodplain also occur along the tributaries to Trappe Creek in the vicinity of the Town of Berlin. As sea level rises and land development increases, the 100-year floodplain is likely to expand putting more infrastructure and resources at risk from permanent inundation and flooding.  29   Wetlands 1. Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, palustrine wetlands are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net increase of wetland acreage in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed over the past 11 years. A small net decrease occurred in the Newport Bay watershed. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section.  30   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Newport Bay/Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 11 Basin Code 02130104 Watershed Sinepuxent Bay Permanent Impacts -3.67 Permittee Mitigation 3.11 Programmatic Gains 3.00 Other Gains 0.09 Net 2.53  02130105 Newport Bay -4.80 3.45 0.50 0.80 -0.05 Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 15 Wetlands and the table below summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the WRAS area. In the Newport Bay watershed, 94% of wetlands are emergent estuarine or forested palustrine. The Sinepuxent Bay watershed is dominated by three wetland types: estuarine emergent 43%, unconsolidated shore (beach) 40% and forested palustrine 11%.

The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The living resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation, because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association Nontidal Benthic Index 3.2 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, Only one Living Resource Indicator was improvements for living resources offer developed for the Newport Bay watershed in the potential goals, objectives and opportunities Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified to gauge progress in watershed restoration.

For used to gauge local conditions for water comparison with similar Maryland watersheds, quality, habitat, etc. This second the benchmark for this indicator was not met. perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicator for the Newport Bay watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites, which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some indicators represent indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Newport Bay Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  32   1. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 3.2, the Newport Bay watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. Fish and Oysters Fish in Kitts Branch  MBSS 2001 Data 1. Fish In Nontidal Streams Information on fish in nontidal streams has been gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) for one stream in the Newport Bay watershed. The table shows that all the fish species identified are either tolerant or moderately tolerant of pollution and/or poor habitat conditions. The ranking of pollution tolerance is taken from work associated with MBSS.15 Tolerant Species Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions American Eel Bluegill* Eastern Mudminnow Moderately Tolerant Species Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Banded Killfish Inland Silverside Largemouth Bass* Mosquitofish  Pumpkinseed 2.

Yates conducted between 1906 and 1912. As shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status, about half of one 129-acre historic oyster bed was located within Newport Bay as it is currently delineated.17 Currently, no legally designated oyster beds are located in Maryland's Coastal Bays, including Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. Oyster lease areas are currently located in the Assawoman Bay, Sinepuxent Bay and Chincoteague Bay. The only oyster lease in the WRAS area, in Sinepuxent Bay, covers about 1.5 acres as shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status.  33   3. Tidal Fisheries Immediately available information on tidal fisheries does not segregate data on Newport Bay or Sinepuxent Bay. However, the following information that represents all of Maryland's Coastal Bays can be used as a frame of reference for the WRAS project area:  Blue crabs comprise the most valuable commercial fishery product from Maryland's Coastal Bays. Due to high salinity in these bays, blue crabs are relatively small compared to their Chesapeake Bay counterparts. According to DNR trawl survey results, only 5% of the blue crabs inspected are greater than five inches across while 21% of Chesapeake Bay blue crabs are over five inches. 23  In 2002 surveys conducted by DNR, 80 species of fish were identified. In the prior 30 years of surveys, an additional 50 species have also been identified. Twenty of the species identified in 2002 included juveniles. The Coastal Bays serve as important nursery areas for these species. 23  Four fish species are highly abundant in Maryland's Coastal Bays: Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic silverside, spot and bay anchovy. These fish are important forage for other fish species that are valued for commercial and recreational purposes. 23  Adults of many fish species are seasonally common in Maryland's Coastal Bays: summer and winter flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, white perch, spot, black sea bass, tautog, eel and sharks.24  Recreational catches for some fish species are significant: summer flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, tautog, striped bass and black sea bass.24  Some of the important fish species in Maryland's Coastal Bays have declined in population over time. This has necessitated management the affects to address the decline:25  Between the early 1970s and 1999, a coastal bay forage index based on Atlantic menhaden, spot, bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside has shown a gradual decline.  Summer flounder has strict harvest controls that were set after severe declines in the late 1980s. Increases in recruitment are evident based on presence of coastal bay juveniles and increasing average size in the offshore population.  Atlantic croaker has exhibited variable population size that may be associated with weather conditions and harvest rate. Stocks are showing consistent improvement which is attributed to current restrictions and bycatch reduction devices in commercial nets.  Spot have declined substantially since the late 1980s. The causes of this change is not understood. Spot is valuable for both commercial and recreational interests and as a forage species for game fish.  Bluefish was a major sportfish as late as 1989 but has exhibited substantial decline since that time.  Black sea bass is at a low biomass level and is believed to be over-exploited. In the late 1990s, the average size in the population increased which suggests the potential for a trend toward recovery.  34   Benthic Macroinvertebrates In Nontidal Streams During the past 25 years, DNR has conducted biological assessment of selected stream sites in the Newport Bay watershed using three different methods. Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status shows sampling sites were data is available. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) samples stream conditions for fish, benthic population and habitat conditions. Rresults from this sampling are summarized in the table below. Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used other biological assessment approaches in nontidal steams known as artificial substrate samplers and rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. Information from these efforts is summarized in the text that follows. 2001 MBSS Findings in the Newport Bay Watershed Score Location Kitts Branch Bassett Creek / Tukesburg Branch Station # NEWP-116-R-2001 NEWP-110-R-2001 Fish 3.0 -Benthos 2.71 1.29 Physical ---  Key for MBSS Findings Table Index of Biotic Integrity Fish Benthic Physical Habitat Ranges for Index 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Very Poor 1.0 - 1.9 1.0 - 1.9 0 - 11.9 Poor 2.0 - 2.9 2.0 - 2.9 12 - 41.9 Fair 3.0 - 3.9 3.0 - 3.9 42 - 71.9 Good 4.0 - 5.0 4.0 - 5.0 72 - 100  * Additional details are available at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/streams/mbss/index.html  Click on ""Search Online Data"" (button on left); Enter ""Newport Bay"" or ""Sinepuxent Bay"" in dialog box for ""8 Digit watershed name""; click on search.  35   1. Bottle Branch at Harrison Road In 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at Harrison Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  fair Since 1978, DNR has sampled macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at the Harrison Road crossing using artificial substrate samplers. Assessment of the benthic community shows a significant improvement in species diversity and a shift in species type, which together indicate that conditions have improved at this site over the past 25 years. Most of the improvement has occurred since 1997. The data shows that there was a significant correlation between time and biotic index and taxa number, with both improving. The taxa number is the total number of genera found at the site at the time of sampling. It reflects the health of the community but a direct measure of the types of organisms and the number will increase with better water quality and better suitability for the organisms. The biotic index is used to detect organic pollution and its influence on the macroinvertebrate community. When it improves it means that there are more pollution intolerant organisms present and less pollution tolerant. The macroinvertebrate community showed that over the years the site has been sampled that the water quality went from the upper poor range to the lower fair range, which is considered a moderate improvement in the water quality. 2. Kitts Branch at Flower Road In 1990, 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Kitts Branch at Flower Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings. Comments listed with the data indicate that the stream channel was ditched and a discharge from poultry plant was evident:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  poor  36   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, and other invertebrates, that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the State and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to charismatic animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. The table, Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds, lists animals and plants of concern within the WRAS project area. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, three specific sensitive species overlays used by the State of Maryland are found in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are designed to serve as coarse filters. To allow for uncertainty pertaining to interpretation discrepancies, the polygons used on the map to depict these locations have been buffered. Accurate on-the-ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or those which are utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting specific ordinances in some cases to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species and habitat within their ownership.  38   Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland In The Newport Bay And Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds Scientific Name Animals Charadrius melodus Cicindela dorsalis media Haliaeetus leucocephalus Rynchops niger Sterna antillarum Plants Almus maritima Antennaria solitaria Asclepias rubra Carex silicea Cleistes divaricata Cyperus retrofractus Dryopteris celsa Eleocharis albida Eleocharis rostellata Fimbristylis caroliniana Fuirena pumila Gymnopogon brevifolius Ludwigia hirtella Panicum scabriusculum Polygonum glaucum Prunus maritima Scleria verticillata Sesuvium maritimum Spiranthes praecox Triglochin striata Common Name Piping plover White tiger beetle Bald eagle Black skimmer Least tern Seaside Alder Single-headed pussytoes Red milkweed Sea-beach sedge Spreading pogonia Rough cyperus Log fern White spikerush Beaked spikerush Carolina fimbry Smooth fuirena Broad-leaved beardgrass Hairy ludwigia Tall swamp panicgrass Seaside knotweed Beach plum Whorled nutrush Sea-purslane Grass-leaved ladys' tres Three-ribbed arrow-grass Status Md.

Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, one NHA is located in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. It covers the entire Assateague Island National Seashore. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potentially affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) As shown on Map 17 Sensitive Species, numerous WSSCs, totaling about 57 acres, are designated in the Newport Bay Watershed. These important and ecologically unique wetlands are mostly located between Bassett Creek and Porter Creek. There are no WSSCs in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in state law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an EA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  40   Seaweed / Macroalgae Macroalgae, commonly called seaweed, are the simple aquatic plants that grow in shallow high salinity aquatic environments like the Coastal Bays. A two-year study beginning in 1998 was the first to characterize macroalgae in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The random sampling technique used throughout the Coastal Bays of Maryland and Delaware, found that macroalgae are more abundant that previously suspected and that no significant difference in abundance among embayments was detected. A second study conducted in May, August and November 2001 and March 2002 assessed over 600 monitoring sites in Maryland's Coastal Bays returned several findings in the WRAS area:19  The objective of the study was to determine if there is a relationship between nutrient enrichment and the relative abundance of phytoplankton (associated with high nutrients), macroalgae (associated with mid-range nutrients) and SAV (associated with low nutrients). The study did not establish the presence or absence of a correlation. However, considering only the WRAS project area, its findings for Newport Bay (higher nurients and Chlorophyll a, less macroalgae and SAV) and Sinepuxent Bay (lower nutrients and Chlorophyll a, more macroalgae and SAV) are consistent with the hypothesis.  Red algae was the diverse group identified by the study. These algae are commercially grown as a source of ingredients for food, cosmetics and medicines. The most common group, known as red weeds (genera Agardhiella and Gracilaria), were well distributed throughout the bays in all season except for Newport Bay where their presence was limited to spring.  Green macroalgae was the second most diverse group found and sea lettuce (Ulva spp.) Was the most prevalent. It was generally distributed throughout the Coastal Bays and was most consistently found in Sinepuxent Bay and in embayments to its north. In Newport Bay, these macroalgae were consistently absent.  Brown algae was less diverse than the other two groups. Brown algae in some form was found in Sinepuxent Bay during all seasons but no genera was found year-round. In Newport Bay, brown algae is generally absent but appears in winter/spring in the south end of the bay.  41   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. In the 1930s, a disease nearly eliminated all SAV Acreage for Selected Years SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays. Since about 1986, in general there has been a steady increase in area Year Newport Sinepuxent covered by SAV beds. For example SAV acreage increased from 2000 to 2001 in most Coastal Bay 1999 52 1,925 Areas. However, a few areas including Sinepuxent 1998 66 1,463 Bay experienced a decrease in SAV acreage from 2000 to 2001. Coverage in Sinepuxent Bay 1997 68 1,264 decreased approximately 2 percent from 2000 to a total of 1,654 acres in 2001.13 1996 19 1,058 The size of SAV beds in Sinepuxent Bay has 1995 23 718 been generally consistent with the Coastal Bayswide trend toward increasing acreage covered based 1989 0 425 on data collected since1989 as shown in the adjacent table. Map 18 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation also shows the difference in area covered in 1989 versus 1999. In Newport Bay, the adjacent table shows that SAV beds have covered a relatively small acreage and the trend toward increasing acreage is less pronounced. In general, SAV beds large enough to be identified via aerial photography have always been limited to the eastern bank of Newport Bay. For additional information, also see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/sav/index.html .  42   RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION TARGETING There are a number of programs and tools available to assist in implementing goals for protection of valued watershed resources and for targeting restoration of those that have become degraded or otherwise function less than optimally. Some of these tools are described below. 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Worcester County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to document potential problems and restoration opportunities associated with the issues listed in the table below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings include nutrient loads at each sampling site and allow the ranking of subwatersheds based on the nutrient load estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 43   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Worcester County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the best management practices identified in Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans for implementation on individual farms include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Worcester SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Boat maintenance and operation also can contribute petroleum and other noxious materials to the aquatic environment. According to DNR's Marina database, there are 24 marinas in Worcester County. One marina serves Newport Bay and four serve Sinepuxent Bay. Map 19 Marinas shows their approximate location. Curently, pumpout facilities are provided by one marina within the Sinepuxent Bay watershed and several marinas close to the WRAS project area. Two of the marinas in Worcester County currently participate in Maryland's Clean Marina Program but none of these are in the WRAS project area. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. Fish Blockage Identification Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will be the first accounting of blockages to fish movement that may exist in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  44   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Progress In the Coastal Bays Watersheds 22 As shown on Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario, stream buffer plantings have occurred at no fewer than 10 project areas between 1996 and the end of 2001 in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Both the mapped information and the summary table below are drawn from a database maintained by the DNR Forest Service.

Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  45   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. For many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use.

DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay drainage, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream 46    Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands that are adjacent to streams, that are composed of hydric soil, that are used for crops or pasture and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Restoration of stream buffers in these areas are would be most likely to intercept nitrogen, control sediment and phosphorus movement, and improve stream water quality and habitat in general. Additional assessment and field evaluation should be used to determine land owner interest, the practical implications of creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in areas identified and to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities. For example, some areas identified on the map (north and east of Berlin) appear to be dense networks of ditching to serve agricultural fields. Creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in such areas is probably only practical if the land owner is no longer interested in using the area for crops. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements.  47   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. In early 2004, the Maryland Department of the Environment will release an extensive assessment of wetland restoration opportunities in a report to be entitled ""Prioirty Areas for Wetland Restoration, Preservation, and Mitigation in Maryland's Coastal Bays"".26 It is anticipated that MDE's work will offer a number of ways to approach the issue of preventing loss of wetlands and enhancing wetland resources in and around the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Using already available data, one approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites uses GIS to help identify ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there appears to be potential for wetland restoration based on identifying crop land and/or pasture on hydric soil within 50 of existing wetlands. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map scenario are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (SSURGO), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario.  Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.  48   REFERENCES 1.

The Town is an incorporated municipality and is the county seat of Queen Anne's County, Maryland. In the WRAS project, the Town of Centreville is working closely with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders to consider local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 25,300 acres including nearly 1,400 acres of open water. The Town of Centreville is located at the head of tide on the Corsica River. The lower, tidal portion of the Corsica River enters the Chester River near Town Point in the oligohaline salinity zone. Depths of the tidal portions of Corsica River range from 1-2 feet in the upper tidal waters to greater than 15 feet near its confluence with the Chester River. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field data to catalog issues and rate severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The Town of Centreville, with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders, will use this information to help assess the watershed and to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality The tidal portion of the Corsica River is mostly designated Use II for shellfish harvesting and the remaining tributary streams are Use I for recreation and aquatic life. Impairments to these uses include nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), fecal coliform bacteria which led to shellfish harvesting limitations, sediment, biological limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) and toxics (PCBs, Dieldrin and methylmercury) which led to current fish consumption advisories issued in January 2003. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) approved for both nitrogen and phosphorus in the Corsica River sets load limits for both nutrients. The TMDL reports that the primary source for both nutrients in the watershed is agriculture. The point source nutrients contribution is relatively small and is anticipated to be significantly reduced when land application of treated sewage effluent from Town of Centreville's Wastewater Treatment Plant begins in 2004. The Landscape Land in the Corsica River watershed is nearly 64% agricultural, over 28% forest/scrub shrub and over 7% developed. Wetlands identified by DNR comprise less than 0.5% of the landscape. The watershed has low population density (0.15 people/acre) and has little impervious cover except in and around the Town of Centreville.  vii   Natural resource lands of statewide or regional significance, identified as Green Infrastructure Hubs, occur in four areas. Connections between these hubs are mostly forest and agricultural land. Land protected from development encompasses 8% of the the Corsica River watershed including conservation easements, agricultural easements and County Parks/open spaces. About two-thirds of the watershed is prime agricultural land and about one-fifth is hydric soil. All other soils amount to about 13% of the watershed. Of the nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands that are identified in the watershed, about 81% are palustrine forested wetlands. Living Resources and Habitat Anadromous fish spawning areas for white perch, yellow perch and herring are identified in the Corsica River mainstem and three major tributaries. Nontidal fish species identified in the watershed are mostly tolerant and moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and habitat conditions. However, two intolerant species, roseyside dace and least brook lamprey, found in limited stream segments indicate that good water quality and good habitat conditions coincide in these small areas. Natural oyster beds that were documented shortly after the turn of the century in the Corsica River no longer exist there. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Corsica River has only been identified using aerial photography in a few limited areas near its confluence with the Chester River. Its most frequent location since 1990 has been in Middle Quarter Cove. The bald eagle is the only sensitive species tracked by Maryland that is currently identified in the Corsica River watershed. Restoration Targeting Tools Using GIS, potential opportunities for habitat protection, stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration have been identified. These computer-generated assessments supplement the field information being collected during 2003 in the two field assessments: the Stream Corridor Assessment which catalogs and rates conditions found along and in streams, and the Synoptic Survey that will contribute water quality data, including nutrients, and assessment of fish and benthic communities at selected sampling sites.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Centreville and Queen Anne's County Centreville, Town of Mike Whitehill Chester River Association Eileen McLellan Eastern Shore Land Conservancy Amy Owsley Queen Anne's County Commissioners Loring E.

The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Corsica River Watershed in Queen Anne's County, where the Town of Centreville, the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Corsica River Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Corsica River Watershed is located within the Chester River basin as shown in Map 1 Land Water Total Location. The Corsica River Watershed's geographic location entirely within Centreville and 23,903 1,395 25,298 Queen Anne's County is highlighted in Map 2 WRAS Project Area. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. DNR subdivides the Corsica River Watershed into three ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes as depicted in Map 2. The table Subwatersheds summarizes acreage statistics for these subwatershed areas. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues;  provide preliminary findings based on this information;  identify sources for more information or analysis;  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work; and 1    provide a common base of knowledge about the Corsica River Watershed for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations. Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Centreville and Queen Anne's County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Corsica River Watershed are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds In The Corsica River Watershed DNR and MDP 2000 Data Number 02130507XXXX 0395 Name ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed Area in Acres Description With Water 8,382 Land Only 7,053 All tributary areas that drain directly to the estuarine portion of the Corsica River Includes south and west portions of Centreville Includes north and east portions of Centreville Entire ""8-Digit"" watershed  0396 0397 02130507  9,384 7,533 25,299  9,560 7,491 24,104  3   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, efforts to protect water quality have focused on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 The Corsica River Watershed is assigned two uses: Use I: Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Aquatic Life - all waters not otherwise designated as Use II below. Use II: Shellfish Harvesting Waters - All estuarine portions of Corsica River except above Earl Cove Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Corsica River watershed includes waters affected by water quality or habitat problems associated with several issues: Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fecal Coliform Bacteria Sediment Biological Limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin and Fish Consumption Advisory  These impairments affecting portions of the Corsica River watershed are addressed below. Each water body listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4  4   1. Nutrients The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. According to the April 2000 report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River, impairment by both nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Corsica River. (Also see section on TMDL.) Nutrients can cause problems in the Corsica River for several reasons. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Corsica River either nitrogen or phosphorus can become too readily available. When this occurs under certain conditions with warm weather, sufficient light, etc., algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal, including human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. When fecal coliform bacteria levels are too high in tidal waters containing shellfish, harvesting is restricted to prevent consumption of contaminated food. Map 3 Designated Use and Use Restrictions, shows that portions of Corsica River are affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to Centreville are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" This restriction applies to all the waters of the Corsica River east of a line extending in a northeasterly direction from Wash Point (39E04'51.2"" 5   North Latitude, 76E06'42.2"" West Longitude) to Cedar Point (39E04'57.9"" North Latitude, 76E06'29.6"" West Longitude). These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because elevated fecal coliform counts are commonly found in this area of the River estuary. The elevated counts suggest the presence of contamination by animal or human waste. Restrictions are necessary because oysters and clams are filter feeders that readily absorb pathogens in animal or human waste. 3. Sediment The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment due to suspended sediments in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these suspended sediments were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Suspended sediment can cause water quality and habitat problems in several ways. Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. 4. Biological Impairment One segment of the nontidal stream Gravel Run in the Corsica River watershed is listed for biological impairment in the draft 2002 303(d) list based on poor ratings for fish and benthic organisms (population and/or habitat). In selected stream segments statewide, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. In the Corsica River watershed, one stream site appears in the list because of biological impairment. Gravel Run is listed based on 1995 sampling of the stream in the Town of Centreville. See the section on Maryland Biological Stream Survey Findings for additional details. 5. Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin, Methylmercury and Fish Consumption Advisory The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed as an impaired water body for toxic compounds because fish tissue sampling conducted in 2000 by MDE and the University of Maryland Center for Estuarine Studies found elevated concentrations of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Dieldrin. PCBs are listed as the cause for listing of the Corsica River area for impairment by toxic compounds. PCBs are a category of synthetic organic compounds that were widely used for several decades but they are now banded from use in the United States. Their resistence to high 6   temperatures and generally very stable chemical characteristics made them popular for use in high voltage electrical equipment like transformers including the type previously used in local electricity distribution networks. PCBs' stability and organic characteristics in the environment allow them to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. These compounds are associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. Dieldrin is mentioned in the 303(d) list as a toxic compound found in Corsica River area channel catfish tissue but it was not listed as a factor in the river's listing for impairment. Dieldrin is a synthetic organic herbicide that was once widely used but is now no longer in use in the United Stated. It is known to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. This compound is associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. The Fish Consumption Advisory for channel catfish in the Chester River/Corsica River area arose because of the elevated levels of PCBs and/or dieldrin found in the fish that were tested. Based on these findings, there is a risk that health problems could occur in people who eat these local fish too frequently. Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001 and an update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend that human consumption of channel catfish from the Chester River/Corsica River area be limited as described in the table below.

A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one approved TMDL directly affects the Corsica River watershed. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River was completed by Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) in April 2000 and was approved by US EPA in May 2000. It established Corsica River TMDLs for both nutrients as listed below. Nitrogen Phosphorus low flow TMDL annual TMDL low flow TMDL annual TMDL 1,379 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 287,670 pounds per year 202 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 22,244 pounds per year  These TMDLs mean that water quality impairment can be eliminated in the Corsica River if the total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus reaching the river are both reduced to this level or less. Collectively, these TMDLs are intended to meet two specific goals: a) avoiding harmful algae blooms (i.e., algae population density greater than 50 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of chlorophyll-a), and; b) maintaining adequate oxygen to support aquatic life (i.e. dissolved oxygen concentrations above of 5.0 mg/l as required by State regulation). MDE's computer model results indicate that nonpoint sources of nutrients are a most significant contributor as shown on the next page. The pie charts were adapted from MDE's report. In both cases, agricultural land is the largest nutrient source in the watershed. Based on the assumption that atmospheric deposition of nutrients is evenly distributed across the watershed, these relative load estimates associate nutrients arriving from the atmosphere into the land use type where they are deposited. To meet TMDL requirements, MDE anticipates two general approaches to controlling nutrients:  Nonpoint source nutrients will be controlled through existing programs, like implementing best management practices, and  Point source nutrients will be controlled at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  8   Nitrogen Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (4.00%) Urban NPS (4.00%) Forest NPS (6.00%)  Phosphorus Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (11.00%) Urban NPS (3.00%) Forest NPS (2.00%)  Ag NPS (86.00%)  Ag NPS (84.00%)  The allocations listed will be used by MDE in drafting NPDES permits for dischargers in the Corsica River watershed. For example, that the nutrients discharged from the Centreville WWTP, plus any other point sources in the watershed, must be less than the point source load allocations for the annual and the summer low flow load allocations. Based on the computer model results, MDE anticipates that point source low flow requirements can be met by applying NPDES permit requirements on the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant. The annual point source load allocations were based on projected maximum design flow at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant assuming biological nitrogen removal and chemical phosphorus removal. MDE intends to monitor progress toward meeting the TMDLs through routine monitoring and additional TMDL evaluations. The estimated annual nonpoint source loads for both the nitrogen and the phosphorus TMDLs were based on Year 2000 land use projections. Additional details on nonpoint sources are presented in table Average Annual Nonpoint Source Load Estimates.

In the Plan, there were two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and Water Quality Indicator Summary priority for protecting valued resources. Corsica River Watershed As the basis for the prioritization, From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment indicators of water quality, landscape and Indicator Name Finding living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches Modeled Load: TP 0.66 lbs/acre to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described Modeled Load: TN 8.63 lbs/acre below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. The Unified Assessment also considered a Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment looked at five water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 ""8-digit"" watersheds though not all watersheds had information to allow generation of each indicator. 1. Modeled Loads for Phosphorus and Nitrogen In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, it is estimated that the Corsica River watershed receives 0.66 pounds of total phosphorus (TP) per acre in the watershed and 8.63 lbs/acre total nitrogen (TN). The TN yield meets Maryland's 10   benchmarks for these nutrients used in the Unified Watershed Assessment but the TP yield does not. Two of the most important pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay system are the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, deemed this because of their contribution to excessive growth of algae, speeding the processes of eutrophication. To estimate how much TP and TN reaches the streams and how much of each is available for transport to the Bay, computer models are used. For the computer modeling used to generate the yield estimates reported in the Unified Assessment, the following information was used for the models: 1) monitoring data of point source nutrient discharges; 2) estimated nonpoint sources loads, based on 1996 land use and estimates of selected land management practices, and 3) consideration of other factors like deposition from the air. 2002 modeling conducted by DNR using 2000 data shows that the average yields for the Corsica River watershed are 0.759 pounds per acre annually of total phosphorus and 11.71 pounds per acre annually of total nitrogen. These load estimates may differ from the estimates used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for several reasons: changes in point source discharges and land use, and differing consideration of best management practices and septic system loads. An additional gauge of nutrient loads will be available in the results of the synoptic survey conducted in 2003. Water Quality Monitoring 1. Intensive Surveys 1992 and 1993 Intensive water quality surveys were conducted in 1992 and 1993 near the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge and downstream to the Watson Road Bridge. This data was not used in the Corsica River nutrient TMDLs because the geographic coverage was too limited to characterize the entire tidal area of the Corsica River.5 2. 1997 Monitoring for the TMDL Two water quality surveys were conducted in the Corsica River watershed in the summer of 1997 to support work on the TMDL at locations shown in Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. The summer represents critical conditions for the Corsica River. This is because there is less water flowing in the channel, higher concentrations of nutrients, and the water temperatures are usually warmer creating good conditions for algal growth. Data from these 1997 surveys was used to develop the nutrient TMDLs for the Corsica River.5 3. Long Term Monitoring in Tidal Waters Long term monitoring of tidal waters has been conducted in the Chester River at two locations. Similar long term water quality monitoring has not been conducted in the Corsica River. Based on interpretation of 1997 Corsica River water quality data, influence of the Chester River on Corsica River water quality conditions is not clear. Status and trends information for the Chester River long term monitoring stations is available on the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html .  11   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  12   Water Quality Analysis The water quality analysis presented here is based on two water quality surveys conducted in summer 1997 by the State of Maryland for the TMDL. This limited data set allows for identification of warm weather problems but does not provide a complete understanding of variability throughout the year. Locations referenced in this section are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. 1. Dissolved Oxygen Based on the 1997 water quality monitoring, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lower Corsica River from the mouth to Miller Creek were consistently higher than the minimum 5.0 mg/l standard which indicates good water quality. Upstream of Miller Creek dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly near or below the 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l) minimum standard. As dissolved oxygen concentrations decline below 5.0 mg/l, aquatic life has increasing difficulty respiring and must leave the area or face suffocation. Violations of this standard in estuarine waters, accompanied by high algae populations, indicate that poor water quality (eutrophic conditions) are present. 2. Algae Upper reaches of the Corsica River experience persistent season algae blooms. Based on the two water quality surveys conducted in the summer of 1997, chlorophyl-a concentrations in the Corsica River upstream of Miller Creek occasionally reached between 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) and 146 Fg/l. These chlorophyl-a concentrations indicate significant eutrophication existed in this part of the river. Downstream of Miller Creek, chlorophyl-a concentrations were consistently less than 50 Fg/l which suggests a relatively less significant concern for eutrophication. 3. Phosphorus Inorganic phosphorus concentrations measured in the Corsica River in 1997 ranged between 0.02 mg/l and 0.10 mg/l in most areas. However, in the vicinity of the Mill Stream Branch confluence with the Corsica River inorganic phosphorus concentrations slightly higher that 0.10 mg/l were measured. Though there is no water quality standard for phosphorus, concentrations higher than 0.10 mg/l total phosphorus are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication in estuarine waters. In the Corsica River downstream of Miller Creek, inorganic phosphorus concentrations of 0.05 mg/l and less were typical. This finding of lower inorganic phosphorus concentrations near the Chester River compared to upstream areas of the Corsica River suggests that the sources of the elevated phosphorus concentrations within the Corscia River watershed are more important than those potentially entering from the Chester River. 4. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations in the upper tidal waters of the Corsica River (upstream of Emory Creek) ranged from around 1.0 mg/l to over 3.0 mg/l based on monitoring conducted in 1997. The tidal waters around Centreville exhibited total nitrogen concentrations greater than 2.0 13   mg/l. Though there is no water quality standard for total nitrogen, concentrations of 1.0 mg/l and higher in estuarine water are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication. Between the mouth of the Corsica River and Emory Creek, total nitrogen concentrations for summer 1997 ranged between 0.5 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l. The concentrations of less than 1.0 mg/l suggests less concern about eutrophication in the lower tidal waters of the Corsica River. 5. Toxics In 2000, MDE collected fish across Maryland, including the Corsica River, so that their tissue could be sampled for contamination by toxic materials as described in the prior section Use Impairments and Restrictions. A 1999 report by the Chesapeake Bay Program listed the Chester River (including tributary areas like the Corsica River) as an Area of Emphasis.14 This designation means that available data indicate that there is significant potential for a chemical contaminant-related problem. The monitoring data used to support this finding was collected in the Chester River mainstem in the vicinity of the Corsica River in both water column and sediment sampling stations. However, none of these sampling sites were in the Corsica River. Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has been crisscrossed and made mutually interdependent by vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in water quality and other natural resources. Sources of water pollution, which are grouped into two broad categories point sources and nonpoint sources, and nutrient pollution loads associated with these sources are discussed below. 1. Point Sources Pollution arising from discharges through pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called point sources. Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The Corsica River Watershed has four permitted discharges, based on information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base. Summary information is presented in the MDE Permits Summary Table and on Map 5 MDE Permits:  The Corsica River's upper tidal waters and the lower Mill Stream Branch may have a localized impairment associated with the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) according on MDE's interpretation of 1997 water quality monitoring data. This interpretation arises because 1997 monitoring of these tidal waters found that dissolved oxygen concentrations fell below 5.0 mg/l under some conditions and that total nitrogen 14   concentrations ranged between 1.0 mg/l to 3.0 mg/l. No other facilities with MDE permits appear to be contributing to these water quality problems.  The Town of Centreville anticipates that land application of treated sewage effluent could begin as early as 2004. This change could significantly reduce point source nutrient contributions to the river. Characteristics of permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. This information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. a. Nutrients According to computer modeling presented in MDE's April 2000 nutrient TMDL report for the Corsica River watershed, nutrients from nonpoint sources dominate the average nutrient load to the river based on 1997 water quality data and projected land use data for the Year 2000:  15    Nitrogen from nonpoint sources accounts for about 96% of the entire nitrogen load to the Corsica River (268,211 lb/yr total nitrogen).  Phosphorus from nonpoint sources accounts for about 89% of the entire phosphorus load to the Corsica River (19,380 lb/yr total phosphorus). These nonpoint source estimates do not distinguish between naturally occurring nonpoint nutrients and those caused by human activity. Both types are accounted for in the load estimates. (Naturally occurring nutrient loads, also called background loads, are the loads that would be generated if the entire watershed was in undisturbed forest and no other human-generated nutrients were contributed through atmospheric deposition.) Given the current understanding of nutrient loads and related problems in the Corsica River, it is reasonable for WRAS partners to identify and prioritize projects with the intention of reducing nutrient loads for several reasons:  Elevated nutrient levels in the Corsica River, which is an indicator of eutrophication, may persist after upgrades to the Centreville WWTP envisioned in MDE's TMDL computer modeling. Elimination of the Corsica River's water quality impairments will likely require reduction of nutrient loads from nonpoint sources in the watershed.  Reduction of nonpoint source nutrient loads can be accomplished, in part, through existing programs that implement best management practices and through education of land managers. b. Sediment Nonpoint source sediment loads have not been estimated for the Corsica River Watershed. However, several current sources of information identify sediment as a problem:  The Corsica River is listed for impairment by sediment / suspended solids in Maryland's 303(d) list.  Phosphorus, which tends to be transported in association with soil particles, is identified as an impairment in the Corsica River. c. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often either inadvertently accentuates these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) The table Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary provides a brief overview of local conditions. 7  16   Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 95 (29%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 64 2 to 4 feet / year 12  7  4 or more feet / year 2  323  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Queen Anne's County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve the ability to predict areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: Queen Anne's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available but information will be shared with local jurisdictions and other interests when they become available. Groundwater and Water Supply In the Corsica River Watershed, ground-water is the source for all water supplied to community use. The Town of Centreville operates the only community water supply system in the watershed under MDE permit QA1967G002. The Town's wells are all in the immediate vicinity of the community that they serve as shown in Map 5 MDE Permits. Much of the town is close enough to the wellheads to potentially affect them so it may be anticipated that the wellhead protection areas will encompass the majority of the town.. In general, community water supply systems employ confined aquifers in order to avoid the potential of local near-surface pollution. Therefore, community wells are not likely to affected by near-surface goundwater nutrient loads.  17   LANDSCAPE Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and by soils, vegetative cover and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Corsica River Watershed from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the population density, which is based on Year 2000 Census data. Landscape Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment Indicator Name Year 2000 Population Density Historic Wetland Loss Unbuffered Streams Soil Erodibility Finding 0.15 people/acre 4,192 acres 37 % 0.32 value/acre  Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds 1. Population Density Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. Based on the Year 2000 Census, the Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. population density in the Corsica River Watershed was 0.15 people per acre of land. This is similar to the in the Unified Watershed Assessment estimate 0.17 people/acre based on 2000 population projections. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 2. Historic Wetland Loss DNR mapping indicates that there are nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands in the Corsica River watershed now. However, assuming that all nonwetland hydric soils in the watershed were once wetlands, the estimated loss of wetlands over the years is 4,192 acres. This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide.2 18   3. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 37% of streams in the Corsica River Watershed were not buffered with trees, based on 1998 information. Corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side) along streams were combined with forest cover to develop this indicator. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. The finding for the Corsica River watershed compares well with other Maryland watersheds.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks and vegetative cover for wildlife. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator, only streams that appear on USGS Topographical Maps, sometimes called ""blue line streams,"" were considered in this estimate). 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for the Corsica River Watershed is represented by what is known as the K factor, in this case estimated to be 0.32.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. This watershed's erodibility is moderate, although its ranking among all watersheds in the state was fairly high. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing cropland management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  19   Land Use / Land Cover  2000 Land Use The following table and pie Corsica River Watershed chart summarize 2000 land use / land cover for the Corsica River Watershed. Developed (7.23%) Wetlands (0.42%) They are based on categories Other (0.09%) established by the Maryland Department of Planning. Nearly 64% of the land in the Forest (28.37%) Corsica River Watershed is agriculture. About 28% is in some form of forest Agriculture (63.89%) and about 7% is covered with some type of developed or urban use. All other types of land together amount to less than 1% of the watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads. Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. Since this land use / land cover categorization was completed in 2000, significant land use change continues to occur in the watershed. For example, acreage to the east of Rt. 213 north of the Three Bridges Branch is shown as agricultural on the map. Some of this area was annexed by the town of Centreville several years ago and a housing development called North Brook now occupies some of this land.15 Land Use / Land Cover In Corsica River Subwatersheds Acres / Percent, MDP 2000 Data Watershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed (land only) Agriculture 3,968 56% 6,495 70% 4,809 65% 15,272 Forest 2,376 34% 2,370 25% 2,036 27% 6,782 Developed 633 9% 470 5% 624 8% 1,727 Wetland 76 1% 2 -22 -100 Other 0 22 -0 22 Total 7,053 9,359 7,491 23,903  Corsica River Watershed including open water 20  25,298   Looking at land use / land cover in the three subwatersheds of the Corsica River watershed, several characteristics can be ascertained from the map and the table below:  Corsica Direct Drainage subwatershed has the greatest percentage of forest and brush cover. It also has the greatest percentage of developed land even though it does not include a town center. Additionally, it has the smallest percentage of agricultural land use. Taken together, it appears that development is the least concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two.  Mill Stream Branch subwatershed has the greatest percentage of agricultural land and the smallest percent developed land even though in encompasses part of Centreville. This suggests that development is relatively concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two subwatersheds.  Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run exhibits a mid-range percent of each major land use / land cover category compared to the other two watersheds. It also encompasses part of Centreville. Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream without significant opportunity for stormwater infiltration into the ground. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more non-point source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. The table Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds shows the relationship between upstream impervious land cover and in-stream quality. These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:10  21   Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  Map 7 Impervious Surface Corsica River Watershed reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).11 The map is color coded to show the relative amount of impervious cover in various areas of the watershed. Overall, there is relatively little impervious surface in the Corsica River watershed. Each of the three subwatersheds have average impervious cover of less than two percent. In appears that impacts associated with impervious surfaces are limited to small localized areas. Some of the local concentrations of impervious surface are in Centreville and adjacent to major roads. These concentrations of impervious surface may be generally suited to stormwater management control. Stormwater management retrofits and other forms of restoration could be targeted to these areas. Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors collectively called Green Infrastructure. Hubs contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare cold water or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This Green Infrastructure provides the bulk of the state's natural support system and ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, 22   protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Within Program Open Space, the Green Print program helps to target funds to protect Green Infrastructure areas. Map 8 Green Infrastructure shows that there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Corsica River watershed:  Four Green Infrastructure hubs are identified in the Corsica River watershed.  Only a small portion of one hub has some form of environmental resource protection. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 9 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Corsica River Watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is probably large enough to provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 9 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance. Protected Lands Protected Land Summary Corsica River Watershed  Map 10 Protected Land shows the Acres % distribution of protected lands in the Corsica MET / ESLC Easements 810 3 River watershed. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" Agricultural Easements 909 4 includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed County Parks, 239 1 land use. This protection may be in various Open Space forms: public ownership for natural resource or Protected Land Total 1,958 8 low impact recreational intent, private ownership where another party acquired the Watershed Land Total 23,903 100 development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, and other approaches. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. The map also shows some land in the watershed is within a Rural Legacy Area. This land encompasses 564 acres or about 2% of the watershed. The Rural Legacy Area designation has 23   the potential to target Program Open Space funds to help protect additional land from development. Some of this land is already protected by easement and/or by County ownership. The land shown on the map that is not currently under easement or County ownership is open to land use change consistent with local zoning and comprehensive plan requirements. An additional area of land identified on the map is encompassed by the Priority Funding Area. Within these areas, State funding is more likely to be available in support of local development projects. This area closes about 1,441 acres which is about 6% of the watershed. These areas are one of several ways to anticipate where new development or redevelopment is likely to occur. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. Soils of the Corsica River Watershed 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Centreville and Queen Anne's County shows. This information has been summarized into Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups shows the distribution of natural soils groups in the Corsica River Watershed as described in the table below. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions are a useful element for watershed planning and targeting restoration. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups with the preceding maps Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover and Map 8 Green Infrastructure, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions. Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. See the chapter Restoration Targeting Tools for additional information.  24   Natural Soil Group Area Summary for the Corsica River Watershed Soil Group Description Prime Agricultural Soils Soils With Limitations for Farming B1a - Well drained, moderate erodibility.

Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic 25   vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, they are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Corsica River Watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net decrease of wetland acreage in the Corsica River Watershed over the past 11 years. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic 4,192 acre wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section. Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change For The Corsica River Watershed In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 9 Permanent Impacts -0.95 Permittee Mitigation 0.45 Programmatic Gains 0 Other Gains 0 Net -0.49  Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998. Only nontidal wetland changes are shown; tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented represents changes for the entire watershed. 2) ""Permanent Impacts"" refers to acres altered (e.g., filled, drained) under permit from MDE. 3) ""Permittee Mitigation"" refers to acres restored by a permit holder as required by terms of the permit from MDE. 4) ""Programmatic Gains"" refers to acres restored by MDE using fees paid into a compensation fund by a permit holder in lieu of undertaking mitigation himself. 5) ""Other Gains"" refers to acres of wetlands restored when not required as mitigation for permitted losses  26   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 12 Wetlands and Wetland Acreage Summary Table summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the Corsica River Watershed. Two wetland categories account for all of the wetlands in the watershed:  Estuarine wetlands of all types account for slightly over 7% of all watershed wetlands, and  Palustrine wetlands account for the remaining 93% of watershed wetlands. Forested Palustrine wetlands alone account for over 81% of all watershed wetlands. In comparing the wetlands map to Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover, it can be seen that many of the nontidal wetland areas are depicted as forest on the land use map. And most of the estuarine wetlands are not identified on the land use map These differences are simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. Similarly, most of the estuarine wetlands shown on the wetlands map are considered open water on the land use map. In the Corsica River watershed, differing perspectives on Wetland Acreage Summary Table counting wetlands are significant for Corsica River Watershed watershed management. From a land Wetland Class Acres use perspective, 100 acres of Estuarine tidal emergent 159 wetlands are identified by the scrub shrub 6 Maryland Department of Planning. unconsolidated bottom 4 From a habitat / regulatory unconsolidated shore 17 perspective, there are at least 2,592 Palustrine emergent 102 acres of wetlands in the watershed. flooded semipermanently 56 In the context of the forested 2,104 Watershed Restoration Action scrub shrub 54 Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve unconsolidated bottom 90 valuable water quality and habitat Total Wetlands (DNR mapped 2,592 functions that may not be provided wetlands) by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.) Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) None of the wetlands in the table above are subject to WSSC regulations. See the Sensitive Species Section.  27   Floodplains Flooding was identified as a local issue early in the WRAS project. Flooding of public roads crossing streams is a particular concern. Map 13 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100-year floodplain extends far up tributaries beyond Centreville. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these requirements may not significantly improve water quality or quantity problems that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately on foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Partial coverage of Queen Anne's County including the Corsica River has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts.8  28   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms in the Corsica River Watershed are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are associated with alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. In the Corsica River watershed, information is available for fish, oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation, sensitive species. However, other forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, and others should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association SAV Abundance 1.0 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, SAV Habitat Requiremts 3.0 improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities Nontidal Fish Index 7.9 to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Nontidal Benthic Index 5.8 Second, the status of selected species can be used to gauge local conditions for water Nontidal Habitat Index 4.3 quality, habitat, etc. This second Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds perspective is the basis for using living Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. resources as an ""indicator."" Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicators for the Corsica River Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some are indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  29   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator, which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were used: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was estimated using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance indicator was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs restoration"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Index For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored 3.0 for the Index, which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". The Corsica River watershed is among the lowest scoring half of watersheds statewide on this indicator. 3. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 7.9, the Corsica River Watershed met the benchmark set for the Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (fish IBI) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured: numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Each watersheds score is an average of stream scores within the watershed. These watershed scores were ranked 1 (most degraded) through 10 (best condition). A score of less than 6 does not meet the benchmark set for this index. A score of 6 or greater meets the benchmark.  30   4. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 5.8, the Corsica River watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. 5. Nontidal Habitat Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) The Corsica River watershed's low overall index of 4.3 for habitat biotic integrity suggests that this watershed has significant physical habitat concerns relative to similar Maryland watersheds. This rank corresponds to an Maryland Biological Stream Survey's score of 2.8 which is in the ""poor"" range. A rank less than 6 means that restoration is recommended. This physical habitat indicator is developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. It is based on several measures of in-stream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sampling visits. The habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to changes in watershed landscape. The physical habitat characteristics are measured, scored, weighted, and summed to calculate the indicator for each sampled stream. A low score, or a decline in score over time, reflects both natural disturbances and human-induced alterations of the stream habitat relative to minimally-disturbed reference sites. The mean habitat score for watersheds is reported on a scale of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition). The ranked scores were divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). Watersheds with the best conditions ranked in the highest three quartiles and, thereby, met the benchmark. The watersheds with the worst conditions ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) and ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Physical habitat conditions in non-tidal streams and rivers are influenced by land use and land cover patterns in the watershed, such as the destruction of riparian forests and increasing the area of impervious land cover. Other major influences are channelization, encroachment by livestock, and blockages to upstream/downstream movements of fish.  31   Biological Monitoring In Streams The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) sampled stream conditions in the Corsica River watershed in 1995 and 2000. Additionally, citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program, which is associated with MBSS, assessed the benthic macroinvertebrate community at several sites in the watershed in 2000. Results from these sampling efforts address three broad categories of stream conditions as listed below. The findings in each of these categories, which are each summarized on a separate map, allow comparison of stream conditions across the watershed:  Fish as summarized in Map 14 MBSS Fish Index  Benthic macroinvertebrates (benthos or stream bugs) Map 15 MBSS Benthic Index  Physical habitat Map 16 Physical Habitat Index  Table MBSS Findings for 2000 and 1995 Additionally, overall conditions in a stream or subwatershed may be interpreted by considering fish, benthos and physical habitat together. Several interpretations are offered below.  Conditions that underlie the indices are complex and apply primarily to a local stream segment. No streams ranked as good or very poor for all indices. Typically, a stream segment ranks as a mix of good, fair, poor and/or very poor for the three indices.  There is a tendency for good/fair conditions to be associated with watersheds with the least disturbance (natural vegetation, forest) and for poor/very poor conditions to be assoiciated with greater disturbance (impervious area, agriculture, construction sites). Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used a biological assessment approach in nontidal steams known as rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. The table DNR Rapid BioAssessment Data Summary lists these results.

Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc., that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  33   MBSS Findings for 2000 and 1995 * Corsica River Watershed Score Watershed/Stream Mill Stream Branch Station # QA-N-014-219-95 QA-N-014-204-95 CORS-106-R-2000 CORS-205-R-2000 Three Bridges Branch and Tributaries QA-N-079-308-95 QA-N-079-316-95 CORS-107-R-2000 CORS-108-R-2000 Gravel Run QA-N-042-116-95 Fish 4.75 4.5 4.25 4.75 3.75 4 3.5 4 4 Benthos 3 3 2.1 3.9 4 4 2.7 4.7 2 Physical 65 75 --59 59 --21  Key for MBSS Data Table Index of Biotic Integrity Fish Benthic Physical Habitat Ranges for Index 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Very Poor 1.0 - 1.9 1.0 - 1.9 0 - 11.9 Poor 2.0 - 2.9 2.0 - 2.9 12 - 41.9 Fair 3.0 - 3.9 3.0 - 3.9 42 - 71.9 Good 4.0 - 5.0 4.0 - 5.0 72 - 100  * Additional details are available at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/streams/mbss/index.html  Click on ""Search Online Data"" (button on left)  Enter ""Lower Monocacy"" in dialog box for ""8 Digit watershed name"" and click on search  34   Fish and Oysters 1. Tidal Areas Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters shows that at least three anadromous fish species are known to spawn in several streams within the Corsica River watershed:  Corsica River mainstem, Emory Creek and Three Bridges Branch: yellow perch and white perch  Mill Stream Branch: yellow perch, white perch and herring Natural oyster beds were historically found in the Corsica River as also shown in Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters.13 Currently, there are no oyster beds or oyster leases designated by DNR in the Corsica River. The closest oyster beds currently designated by DNR are in the Chester River mainstem immediately outside of the Corsica River as shown in the map. The closest oyster lease areas are in the Chester River well downstream of the Corsica River in the vicinity of Kent Island. The reasons why the Corsica River oyster beds disappeared have not been established but sedimentation is likely to have been a factor. 2. Nontidal Areas Information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See Biological Monitoring In Streams for summary information. Additional information on fish populations and related recreational activities will be incorporated as it becomes available. Maryland Fisheries Service does not monitor freshwater fish populations in tributaries to the Corsica River, in part, due to an absence of public demand. Public access for freshwater fishing is unavailable on Corsica River tributaries according to the Maryland Guide to Freshwater Fishing (1992). Sampling of fish populations was conducted in selected stream segments of the Lower Monocacy River watershed in 1995 and 2000 by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). A complete listing of fish species that were identified are listed in table MBSS Fish Species Findings For County Subwatersheds. While these findings are limited and they are aggregated by County subwatershed, they do offer some insights summarized below:  Portions of stream networks draining to Mill Stream Branch and Three Bridges Branch support Roseyside Dace and Least Brook Lamprey. These ""intolerant"" fish species require good water quality and habitat to survive in the long term.  The majority of the fish found throughout the Corsica River watershed are tolerant and ""moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and/or habitat conditions.  35   MBSS Fish Species Findings For Corsica River Subwatersheds Key For Color/Font Code* for fish species in the table below (white: no data) Tolerant Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions Moderate Tolerance Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Intolerant Fish that require good water quality and good habitat conditions  Key for table: U means that at least one MBSS site identified the presence of this species.

May 1997.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the Sate and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to well known animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Conservation Measures DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species, there are four Ecological Significant Areas (ESAs) identified by the State of Maryland in the Corsica River watershed. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are course filters that allow for uncertainty by incorporating buffers around habitat areas. Accurate on the ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting ordinances to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species List In the Corsica River watershed, the bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus is the only species tracked in Maryland's rare, threatened and endangered species lists. Additionally, at least one colonial waterbird nesting area is found in the watershed. In general, these species are located within area on the Sensitive Species Map labeled as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA). 38   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Corsica River Watershed Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) At least four ESAs are identified in the Corsica River watershed as shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species. Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Corsica River Watershed. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potential affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) No WSSCs are designated in the Corsica River Watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in sate law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  39   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 19 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and the adjacent table show SAV Presence in the Corsica River By Year that SAV has intermittently appeared in (Years not listed  No data Available) the Corsica River during the 1980s and 1980 and 1984 absent 1990s based on interpretation of aerial photography. 1985 near River Estates In 1985 and 1987, SAV appeared only on the north side of the river near 1986 absent River Estates.

In partnership with the Town of Centreville and Queen Anne's County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Corsica River Watershed during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in late 2003. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings will include nutrient load estimates at each sampling site and ranking of subwatersheds based on these estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 41   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Queen Anne's County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the conservation practices in plans include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Queen Anne's SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Fish Blockage Removal The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will identify blockages to fish movement that exist in the Corsica River watershed. Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. Marina Programs In the Corsica River watershed, the only marina listed in DNR's Marina database is Centreville Public Landing. According the information available from the database, this marina does not offer pumpout facilities and it is not participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand and pathogens. This type of discharge to the Corsica River probably contributes to the problems identified in the River associated with nutrients and bacteria. At this time, the relative contribution of boat discharges to these problems has not been quantified. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine waste, by-products and activities. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating.  42   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a time-consuming, expensive project. That is why computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) is used here to manipulate remotely sensed data can help save limited time and funds. However, it is important to verify these scenarios using field information like that gathered by a Stream Corridor Assessment. It is also valuable to consider other potential scenarios or combinations of scenarios to support prioritization and decision making. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers For many watersheds, headwater streams (first order streams) drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. Since the Corsica River Watershed has a substantial percentage of its headwater streams in interior forests, protection of these forests against impacts from development may be an important part of WRAS strategies, along with reforestation where necessary. 43   4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly as shown in the adjacent table. By restoring naturally vegetated stream buffers adjacent to lands Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates producing the highest By Land Use pollutant loads, nutrient and Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) sediment loads can be Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment reduced most efficiently. (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario focuses on the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 crop and pasture lands Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 within 50 feet of a stream and identifies stream Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 segments that lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater with a significant percentage of nitrogen entering streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil, that are crop or pasture land and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be 44   taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements. Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there is potential for wetland restoration based on identifying agricultural fields (crop or pasture) on hydric soil. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Maryland Dept. of Planning Data), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario. 45    Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.

It mandates a statewide assessment of watershed conditions and provides for development of Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRASs) for priority watersheds deemed in need of restoration Chesapeake 2000 Agreement watershed commitments. CWiC is a shorthand phrase used in the Chesapeake Bay Program. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, intended to address coastal non-point source pollution. Section 6217 of CZARA established that each state with an approved Coastal Zone Management program must develop and submit a Coastal Non-Point Source program for joint EPA/NOAA approval in order to ""develop and implement management measures for NPS pollution to restore and protect coastal waters"". Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, establishing a program for states and territories to voluntarily develop comprehensive programs to protect and manage coastal resources (including the Great Lakes). Federal funding is available to states with approved programs. A legal document recorded in the local land records office that specifies conditions and/or restrictions on the use of and title to a parcel of land. Conservation easements run with the title of the land and typically restrict development and protect natural attributes of the parcel. Easements may stay in effect for a specified period of time, or they may run into perpetuity. Department of Natural Resources (Maryland State) Environmental Protection Agency (United States) Ecologically Significant Area, an imprecisely defined area in which DNR has identified the occurrence of rare, threatened and/or endangered species of plants or animals, or of other important natural resources such as rookeries and waterfowl staging areas.

Maryland Geological Survey, a division in DNR. Natural Heritage Area, a particular type of DNR land holding, designated in COMAR. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the US Department of Commerce that, among other things, supports the Coastal Zone Management program, a source of funding for some local environmental activities, including restoration work. Non-Point Source, pollution that originates in the landscape that is not collected and discharged through an identifiable outlet. Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation Service, an agency of the US Department of Agriculture that, through local Soil Conservation Districts, provides technical assistance to help farmers develop conservation systems suited to their land.

Land adjacent to a stream. 2. Riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by gradients in biophysical conditions, ecological processes, and biota. They are areas through which surface and subsurface hydrology connect waterbodies with their adjacent uplands. They include those portions of terrestrial ecosystems that significantly influence exchanges of energy and matter with aquatic ecosystems (i.e. a zone of influence). Riparian areas are adjacent to perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines. (National Research Council, Riparian Areas: Functions and Strategies for Management. Executive Summary page 3. 2002) Submerged Aquatic Vegetation, important shallow-water sea grasses that serve as a source of food and shelter for many species of fin- and shell-fish. Stream Corridor Assessment is an activity carried out by DNR Watershed Services in support of WRAS development and other management needs, in which trained personnel walk up stream channels noting important physical features and possible sources of problems. Soil Conservation District is a county-based, self-governing body whose purpose is to provide technical assistance and advice to farmers and landowners on the installation of soil conservation practices and the management of farmland to prevent erosion. A short term sampling of water quality and analysis of those samples to measure selected water quality parameters. A synoptic survey as performed by DNR in support of watershed planning may be expanded to include additional types of assessment like benthic macroinvertebrate sampling or physical habitat assessment. Total Maximum Daily Load, a determination by MDE of the upper limit of one or more pollutants that can be added to a particular body of water beyond which water quality would be deemed impaired. Geographically-focused groups, appointed by the Governor, oriented to each of the 10 major Chesapeake Bay tributary basins found in Maryland. The teams focus on policy, legislation, hands-on implementation of projects, and public education. Each basin has a plan, or Tributary Strategy.

Designated uses of for all surface waters in Maryland (like shell fish harvesting or public water supply) are defined in regulation. Water quality criteria may be qualitative (like ""no objectionable odors"") or quantitative (toxic limitations or dissolved oxygen requirements). All the land that drains to an identified body of water or point on a stream. Watershed Restoration Action Strategy, a document outlining the condition of a designated watershed, identifying problems and commiting to solutions of prioritized problems.
