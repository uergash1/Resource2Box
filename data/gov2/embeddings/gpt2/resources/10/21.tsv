Many of these people remember this time as one of the  highpoints of their lives—a time of pride and dedication that they look back on  fondly.    They don’t want to look back  on those years as the time when they were  exposed to asbestos , the time when  their health was irrevocably ruined and their futures destroyed. But for all  too many of them, that’s what happened.    For decades, asbestos was  considered a “miracle mineral.” It was strong, fireproof, an electrical  insulator, and resistant to acids and other chemicals (1). It could be woven  into fireproof cloth, molded into half-round pipe insulation, mixed into  concrete, and formed into heat-resistant gloves, aprons, and coveralls. These  products were widely used in heavy industries, including  shipyards ,  refineries ,  and s teel mills .    These products were also  used in the  armed forces . In the Army and Air Force, asbestos was used in brake  and clutch pads installed in everything from tanks to jeeps to aircraft.  Asbestos was part of the insulation in housing and other buildings on military  bases, electric wiring insulation aboard military planes, and fire retardant  materials used by military firefighters and gunners (2).    In the  Navy ,  Merchant  Marine , and  Coast Guard , it was even more widely used, mainly as thermal  insulation aboard ships. Asbestos was considered so vital to the nation’s  security that the Navy issued specifications in 1939 requiring its use in newly  constructed naval vessels. Almost 300 different asbestos-containing products  were used in shipbuilding during World War II alone (3).    Much shipboard work was done  below decks, in cramped and unventilated engine and boiler rooms (2). These  enclosed spaces trapped asbestos fibers so that they floated in the air like a  white fog (3). Sailors and shipyard workers breathed that fog as they fought  and maintained their ships. They worked without respirators because they knew  nothing of the dangers of inhaling  asbestos fibers .    Now, decades later, thousands  of those sailors and shipyard workers have developed  asbestos-related diseases .  Some of these sailors and workers continued to work in asbestos industries  after their military service, as insulators or pipefitters or other craftsmen.  Still knowing nothing of the dangers they faced, these workers breathed  millions of asbestos fibers every day. It’s no wonder that so many of them  developed  asbestosis ,  asbestos-related cancer , and  mesothelioma .    But even those who left the  industrial sector for different lines of work were not safe, because they took  the asbestos fibers they had already inhaled with them.  Former sailors  and  workers whose only asbestos exposure was during their military service or while  working in a  Navy shipyard  have nevertheless died from mesothelioma. Even a  former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., died of mesothelioma in  January of 2000, possibly from asbestos he inhaled aboard a Navy ship (3).    The Navy refuses to compile  statistics for how many sailors have died from asbestos-related diseases (3).  But data from other sources claims that as many as 26% of mesothelioma patients  are former sailors and shipyard workers. They account for 16% of   asbestos-related lung cancers  and 13% of serious respiratory diseases (4).    Industrial asbestos  insulators, who worked under similar conditions to sailors and shipyard  workers, are 344 times more likely than unexposed people to develop   mesothelioma . About 94% of these insulators are likely to develop either mesothelioma,  asbestos-related lung cancer, or asbestosis (3).    Many former sailors and  soldiers admit they feel betrayed by the armed forces and the government they  served. There is evidence that the Navy knew of the dangers of  asbestos exposure   as long ago as 1922, when it recommended respirators for anyone working with the  fibers. Navy corpsmen were instructed in the dangers of asbestos in the late 1930s.  In 1943, the Navy set minimum working standards for shipyard workers exposed to  asbestos, requiring respirators and ventilation of dusty areas, but did not  enforce them. Workplace standards for active-duty sailors were not set until  OSHA set them in 1971. And the  Navy banned asbestos  on all ships constructed  after 1973, but violated their own policy until 1979 (3).    Although veterans who were  exposed to asbestos during their military service cannot sue the federal  government, they can apply to the VA for service-related disability and  benefits. But this can be a lengthy and difficult procedure, because veterans  have to prove that the damage to their lungs happened during their service  time. It can be extremely hard to prove something that happened so many years  ago, and fewer than one-third of the veterans who apply to the VA for  disability payments actually receive them (5).    They can also file civil  suits against the  asbestos manufacturers . But many of these former industrial  giants have gone out of business or filed for bankruptcy protection against the  thousands of  asbestos-related lawsuits filed  against them across the country (3).

(July 2008)       An  American Civil War reenactment  is an effort to recreate the appearance of a particular  battle  or other event associated with the  American Civil War  by  hobbyists  known (in the  United States ) as  Civil War reenactors  or  Civil War recreationists . Although most common in the United States, there are also American Civil War reenactors in  Canada , [ 1 ]  the  United Kingdom , [ 2 ]  and  Germany .

Civil War  veterans  recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. [ 4 ]  The  Great Reunion of 1913 , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  Battle of Gettysburg , was attended by more than 50,000  Union  and  Confederate  veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including  Pickett's Charge . [ 5 ]   Modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961-1965 Civil War centennial commemorations. [ 6 ]  Reenacting grew in popularity during the 1980's and 1990's, due in large part to the success of the 125th Anniversary reenactment near the original Manassas battlefield, which was attended by more than 6,000 reenactors. [ 7 ]  That year,  Time Magazine  estimated that there were more than 50,000 reenactors in the US. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Participation     See also:  List of historical reenactment groups            Reenactment at the  American Museum  in  Bath ,  England       American Civil War  reenactments have drawn a fairly sizable following of enthusiastic participants, young and old, willing to brave the elements and expend money and resources in their efforts to duplicate the events down to the smallest recorded detail. Participants may even attend classes put on by event sponsors where they learn how to dress, cook, eat, and even ""die"" just as real Civil War soldiers would have. Most reenactments have anywhere from 100 to 1,000 participants, portraying either Union or Confederate infantry, artillery, or cavalry forces. Some people, though uncommon, may portray Engineers or Marines. The 135th anniversary Gettysburg reenactment (1998) is generally believed to be the most-attended reenactment, with attendance estimates ranging from 15,000 [ 9 ]  to over 20,000 reenactors. [ 10 ]   Reasons given for participating in such activities vary. Some participants are interested in getting a  historical  perspective on the turbulent times that gripped the nation, particularly if they can trace their ancestry back to those who fought in the war. In some cases, if there are not enough Union soldiers present, Confederate soldiers are asked to change sides, or become  galvanized yankees , for the day/event. [ 11 ]   Although many periods are reenacted around the world, Civil War reenactment is, by far, the most popular activity in the US, [ 12 ]  with an estimated 50,000 Civil War reenactors as of 2000. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Categories of Reenactors   Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for  authenticity . [ 12 ] [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Farbs          An  American Civil War  reenactor talks about life in a typical army field camp. Hard-core reenactors would consider him ""farby"" because of his weight, as well as the modern cigarette he is holding.       Some, called "" Farbs "" or ""polyester soldiers"" [ 15 ]  are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. The 'Good Enough' attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. Blue jeans, tennis shoes, polyester (and other man-made fabrics), zippers,  velcro ,  snoods , and modern cigarettes are common issues.   The origin of the word ""farb"" (and the derivative adjective ""farby"") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961. [ 16 ]  Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of ""Far be it from authentic."" [ citation needed ]  An alternative definition is ""Far Be it for me to question/criticise"", [ 17 ] [ 18 ]  or ""Fast And Researchless Buying"". [ 19 ] Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German  farbe , color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined, [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  or the German  farbische , manufactured, indicating obviously modern items. [ 22 ]  According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of ""The Black Hats, CSA"" reeanctment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Mainstream          A mainstream Federal  artillery  reenactor.       Another group of reenactors often is called ""Mainstream."" These reenactors are somewhere between  farb  and authentic. They are more common than either  farbs  or authentics. [ citation needed ]   Most mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the early 1860s, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used ""after hours"" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Progressive   At the other extreme from farbs are ""hard-core authentics"" or ""progressives,"" as they prefer to be called. [ 24 ]  Sometimes derisively called ""stitch counters"", [ 25 ]  many people have misconceptions about hardcore reenactors, [ 26 ]  which spawn from a published book about hardcore reenactors,  Confederates in the Attic . [ citation needed ]  Hard-cores generally seek an ""immersive"" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the 1860s might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event. [ 27 ]   Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate ""reenactorisms"", such as buttoning only the top button of a uniform jacket/coat, or insisting that a vest, jacket, or coat must be worn over a shirt at all times. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Types of Civil War reenactments     See also:  List of historical reenactment events     There are five loose categories of Civil War reenactments. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Total immersion events (Events By Us For Us, or EBUFU)   Total immersion events are made up solely of authentic reenactors, who march, live, eat and act like actual soldiers of the Civil War. These events are usually not public, meaning that the public cannot come and watch (it is for the reenactors amusement only).     [ edit ]   Living histories   Living histories are meant entirely for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of the average Civil War soldier. This does include civilian reenacting, a growing trend. Occasionally, a spy trial is recreated,and a medic too. More common are weapons and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. These should not, however, be confused with  Living history museums . These outlets for living history utilize museum professionals and trained interpreters in order to convey the most accurate information available to historians.   Living history is the only reenactment permitted on National Park Service land; NPS policy ""does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.""  [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Public demonstrations          Public demonstration in a parade for the sesquicentennial of  Red Wing, Minnesota .       Public demonstrations are smaller mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public how people in the 1860s lived, and to show the public civil war battles. The battles are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.     [ edit ]   Tactical battles       Main article:  Tactical event       Tactical battles, which are not usually open to the public, [ 29 ]  are fought like real battles with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). They have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees, [ 30 ]  and so could be considered a form of  live action role-playing game . Tactical battles might also be considered a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Time Bandits   ""Time bandit"" is a term to describe a historian who uses reenactment as part of their research. Often, this type of work is not seen at public events, so much as it is seen at museums, at special encampments, or in special circumstances. [ 32 ]  Examples might be using a reproduction of a stone age axe to chop down trees to measure the effectiveness of the tools. Or it can be the re-building of a kiln and using it to see first hand how the work was carried out. Alternately, it can be reenacting the use of cave dirt to manufacture potassium nitrate to imitate the work done in 1861, to measure the productivity of the Confederate chemists and the economy of using slave labor versus child labor for this work. [ 33 ]  Time bandits are also used as a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Scripted battles   Scripted battles are reenactment in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that the were taken in the original battles. They are often fought at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original.     [ edit ]   Reenactment and media   Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like  Gettysburg  and  Glory  benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics. [ 35 ]   In a documentary about the making of the film  Gettysburg , actor  Sam Elliott , who portrayed Union General  John Buford  in the film, said of reenactors:          I think we're really fortunate to have those people involved. In fact, they couldn't be making this picture without them; there's no question about that. These guys come with their wardrobe, they come with their weaponry. They come with all the accoutrements, but they also come with the stuff in their head and the stuff in their heart.          [ 36 ]   At times, however, the relationship between reenactors and filmmakers has been contentious. Although reenactors for  Gettysburg  were unpaid, money was contributed on their behalf to a trust for historic preservation; however, some subsequent productions have offered no such compensation. Also, in some cases reenactors have clashed with directors over one-sided portrayals and historical inaccuracies. [ 37 ]  Some producers have been less interested in accuracy than in the sheer number of reenactors, which can result in safety issues. Finally, large movie productions, like  Gettysburg , can draw enough reenactors to cause the cancellation of other events.

Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the  Union Army 's repulse of two  Confederate  attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the  Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of  Middle Tennessee .

Braxton Bragg 's  Army of Mississippi  was defeated at the  Battle of Perryville  on October 8, 1862, he retreated to  Harrodsburg, Kentucky , where he was joined by  Maj. Gen.   Kirby Smith 's army of 10,000 on October 10. Although Bragg's force was up to 38,000 veteran troops, he made no effort to regain the initiative.  Maj. Gen.   Don Carlos Buell , the Union victor at Perryville, was equally passive and refused to attack Bragg.   Frustrated, Bragg withdrew through the  Cumberland Gap , passed through  Knoxville  and  Chattanooga , turned northwest, and eventually stopped in  Murfreesboro, Tennessee . His army, joined with Smith's  Army of Kentucky  and together renamed the  Army of Tennessee  as of November 20, took up a defensive position northwest of the city along the West Fork of the  Stones River . During a visit by  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  on December 16, Bragg was ordered to send the infantry division of Maj. Gen.  Carter L. Stevenson  to  Mississippi  to assist in the defense of  Vicksburg . The loss of Stevenson's 7,500 men would be sorely felt in the coming battle. Bragg reorganized his army, and Kirby Smith left for  East Tennessee . Bragg commanded two corps, under Maj. Gens.  William J. Hardee  and  Leonidas Polk , and a cavalry command under  Brig. Gen.   Joseph Wheeler . Considerable cavalry manpower and expertise were diluted from the young Wheeler's command when both  Nathan Bedford Forrest  and  John Hunt Morgan  were detached for strategic raids outside Middle Tennessee. Bragg had another disadvantage to deal witha virtual revolt of his senior generals, who petitioned Jefferson Davis to relieve him (in favor of Gen.  Joseph E. Johnston , the commander of all armies in the Western Theater). Davis refused to relieve either Bragg or the rebellious generals.   On the Union side,  President   Abraham Lincoln  had become frustrated with Buell's passivity and replaced him with Maj. Gen.  William S. Rosecrans , victor of the recent battles of  Iuka  and  Corinth . Rosecrans moved his  XIV Corps  (which was soon after designated the  Army of the Cumberland ) to  Nashville, Tennessee , and was warned by  Washington  that he too would be replaced if he did not move aggressively against Bragg and occupy eastern Tennessee. However, Rosecrans took ample time to reorganize and train his forces (particularly his cavalry) and resupply his army. He did not begin his march in pursuit of Bragg until December 26.   While Rosecrans was preparing in Nashville, Bragg ordered  Col.   John Hunt Morgan  to move north with his cavalry and operate along Rosecrans's lines of communications, to prevent him from foraging for supplies north of Nashville. The  Battle of Hartsville , at a crossing point on the  Cumberland River  about 40 miles (64 km) upstream from Nashville (north of Murfreesboro) was an incident in Morgan's raid to the north, before Rosecrans had the bulk of his infantry forces on the move. The relatively small battle that followed Morgan's surprise attack was an embarrassing Union defeat, resulting in many captured Union supplies and soldiers. The Union also engaged in a strategic cavalry raid. On December 26, the day Rosecrans marched from Nashville, a small force under Brig. Gen.  Samuel P. Carter  raided the upper Tennessee Valley from  Manchester, Kentucky . Until January 5, Carter's men destroyed railroad bridges and fought a few skirmishes, including a serious one on December 28 at Perkins's Mill (also known as Elk Fort). But none of the cavalry raids, Confederate or Union, had any significant effect on the Stones River Campaign.   The Army of the Cumberland marched southeast the day after  Christmas  in three columns, or ""wings"", towards Murfreesboro, and they were effectively harassed by Wheeler's Confederate cavalry along the way, which delayed their movements. Although Rosecrans had reported his army to have 81,729 effectives in Nashville, his force on the march was barely more than half of that since he needed to protect his base and supply lines from the harassment of the Confederate cavalry. The left wing under Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden  (14,500 men) took a route that was parallel to the  Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad , passing through  La Vergne  and south of  Smyrna . The center wing of 16,000 men under Maj. Gen.  Alexander McCook  marched south along the Nolensville Turnpike to  Nolensville , south to  Triune , and then eastward to Murfreesboro. The right wing of 13,500 men under Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas  moved south along the Wilson Turnpike and the Franklin Turnpike, parallel to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, then eastward through Nolensville and along the same route used by Crittenden south of the Nashville and Chattanooga. The separation of the wings was designed to launch a turning movement against Hardee at Triune, but when the Federal march began, Bragg moved Hardee back to Murfreesboro to avoid a confrontation.     [ edit ]   Murfreesboro and plans for battle          Limestone outcroppings in a cedar forest at Stones River National Battlefield, 2005       Murfreesboro was a small town in the Stones River Valley, a former state capital named for a  colonel  in the  American Revolutionary War ,  Hardy Murfree . All through the war it was a center for strong Confederate sentiment, and Bragg and his men were warmly welcomed and entertained during the month of December. It was located in a rich agricultural region from which Bragg planned to provision his army and a position that he intended to use to block a potential Federal advance on Chattanooga. Hardee noted afterwards that ""The field of battle offered no particular advantages for defense."" Despite this, Bragg was reluctant to move farther south, say to the arguably more defensible  Duck River  Valley, or farther north, to Stewart's Creek, where Rosecrans thought Bragg would defend. Sensitive to the political requirements that almost no Tennessee ground be yielded to Federal control, he chose the relatively flat area northwest of the politically influential city, straddling the Stones River. Portions of the area, particularly near the intersection of the Nashville Pike and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, were characterized by small but dense cedar forests, in places more impenetrable to infantry than the  Wilderness  of  Virginia . Short limestone outcroppings, separated by narrow cracks as if rows of teeth, impeded the movement of wagons and artillery. Hardee's Corps was initially placed in Triune, about 20 miles (32 km) to the west, Polk's on the west bank of the river, and a detached division from Hardee's Corps under Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge  on the low hills east of the river. None of the troops were ordered to construct field fortifications.   By the time Rosecrans had arrived in Murfreesboro on the evening of December 29, the Army of Tennessee had been encamped in the area for a month. By nightfall, two thirds of Rosecrans's army was in position along the Nashville Turnpike, and by the next day Rosecrans's army numbered about 45,000 and Bragg's 38,000. The odds were closer than those figures would indicate. Bragg had the advantage of the detached, but cooperating, cavalry commands under Forrest and Morgan, who raided deeply behind Union lines while Wheeler's cavalry slowed the Union forces with hit-and-run skirmishes. (Part of Rosecrans's reluctance to move from Nashville was the inexperience of his cavalry forces in comparison to their Confederate counterparts.) On December 29, Wheeler and 2,500 of his men rode completely around the Union army, destroying supply wagons and capturing reserve ammunition in Rosecrans's trains. They captured four wagon trains and 1,000 Union prisoners.   On December 30, the Union force moved into line two miles (3 km) northwest of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about 4 miles (6 km) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left  flank  was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked there when he arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, but he did not know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's  First Battle of Bull Run , both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, get into his rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.          Movements and positions the night of December 30 to December 31.       Bragg's forces were situated with  Leonidas Polk 's corps on the west side of the river,  William J. Hardee 's men on the east. He had expected Rosecrans to attack on December 30, but when that attack did not come, his plan was to drive Hardee's corps and the cavalry under Brig. Gen.  John A. Wharton  deep into the Union rear. He began moving the bulk of Hardee's corps across the river to his left flank in preparation for the next morning's attack. This left Breckinridge's division in reserve on the east side of the river on the high ground.   Rosecrans planned to have Crittenden cross the river and attack the heights east of the river, which would be an excellent artillery platform from which to bombard the entire Confederate line. Crittendenfacing Breckinridge on the Union leftfailed to notify McCook (on the Union right) of these troop movements. McCook, anticipating that the next day would start with a major attack by Crittenden, planted numerous campfires in his area, hoping to deceive the Confederates as to his strength on that flank, and to disguise the fact that his flank was not anchored on an obstacle (the nearby Overall Creek). Thomas, in the center, was ordered to make a limited attack and act as the pivot for Crittenden's wheel.   The armies bivouacked only 700 yards (640 m) from each other, and their bands started a musical battle that became a non-lethal preview of the next day's events. Northern musicians played  Yankee Doodle  and  Hail, Columbia  and they were answered by  Dixie  and  The Bonnie Blue Flag . Finally, one band started playing  Home Sweet Home  and the others joined in. Thousands of Northern and Southern soldiers sang the sentimental song together across the lines.     [ edit ]   December 31          December 31, 8:00 a.m.       At dawn on December 31, about 6 a.m., Confederate  William J. Hardee  struck first, attacking the Union's right flank with the division of Maj. Gen.  John P. McCown , before many in Union Brig. Gen.  Richard W. Johnson 's division had finished their breakfast. (This was the third major battle, after  Fort Donelson  and  Shiloh , in which an early morning attack caught a Union army by surprise.) The 10,000 Confederates who massed on their left attacked in one massive wave. McCook's deceptive campfires and the relative inexperience of McCown caused his division drift away to the left, which left a gap in the front, but the gap was filled seamlessly by the division coming up from his rear, under Maj. Gen.  Patrick R. Cleburne . These two divisions swept all resistance aside. Several  artillery batteries  were captured without having time to fire a shot. Johnson's division, on the right, suffered over 50% casualties. His neighboring Union division to the left, under Brig. Gen.  Jefferson C. Davis , was able to hold only briefly.   Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee drove the Union troops back three miles (5 km) to the railroad and the Nashville Pike by 10 a.m., where Johnson was able to rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden's attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with  Brig. Gen.   Horatio P. Van Cleve 's division crossing the river at 7 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had been slow to recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook would be capable of turning back Hardee's assault. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with blood from his friend and chief of staff, Col.  Julius Garesch , beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.          December 31, 9:45 a.m.       The second Confederate wave was by the Polk's corps, consisting the divisions of Maj. Gens.  Jones M. Withers  and  Benjamin F. Cheatham . What saved the Union from total destruction that morning was the foresight of Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan  (McCook's wing), who anticipated an early attack and had the troops of his division up and ready in the center of the right half of the line by 4 a.m. Withers hit Sheridan's right flank first (and Davis's left) but was repulsed in three separate charges. Then Cheatham, with his reserve division, hit Sheridan's front as Cleburne struck his flank. Cheatham's assault was sluggish and piecemeal; observers claimed he had been drinking heavily and was unable to command his units effectively. While Sheridan's men slowed the enemy advance, they did it at heavy cost to themselves; all three of Sheridan's brigade commanders were killed that day, and more than one third of his men were casualties in four hours of fighting in a cedar forest surrounded on three sides that became known as ""The Slaughter Pen"". By 10 a.m., many of the Confederate objectives had been achieved. They had captured 28 guns and over 3,000 Union soldiers.          December 31, 11:00 a.m.       Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on the east side of the river, did not realize that Crittenden's early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as reinforcements across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his frontso that  some  use could be made of his corpsBreckinridge moved forward and was embarrassed to find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike in his direction. He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.   By 11 a.m., Sheridan's ammunition ran low, and his division pulled back, which opened a gap that Hardee exploited. The Union troops regrouped and held the Nashville Pike, supported by reinforcements and massed  artillery . Repeated attacks on the left flank of the Union line were repulsed by Colonel  William B. Hazen 's  brigade  in a rocky, 4-acre (16,000 m 2 ) wooded area named ""Round Forest"" by the locals; it became known as ""Hell's Half-Acre"". Brig. Gen.  Milo S. Hascall  arrived in the Round Forest with reinforcements and decided the position must be held at all costs. [ 1 ]  Hazen's brigade, therefore, was the only part of the original Union line to hold. The Union line was stabilized by the strong leadership of Rosecrans and by the rallying of the divisions under Johnson and Davis. The new line was roughly perpendicular to the original line, in a small half oval with its back to the river.   Bragg planned to attack the Union left, a portion of the oval line facing southeast, manned by Hazen's brigade. The only troops available for such an assault were Breckinridge's, and Bragg ordered him to cross the river, but Breckinridge moved slowly. By 4 p.m., Breckinridge's first two brigades assaulted Hazen in piecemeal attacks and suffered heavy repulses. Two more brigades arrived, and they were sent in, reinforced by other elements of Polk's corps. The attack failed a second time. Thomas responded with a limited counterattack that cleared his front. By 4:30 p.m., the battle was finished.          December 31, 4:00 p.m.       Bragg's plan had had a fundamental flaw: although his objective was to cut Rosecrans's line of communication (the Nashville Pike), his attack drove the Union defenders to concentrate at that point. Bragg's biographer, Grady McWhiney, observed:       Unless the Union army collapsed at the first onslaught, it would be pushed back into a tighter and stronger defensive position as the battle continued, while the Confederate forces would gradually lose momentum, become disorganized, and grow weaker. Like a snowball, the Federals would pick up strength from the debris of battle if they retreated in good order. But the Confederates would inevitably unwind like a ball of string as they advanced.       That night Rosecrans held a  council of war  to decide what to do. Some of his generals felt that the Union army had been defeated and recommended a retreat before they were entirely cut off. Rosecrans opposed this view and was strongly supported by Thomas and Crittenden. Thomas has been quoted by different sources in the council meeting as saying either ""This army does not retreat"" or ""There's no better place to die."" The decision was made to stand and fight, and as the Union line was reinforced, the morale of the soldiers rose. Rosecrans was quoted after the battle as saying, ""Bragg's a good dog, but Hold Fast's a better.""   On the Confederate side, Bragg was certain that he had won a victory. Although he had suffered 9,000 casualties, he was convinced that the large number of captured Union soldiers meant that Rosecrans had lost considerably more. The Confederate army began digging in, facing the Union line. Bragg sent a telegram to  Richmond  before he went to bed: ""The enemy has yielded his strong position and is falling back. We occupy [the] whole field and shall follow him. ... God has granted us a happy New Year.""     [ edit ]   January 1 to January 3          January 2, 4:00 p.m.              January 2, 4:45 p.m.       At 3 a.m. on January 1, 1863, Rosecrans revived his original plan and ordered Van Cleve's division (commanded by Col. Samuel Beatty following Van Cleve's wounding the previous day) to cross the river and occupy the heights there, protecting two river crossing sites and providing a good platform for artillery. But the day was relatively quiet as both armies observed  New Year's Day  by resting and tending to their wounded. Polk launched two probes of the Union line, one against Thomas, the other against Sheridan, to little effect.   In the rear, Wheeler's cavalry continued to harass the Union line of communication on the turnpike back to Nashville. Convoys of wounded had to travel under heavy escort to be protected from the cavalry, and Wheeler interpreted these movements as preparations for a retreat, and he reported such to Bragg. Buoyed by his sense that he had won the battle, Bragg was content to wait for Rosecrans to retreat.   At 4 p.m. on January 2, Bragg directed Breckinridge's troops to attack Beatty's division, which was occupying the hill on the east side of the river. Breckinridge initially protested that the assault would be suicidal but eventually agreed and attacked with determination. The Union troops were pushed back across McFadden  Ford , but the Confederate charge ran into heavy fire from massed Union artillery across the river, commanded by Crittenden's artillery chief, Captain  John Mendenhall . Mendenhall deployed his guns perfectly45 arrayed hub-to-hub, completely commanding the opposite bank and heights beyondand saved the day for Rosecrans. The Confederate attack stalled, having suffered over 1,800 casualties in less than an hour. A Union division under the command of  James S. Negley  (Thomas's wing) led a counterattack at 4:45 p.m., and the Confederate troops retreated. Breckinridge was devastated by the disaster. He lost nearly one third of his Kentucky troops ( Hanson's  Brigade, also known as the  Orphan Brigade  because it could not return to Union-occupied Kentucky). As he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, ""My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans.""   On the morning of January 3, a large supply train and reinforced infantry brigade reached Rosecrans. Wheeler's cavalry attempted to capture the ammunition train that followed it but was repulsed. Late that evening, Thomas attacked the center of the Confederate line with two regiments in reaction to constant enemy sharpshooting against troops in his division under  Lovell H. Rousseau . Thomas drove the Confederates from their entrenchments, taking 70 to 80 prisoners. (Despite this action, the main battle is generally accepted to have ended on January 2.)   Bragg was convinced that Rosecrans would continue to receive reinforcements, and he knew that the miserable weather of freezing rain could raise the river enough to split his army. Beginning at 10 p.m. on January 3, he withdrew through Murfreesboro and began a retreat to  Tullahoma, Tennessee , 36 miles (58 km) to the south. Rosecrans occupied Murfreesboro but made no attempt to pursue Bragg.     [ edit ]   Aftermath   Total casualties in the battle were 23,515: 13,249 on the Union side and 10,266 for the Confederates. This was the highest percentage of casualties of any major battle in the Civil War, higher in absolute numbers than the famous bloodbaths at  Shiloh  and  Antietam  earlier that year. The battle was tactically inconclusive, although Bragg was traditionally considered to be defeated since he withdrew first from the battlefield. He received almost universal scorn from his Confederate military colleagues; only the support of  Joseph E. Johnston  and President  Jefferson Davis 's inability to find a suitable replacement saved his command. But a case can also be made that it was at least a strategic Union victory. The battle was very important to Union morale, as evidenced by  Abraham Lincoln 's letter to General Rosecrans: ""You gave us a hard-earned victory, which had there been a defeat instead, the nation could scarcely have lived over."" The Confederate threat to Middle Tennessee had been nullified.   Rosecrans spent five and a half months reinforcing Murfreesboro. The massive earthenworks ""Fort Rosecrans"" was built there and served as a supply depot for the remainder of the war. The next major clash, the  Battle of Hoover's Gap , also known as the Tullahoma Campaign, did not come until June, when Rosecrans finally moved his army against Bragg.   Part of the site of the Battle of Stones River and Fort Rosecrans is now  Stones River National Battlefield . It contains the nation's oldest intact Civil War monument, erected by William Hazen's brigade at Hell's Half Acre. The 600 acre (2.4 km) National Battlefield includes Stones River National Cemetery, established in 1865, with more than 6,000 Union graves.

The battle was the most significant Union defeat in the  Western Theater  of the  American Civil War .    After his successful  Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive, aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. The three corps comprising Rosecrans's army set out for Chattanooga by separate routes. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg's army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at  Davis's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans's army, defeat it, and then move back into the city. On September 17 he headed north, intending to attack the isolated  XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18, his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry, which were armed with  Spencer repeating rifles .   Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19, and Bragg's men strongly assaulted but did not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg continued his assault on the Union line, and in late morning, Rosecrans was informed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans created an actual gap, and Confederate  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet 's men promptly exploited it, driving one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field. Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  took over command and began consolidating forces on Horseshoe Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Although the Confederates launched determined assaults on Thomas and his men, they held until after dark. The Union retired to Chattanooga while the Confederates occupied the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

[ 5 ]  General-in-chief Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck  and  President   Abraham Lincoln  were insistent that Rosecrans move quickly to take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward  Atlanta  and the heartland of the  South . Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward  Nashville  and  Knoxville  and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between  Lookout Mountain ,  Missionary Ridge , Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer's Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position. [ 6 ]   Although Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee contained about 52,000 men at the end of July, the Confederate government merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner , into Bragg's Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg's army, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the  Knoxville  area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg's command who had little or no respect for the commanding general. [ 7 ]  Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  and Maj. Gen.  William J. Hardee  had already made their animosity well known. Buckner's attitude was colored by Bragg's unsuccessful invasion of Buckner's native Kentucky in 1862, as well as by the loss of his command through the merger. [ 8 ]  A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee's request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill , a general who did not get along with  Robert E. Lee  in Virginia. [ 9 ]  The Confederate War Department asked Bragg in early August if he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements for Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. [ 10 ]  He was also concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen.  Ambrose E. Burnside  that was threatening Knoxville. Bragg withdrew his forces from advanced positions around  Bridgeport , which left Rosecrans free to maneuver on the northern side of the Tennessee River. He concentrated his two infantry corps around Chattanooga and relied upon cavalry to cover his flanks, extending from northern  Alabama  to near Knoxville. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   River of Death   The campaign and major battle take their name from West Chickamauga Creek. In popular histories, it is often said that Chickamauga is a  Cherokee  word meaning ""river of death"". [ 12 ]  Peter Cozzens, who has written arguably the most definitive book on the battle,  This Terrible Sound , wrote that this is the ""loose translation"". [ 13 ]  Glenn Tucker presents the translations of ""stagnant water"" (from the ""lower Cherokee tongue""), ""good country"" (from the  Chickasaw ) and, ""river of death"" (dialect of the ""upcountry Cherokee""). Tucker claims that the ""river of death"" came by its name not from early warfare, but from the location that the Cherokee contracted smallpox. [ 14 ]  James Mooney, in  Myths of the Cherokee , wrote that Chickamauga is the more common spelling for  Tskma'g , a name that has ""lost any meaning in Cherokee and appears to be of foreign origin."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Opposing forces     Further information:  Confederate order of battle , and  Union order of battle            Commanding generals Rosecrans and Bragg       The Union  Army of the Cumberland , commanded by Rosecrans, consisted of about 60,000 men, [ 2 ]  composed of the following major organizations: [ 16 ]     XIV Corps , commanded by Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas , 22,781 present for duty with division commanders Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird , Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley , Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan , and Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds .

Van Cleve .   Reserve Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger , 7,372 present with one division commanded by Brig. Gen.  James B. Steedman  and an attached brigade of Col.  Daniel McCook .   Cavalry Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Robert B. Mitchell , [ 17 ]  10,078 present with division commanders Brig. Gen.  George Crook , and Col.  Edward M. McCook .     The Confederate  Army of Tennessee , commanded by Bragg, with about 65,000 men, [ 3 ]  was composed of the following major organizations: [ 18 ]     The Right Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham , Hill's Corps of Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Patrick R. Cleburne  and  John C. Breckinridge ) and the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  (divisions of Brig. Gen.  States Rights Gist  and  St. John R. Liddell ).   The Left Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman , Buckner's Corps of Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner  (divisions of Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart  and Brig. Gens.  William Preston  and  Bushrod R. Johnson ) and Longstreet's Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  John Bell Hood  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Lafayette McLaws  and Hood).   A cavalry corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Wheeler , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  John A. Wharton  and  William T. Martin .   A second cavalry corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  Frank C. Armstrong  and  John Pegram .     The organization of the Army of Tennessee into Wings was ordered the night of September 19 upon the arrival of Longstreet from Virginia. Prior to this, the corps commanders reported directly to Bragg. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign          Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign, August 15  September 8, 1863.        Confederate         Union         [ edit ]   Planning the Union advance   Rosecrans faced significant logistical challenges if he chose to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans would be forced to fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of ""recklessness, conceit and malice"" of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until the least August 17. [ 20 ]   Rosecrans knew that he would have difficulty receiving supplies from his base on any advance across the Tennessee River and therefore thought it necessary to accumulate enough supplies and transport wagons that he could cross long distances without a reliable line of communications. His subordinate generals were supportive of this line of reasoning and counseled delay, all except for Brig. Gen.  James A. Garfield , Rosecrans's chief of staff, a politician who understood the value of being on the record endorsing the Lincoln administration's priorities. [ 21 ]   The plan for the Union advance was to cross the Cumberland Plateau into the valley of the Tennessee River, pause briefly to accumulate some supplies, and then cross the river itself. An opposed crossing of the wide river was not feasible, so Rosecrans devised a deception to distract Bragg above Chattanooga while the army crossed downstream. Then the Army would advance on a wide front through the mountains. The  XXI Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden  would advance against the city from the west, the  XIV Corps  under Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  would cross over Lookout Mountain 20 miles south of the city, while the  XX Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Alexander M. McCook  and the Cavalry Corps under Maj. Gen.  David S. Stanley  would advance even farther to the southeast toward Bragg's railroad supply line leading from Atlanta. If executed correctly, this plan would cause Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga or be trapped in the city without supplies. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Crossing the Tennessee   Rosecrans ordered his army to move on August 16. The difficult road conditions meant a full week passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans's deception plan was underway.  Col.   John T. Wilder  of the  XIV Corps  moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at  Hoover's Gap ) to the north of Chattanooga. His men pounded on tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt.  Eli Lilly , bombarded the city from Stringer's Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the  Second Battle of Chattanooga . The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside's advancing  Army of the Ohio  from Knoxville. [ 23 ]   The first crossing of the Tennessee River was accomplished by the XX Corps at Caperton's Ferry, 4 miles from  Stevenson  on August 29, where construction began on a 1,250-foot pontoon bridge. The second crossing, of the XIV Corps, was at  Shellmound, Tennessee , on August 30. They were quickly followed by most of the XXI Corps. The fourth crossing site was at the mouth of  Battle Creek, Tennessee , where the rest of the XIV Corps crossed on August 31. Without permanent bridges, the Army of the Cumberland could not be supplied reliably, so another bridge was constructed at Bridgeport by Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan 's division, spanning 2,700 feet in three days. Virtually all of the Union army, other than elements of the Reserve Corps kept behind to guard the railroad, had safely crossed the river by September 4. They faced more mountainous terrain and road networks that were just as treacherous as the ones they had already traversed. [ 24 ]   The Confederate high command was concerned about this development and took steps to reinforce the Army of Tennessee. General  Joseph E. Johnston 's army dispatched on loan two weak divisions (about 9,000 men) from  Mississippi  under Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge  and Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  by September 4, and General  Robert E. Lee  dispatched a corps under  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet  from the  Army of Northern Virginia . Only two divisions of Virginians reached Bragg, of which only five brigades (about 5,000 effectives) arrived in time for the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Into Georgia   The three infantry corps of Rosecrans's army advanced by separate routes, on the only three roads that were suitable for such movements. On the right flank, McCook's XX Corps moved southwest to  Valley Head, Alabama ; in the center, Thomas's XIV Corps moved just across the border to  Trenton, Georgia ; and on the left, Crittenden's XXI Corps moved directly toward Chattanooga around Lookout Mountain. On September 8, after learning that Rosecrans had crossed into his rear, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga and moved his army south along the LaFayette Road toward  LaFayette, Georgia . The Union army occupied Chattanooga on September 9. Rosecrans telegraphed Halleck, ""Chattanooga is ours without a struggle and East Tennessee is free."" [ 26 ]  Bragg was aware of Rosecrans's dispositions and planned to defeat him by attacking his isolated corps individually. The corps were spread out over 40 miles (65 km), too far apart to support each other. [ 27 ]          Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863.       Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and fleeing to either  Dalton ,  Rome , or  Atlanta, Georgia . Instead, Bragg's Army of Tennessee was encamped at LaFayette, some 20 miles (32 km) south of Chattanooga. Confederate soldiers who posed as deserters deliberately added to this impression. Thomas firmly cautioned Rosecrans that a pursuit of Bragg was unwise because the Army of the Cumberland was too widely dispersed and its supply lines were tenuous. Rosecrans, exultant at his success in capturing Chattanooga, discounted Thomas's advice. He ordered McCook to swing across Lookout Mountain at Winston's Gap and use his cavalry to break Bragg's railroad supply line at  Resaca, Georgia . Crittenden was to take Chattanooga and then turn south in pursuit of Bragg. Thomas was to continue his advance toward LaFayette. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Davis's Cross Roads   Thomas's lead division, under Maj. Gen.  James Negley , intended to cross McLemore's Cove and use Dug Gap in Pigeon Mountain to reach LaFayette. Negley was 12 hours ahead of Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird 's division, the nearest reinforcements. Braxton Bragg hoped to trap Negley by attacking through the cove from the northeast, forcing the Union division to its destruction at the cul-de-sac at the southwest end of the valley. Early on the morning of September 10, Bragg ordered Polk's division under Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman  to march 13 miles southwest into the cove and strike Negley's flank. He also ordered D.H. Hill to send Cleburne's division from LaFayette through Dug Gap to strike Negley's front, making sure the movement was coordinated with Hindman's. [ 29 ]   Entering the cove with 4,600 men, Negley's division encountered Confederate skirmishers, but pressed forward to Davis's Cross Roads. Informed that there was a large Confederate force approaching on his left, Negley took up a position in the mouth of the cove and remained there until 3 a.m. on September 11. Hill claimed that Bragg's orders reached him very late and began offering excuses for why he could not advanceCleburne was sick in bed and the road through Dug Gap was obstructed by felled timber. He advised calling off the operation. Hindman, who had executed Bragg's orders promptly and had advanced to within 4 miles of Negley's division, became overly cautious when he realized that Hill would not be attacking on schedule and ordered his men to stop. Bragg reinforced Hindman with two divisions of Buckner's corps, which were encamped near Lee and Gordon's Mill. When Buckner reached Hindman at 5 p.m. on September 10, the Confederates outnumbered Negley's division 3 to 1, but failed to attack. [ 30 ]   Infuriated that his orders were being defied and a golden opportunity was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he heard the sound of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Final maneuvers          Lee and Gordon's Mills.       Realizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and, as he wrote in his official report""as a matter of life and death""began to concentrate his scattered forces. [ 32 ]  On September 12 he ordered McCook and the cavalry to move northeast to Stevens Gap to join with Thomas, intending for this combined force to continue northeast to link up with Crittenden. The message to McCook took a full day to reach him at Alpine and the route he selected to move northeast required three days of marching 57 miles, retracing his steps over Lookout Mountain. [ 33 ]   Crittenden's corps began moving from Ringgold toward Lee and Gordon's Mill. Forrest's cavalry reported the movement across the Confederate front and Bragg saw another offensive opportunity. He ordered Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  to attack Crittenden's lead division, under Brig. Gen.  Thomas J. Wood , at dawn on September 13, with Polk's corps and Walker's corps. Bragg rode to the scene after hearing no sound of battle and found that there were no preparations being made to attack. Once again, Bragg was angry that one of his subordinates did not attack as ordered, but by that morning it was too lateall of Crittenden's corps had passed by and concentrated at Lee and Gordon's Mill. [ 34 ]   For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. Bragg, learning of McCook's movement at Alpine, feared the Federals might be planning a double envelopment. At a council of war on September 15, Bragg's corps commanders agreed that an offensive in the direction of Chattanooga offered their best option. [ 35 ]   By September 17, McCook's corps had reached Stevens Gap and the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Yet Bragg decided that he still had an opportunity. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen.  Bushrod R. Johnson , he decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army out to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. The Confederate army was to move beyond the Federal left flank at Lee and Gordon's Mill and then cross West Chickamauga Creek. He specified four crossing points, from north to south: Johnson's division at Reed's Bridge, Walker's Reserve Corps at Alexander's Bridge, Buckner's corps at Thedford's Ford, and Polk's corps at Dalton's Ford. Hill's corps would anchor the army's left flank and the cavalry under Forrest and Wheeler would cover Bragg's right and left flanks, respectively. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Opening engagements: September 18          September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga.       Bushrod Johnson's division took the wrong road from Ringgold, but eventually headed west on the Reed's Bridge Road. At 7 a.m. his men encountered cavalry pickets from Col. Robert Minty's brigade, guarding the approach to Reed's Bridge. Being outnumbered five to one, Minty's men eventually withdrew across the bridge after being pressured by elements of Forrest's cavalry, but could not destroy the bridge in time to prevent Johnson's men from crossing. At 4:30 p.m., when Johnson had reached Jay's Mill, Maj. Gen.  John B. Hood  of Longstreet's Corps arrived from the railroad station at Catoosa and took command of the column. He ordered Johnson to use the Jay's Mill Road instead of the Brotherton Road, as Johnson had planned. [ 37 ]   At Alexander's Bridge to the south, Col.  John T. Wilder 's mounted infantry brigade defended the crossing against the approach of Walker's Corps. Armed with  Spencer repeating rifles  and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, Wilder was able to hold off a brigade of Brig. Gen.  St. John Liddell's  division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 4:30 p.m., considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew and establish a new blocking position east of the Lafayette Road, near the Viniard farm. [ 38 ]   By dark, Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. Buckner had been able to push only one brigade across the creek at Thedford's Ford. Polk's troops were facing Crittenden's at Lee and Gordon's Mill and D.H. Hill's corps guarded crossing sites to the south. [ 39 ]   Although Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area. [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Battle of Chickamauga     [ edit ]   September 19          Actions, morning of September 19.       Rosecrans's movement of Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas 's XIV Corps the previous day put the left flank of the Army of the Cumberland farther north than Bragg expected to find when he formulated his plans for an attack on September 20. Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden 's XXI Corps was concentrated around Lee and Gordon's Mill, which Bragg assumed was the left flank, but Thomas was arrayed behind him, covering a wide front from Crawfish Springs (division of Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley ), the Widow Glenn's house (Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds ), Kelly field (Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird ), to around the McDonald farm (Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan ). Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger 's Reserve Corps was spread along the northern end of the battlefield from Rossville to McAfee's Church. [ 41 ]   Bragg's plan was for an attack on the supposed Union left flank by the corps of Maj. Gens.  Simon B. Buckner ,  John Bell Hood , and  W.H.T. Walker , screened by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest 's cavalry to the north, with Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham 's division held in reserve in the center and Maj. Gen.  Patrick R. Cleburne 's division in reserve at Thedford's Ford. Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman 's division faced Crittenden at Lee and Gordon's Mill and Breckinridge's faced Negley. [ 42 ]   The Battle of Chickamauga opened almost by accident, when pickets from Col.  Daniel McCook 's brigade of Granger's Reserve Corps moved toward Jay's Mill In search of water. McCook had moved from Rossville on September 18 to aid Col. Robert Minty's brigade. His men established a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay's Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At about the time that McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed's Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest's Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook's men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville and his men were pursued by Davidson's troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped on the west side of Chickamauga Creek. Thomas ordered Brannan's division to attack and destroy it. [ 43 ]          Union troops advancing at Chickamauga, drawing by  Alfred R. Waud .       Brannan sent three brigades in response to Thomas's order: Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer's brigade moved southeast on the Reed's Bridge Road, with Col. John Croxton's brigade on his right. Col. John Connell's brigade came up behind in reserve. Croxton's men drove back Davidson's advanced cavalrymen and Forrest formed a defensive line of dismounted troopers to stem the tide. Croxton halted his advance because he was unsure of Forrest's strength. Forrest requested reinforcements from Bragg and Walker near Alexander's Bridge and Walker ordered Col. Claudius Wilson's brigade forward about 9 a.m., hitting Croxton's right flank. Forrest protected his own right flank by deploying the brigade of Col. George Dibrell, which ran into Van Derveer's brigade and came to a halt under fire. Forrest sent in Brig. Gen. Matthew Ector's brigade, part of Walker's Reserve Corps, but without Walker's knowledge. Ector's men replaced Debrill's in line, but they were also unable to drive Van Derveer from his position. [ 44 ]   Brannan's division was holding its ground against Forrest and his infantry reinforcements, but their ammunition was running low. Thomas sent Baird's division to assist, which advanced with two brigades forward and one in reserve. Brig. Gen. John King's brigade of U.S. Army regulars relieved Croxton. The brigade of Col. Benjamin Scribner took up a position on King's right and Col. John Starkweather's brigade remained in reserve. With superior numbers and firepower, Scribner and King were able to start to push back Wilson and Ector. [ 45 ]   Bragg committed the division of Brig. Gen.  St. John R. Liddell  to the fight, countering Thomas's reinforcements. The brigades of Col. Daniel Govan and Brig. Gen. Edward Walthall advanced along the Alexander's Bridge Road, smashing Baird's right flank. Both Scribner's and Starkweather's brigades retreated in panic, followed by King's regulars, who dashed for the rear through Van Derveer's brigade. Van Derveer's men halted the Confederate advance with a concentrated volley at close range. Liddell's exhausted men began to withdraw and Croxton's brigade, returning to the action, pushed them back beyond the Winfrey field. [ 46 ]       The land between Chickamauga Creek and the LaFayette Road was gently rolling but almost completely wooded. ... In the woods no officer above brigadier could see all his command at once, and even the brigadiers often could see nobody's troops but their own and perhaps the enemy's. Chickamauga would be a classic ""soldiers battle,"" but it would test officers at every level of command in ways they had not previously been tested. An additional complication was that each army would be attempting to fight a shifting battle while shifting its own position. ... Each general would have to conduct a battle while shuffling his own units northward toward an enemy of whose position he could get only the vaguest idea. Strange and wonderful opportunities would loom out of the leaves, vines, and gunsmoke, be touched and vaguely sensed, and then fade away again into the figurative fog of confusion that bedeviled men on both sides. In retrospect, victory for either side would look simple when unit positions were reviewed on a neat map, but in Chickamauga's torn and smoky woodlands, nothing was simple.

Woodworth [ 47 ]       Believing that Rosecrans was attempting to move the center of the battle farther north than Bragg planned, Bragg began rushing heavy reinforcements from all parts of his line to his right, starting with Cheatham's division of Polk's Corps, with five brigades the largest in the Army of Tennessee. At 11 a.m., Cheatham's men approached Liddell's halted division and formed on its left. Three brigades under Brig. Gens. Marcus Wright, Preston Smith, and John Jackson formed the front line and Brig. Gens. Otho Strahl and George Maney commanded the brigades in the second line. Their advance greatly overlapped Croxton's brigade and had no difficulty pushing it back. As Croxton withdrew, his brigade was replaced by Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson's division of McCook's XX Corps near the LaFayette Road. Johnson's lead brigades, under Col. Philemon Baldwin and Brig. Gen. August Willich engaged Jackson's brigade, protecting Croxton's withdrawal. Although outnumbered, Jackson held under the pressure until his ammunition ran low and he called for reinforcements. Cheatham sent in Maney's small brigade to replace Jackson, but they were no match for the two larger Federal brigades and Maney was forced to withdraw as both of his flanks were crushed. [ 48 ]   Additional Union reinforcements arrived shortly after Johnson. Maj. Gen. John Palmer's division of Crittenden's corps marched from Lee and Gordon's Mill and advanced into the fight with three brigades in linethe brigades of Brig. Gen. William Hazen, Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft, and Col. William Groseagainst the Confederate brigades of Wright and Smith. Smith's brigade bore the brunt of the attack in the Brock field and was replaced by Strahl's brigade, which also had to withdraw under the pressure. Two more Union brigades followed Palmer's division, from Brig. Gen. Horatio Van Cleve's division of the XXI corps, who formed on the left flank of Wright's brigade. The attack of Brig. Gen. Samuel Beatty's brigade was the tipping point that caused Wright's brigade to join the retreat with Cheatham's other units. [ 49 ]          Actions, early afternoon of September 19.       For a third time, Bragg ordered a fresh division to move in, this time Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart 's (Buckner's corps) from its position at Thedford Ford around noon. Stewart encountered Wright's retreating brigade at the Brock farm and decided to attack Van Cleve's position on his left, a decision he made under his own authority. With his brigades deployed in column, Brig. Gen. Henry Clayton's was the first to hit three Federal brigades around the Brotherton Farm. Firing until their ammunition was gone, Clayton's men were replaced with Brig. Gen. John Brown's brigade. Brown drove Beatty's and Dick's men from the woods east of the LaFayette Road and paused to regroup. Stewart committed his last brigade, under Brig. Gen. William Bate, around 3:30 p.m. and routed Van Cleve's division. Hazen's brigade was caught up in the retreat as they were replenishing their ammunition. Col. James Sheffield's brigade from Hood's division drove back Grose's and Cruft's brigades. Brig. Gen. John Turchin's brigade (Reynolds's division) counterattacked and briefly held off Sheffield, but the Confederates had caused a major penetration in the Federal line in the area of the Brotherton and Dyer fields. Stewart did not have sufficient forces to maintain that position, and was forced to order Bate to withdraw east of the Lafayette Road. [ 50 ]          Brotherton Cabin.       At around 2 p.m, the division of Brig. Gen.  Bushrod R. Johnson  (Hood's corps) encountered the advance of Union Brig. Gen.  Jefferson C. Davis 's two brigade division of the XX corps, marching north from Crawfish Springs. Johnson's men attack Col. Hans Heg's brigade on Davis's left and forced it across the LaFayette Road. Hood ordered Johnson to continue the attack by crossing the LaFayette Road with two brigades in line and one in reserve. The two brigades drifted apart during the attack. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade attacked Col. John T. Wilder's Union brigade in its reserve position at the Viniard Farm. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, also lost their cohesion during the advance. [ 51 ]          Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19.       Union Brig. Gen.  Thomas J. Wood 's division was ordered to march north from Lee and Gordon's Mill around 3 p.m. His brigade under Col. George P. Buell was posted north of the Viniard house while Col. Charles Harker's brigade continued up the LaFayette Road. Harker's brigade arrived in the rear of Fulton's and McNair's Confederate regiments, firing into their backs. Although the Confederates retreated to the woods east of the road, Harker realized he was isolated and quickly withdrew. At the Viniard house, Buell's men were attacked by part of Brig. Gen.  Evander M. Law 's division of Hood's corps. The brigades of Brig. Gens.  Jerome B. Robertson  and  Henry L. Benning  pushed southwest toward the Viniard field, pushing back Brig. Gen. William Carlin's brigade (Davis's division) and fiercely struck Buell's brigade, pushing them back behind Wilder's line. Hood's and Johnson's men, pushing strongly forward, approached so close to new Rosecrans's headquarters at the tiny cabin of Widow Eliza Glenn that the staff officers inside had to shout to make themselves heard over the sounds of battle. There was a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. Wilder's men eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch. [ 52 ]   The Federals launched several unsuccessful counterattacks late in the afternoon to regain the ground around the Viniard house. Col. Heg was mortally wounded during one of these advances. Late in the day, Rosecrans deployed almost his last reserve, Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan 's division of McCook's corps. Marching north from Lee and Gordon's Mill, Sheridan took the brigades of Cols. Luther Bradley and Bernard Laiboldt. Bradley's brigade was in the lead and it was able to push the heavily outnumbered brigades of Robertson and Benning out of Viniard field. Bradley was wounded during the attack. [ 53 ]   By 6 p.m., darkness was falling, and Braxton Bragg had not abandoned his idea of pushing the Federal army to the south. He ordered Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division (Hill's corps) to join Polk on the army's right flank. This area of the battlefield had been quiet for several hours as the fighting moved progressively southward. George Thomas had been consolidating his lines, withdrawing slightly to the west to what he considered a superior defensive position. Richard Johnson's division and Absalom Baird's brigade were in the rear of Thomas's westward migration, covering the withdrawal. At sunset Cleburne launched an attack with three brigades in linefrom left to right, Brig. Gens. James Deshler, Sterling Wood, and Lucius Polk. The attack degenerated into chaos in the limited visibility of twilight and smoke from burning underbrush. Some of Absalom Baird's men advanced to support Baldwin's Union brigade, but mistakenly fired at them and were subjected to return  friendly fire . Baldwin was shot dead from his horse attempting to lead a counterattack. Deshler's brigade missed their objective entirely and Deshler was shot in the chest while examining ammunition boxes. Brig. Gen. Preston Smith led his brigade forward to support Deshler and mistakenly rode into the lines of Col. Joseph B. Dodge's brigade (Johnson's division), where he was shot down. By 9 p.m Cleburne's men retained possession of the Winfrey field and Johnson and Baird had been driven back inside Thomas's new defensive line. [ 54 ]   Casualties for the first day of battle are difficult to calculate because losses are usually reported for the entire battle. Historian Peter Cozzens wrote that ""an estimate of between 6,000 and 9,000 Confederates and perhaps 7,000 Federals seems reasonable."" [ 55 ]     [ edit ]   Planning for the second day   At Braxton Bragg's headquarters at Thedford Ford, the commanding general was officially pleased with the day's events. He reported that ""Night found us masters of the ground, after a series of very obstinate contests with largely superior numbers."" [ 56 ]  However, his attacks had been launched in a disjointed fashion, failing to achieve a concentration of mass to defeat Rosecrans or cut him off from Chattanooga. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas Connelly criticized Bragg's conduct of the battle on September 19, citing his lack of specific orders to his subordinates, and his series of ""sporadic attacks which only sapped Bragg's strength and enabled Rosecrans to locate the Rebel position."" He wrote that Bragg bypassed two opportunities to win the battle on September 19: [ 57 ]       Bragg's inability to readjust his plans had cost him heavily. He had never admitted that he was wrong about the location of Rosecrans' left wing and that as a result he bypassed two splendid opportunities. During the day Bragg might have sent heavy reinforcements to Walker and attempted to roll up the Union left; or he could have attacked the Union center where he knew troops were passing from to the left. Unable to decide on either, Bragg tried to do both, wasting his men in sporadic assaults. Now his Army was crippled and in no better position than that morning. Walker had, in the day's fighting, lost over 20 per cent of his strength, while Stuart and Cleburne had lost 30 per cent. Gone, too, was any hope for the advantage of a surprise blow against Rosecrans. [ 58 ]       Bragg met individually with his subordinates and informed them that he was reorganizing the Army of Tennessee into two wings. Leonidas Polk, the senior lieutenant general, was given the right wing and command of Hill's Corps, Walker's Corps, and Cheatham's Division. Polk was ordered to initiate the assault on the Federal left at daybreak, beginning with the division of Breckinridge, followed progressively by Cleburne, Stewart, Hood, McLaws, Bushrod Johnson, Hindman, and Preston. Informed that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had finally reached the vicinity after a long train journey from Virginia, Bragg designated him as the left wing commander, commanding Hood's Corps, Buckner's Corps, and Hindman's Division of Polk's Corps. Longstreet did not personally receive these orders until 11 p.m. The third lieutenant general of the army,  D.H. Hill , was not informed directly by Bragg of his effective demotion to be Polk's subordinate, but he learned his status from a staff officer. [ 59 ]   What Hill did not learn was his role in the upcoming battle. The courier sent with written orders was not able to find Hill and returned to his unit without informing anyone. Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge , one of Hill's division commanders, was at Polk's headquarters but was not informed that his division was to initiate the dawn attack. At 5 a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened on the cold and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6 a.m. Hill responded with a number of reasons for delaying the attack, including readjustments of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men. Reluctantly, Bragg agreed. [ 60 ]   On the Union side, Rosecrans held a council of war with most of his corps and division commanders to determine a course of action for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day's battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War  Charles A. Dana  at the meeting made any discussion of retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after  Perryville  and  Stones River  and could conceivably repeat that behavior. [ 61 ]   Rosecrans's defensive line consisted of Thomas in his present position, a salient that encompassed the Kelly Farm east of the LaFayette Road, which Thomas's engineers had fortified overnight with log breastworks. To the right, McCook withdrew his men from the Viniard field and anchored his right near the Widow Glenn's. Crittenden was placed into reserve and Granger, still concentrated at Rossville, was notified to be prepared to support either Thomas or McCook, although practically he could only support Thomas. [ 62 ]   Still before dawn, Baird reported to Thomas that his line stopped short of the intersection of the LaFayette and McFarland's Gap Roads, and that he could not cover it without weakening his line critically. Thomas requested that his division under James Negley be moved from McCook's sector to correct this problem. Rosecrans directed that McCook was to replace Negley in line, but he found soon afterward that Negley had not been relieved. He ordered Negley to send his reserve brigade to Thomas immediately and continued to ride on an inspection of the lines. On a return visit, he founded Negley was still in position and Thomas Wood's division was just arriving to relieve him. Rosecrans ordered Wood to expedite his relief of Negley's remaining brigades. Some staff officers later recalled that Rosecrans had been extremely angry and berated Wood in front of his staff, although Wood denied that this incident occurred. As Negley's remaining brigades move north, the first attack of the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga started. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   September 20          Polk's Right Wing assaults, morning of September 20.       The battle on the second day began at about 9:30 a.m. on the left flank of the Union line, about four hours after Bragg had ordered the attack to start, with coordinated attacks planned by Breckinridge and Cleburne of D.H. Hill's Corps, Polk's Right Wing. Bragg's intention was that this would be the start of successive attacks progressing leftward,  en echelon , along the Confederate line, designed to drive the Union army south, away from its escape routes through the Rossville and McFarland Gaps. The late start was significant. At ""day-dawn"" there were no significant defensive breastworks constructed by Thomas's men yet; these formidable obstacles were built in the few hours after dawn. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, ""our independence might have been won."" [ 64 ]   Breckinridge's brigades under Brig. Gens.  Benjamin Helm ,  Marcellus A. Stovall , and  Daniel W. Adams  moved forward, left to right, in a single line. Helm's  Orphan Brigade  of Kentuckians was the first to make contact with Thomas's breastworks and Helm (the favorite brother-in-law of Abraham Lincoln) was mortally wounded while attempting to motivate his Kentuckians forward to assault the strong position. Breckinridge's other two brigades made better progress against the brigade of Brig. Gen.  John Beatty  (Negley's division), which was attempting to defend a line of a width more suitable for a division. As he found the left flank of the Union line, Breckinridge realigned his two brigades to straddle the LaFayette Road to move south, threatening the rear of Thomas's Kelly field salient. Thomas called up reinforcements from Brannan's reserve division and Col.  Ferdinand Van Derveer 's brigade charged Stovall's men, driving them back. Adams's Brigade was stopped by Col. Timothy Stanley's brigade of Negley's division. Adams was wounded and left behind as his men retreated to their starting position. [ 65 ]       Taken as a whole, the performance of the Confederate right wing this morning had been one of the most appalling exhibitions of command incompetence of the entire Civil War.    Six Armies in Tennessee , Steven E. Woodworth. [ 66 ]       The other part of Hill's attack also foundered. Cleburne's division met heavy resistance at the breastworks defended by the divisions of Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and Reynolds. Confusing lines of battle, including an overlap with Stewart's division on Cleburne's left, diminished the effectiveness of the Confederate attack. Cheatham's division, waiting in reserve, also could not advance because of Left Wing troops to their front. Hill brought up  Gist's  Brigade, commanded by Col. Peyton Colquitt, of Walker's Corps to fill the gap between Breckinridge and Cleburne. Colquitt was killed and his brigade suffered severe casualties in their aborted advance. Walker brought the remainder of his division forward to rescue the survivors of Gist's Brigade. On his right flank, Hill sent Col.  Daniel Govan 's brigade of Liddell's Division to support Breckinridge, but the brigade was forced to retreat along with Stovall's and Adams's men in the face of a Federal counterattack. [ 67 ]   The attack on the Confederate right flank had petered out by noon, but it caused great commotion throughout Rosecrans's army as Thomas sent staff officers to seek aid from fellow generals along the line. West of the Poe field, Brannan's division was manning the line between Reynolds's division on his left and Wood's on his right. His reserve brigade was marching north to aid Thomas, but at about 10 a.m. he received one of Thomas's staff officers asking for additional assistance. He knew that if his entire division were withdrawn from the line, it would expose the flanks of the neighboring divisions, so he sought Reynolds's advice. Reynolds agreed to the proposed movement, but sent word to Rosecrans warning him of the possibly dangerous situation that would result. However, Brannan remained in his position on the line, apparently wishing for Thomas's request to be approved by Rosecrans. The staff officer continued to think that Brannan was already in motion. Receiving the message on the west end of the Dyer field, Rosecrans, who assumed that Brannan had already left the line, desired Wood to fill the hole that would be created. His chief of staff, James A. Garfield, who would have known that Brannan was staying in line, was busy writing orders for parts of Sheridan's and Van Cleve's divisions to support Thomas. Rosecrans's order was instead written by Frank Bond, his senior aide-de-camp, generally competent but inexperienced at order-writing. As Rosecrans dictated, Bond wrote the following order: ""The general commanding directs that you close up on Reynolds as fast as possible, and support him."" This contradictory order was not reviewed by Rosecrans, who by this point was increasingly worn-out, and was sent to Wood directly, bypassing his corps commander Crittenden. [ 68 ]   Wood was perplexed by Rosecrans's order, which he received around 10:50 a.m. Since Brannan was still on his left flank, Wood would not be able to ""close up on"" (a military term that meant to ""move adjacent to"") Reynolds with Brannan's division in the way. Therefore, the only possibility was to withdraw from the line, march around behind Brannan and form up behind Reynolds (the military meaning of the word ""support""). This was obviously a risky move, leaving an opening in the line, but Wood had already been berated earlier that day for not promptly obeying an order, and was not inclined to question this one, even though a ride to Rosecrans's headquarters would have taken less than five minutes. Wood spoke with corps commander McCook, and claimed later that McCook agreed to fill the resulting gap with XX Corps units. McCook maintained that he had not enough units to spare to cover a division-wide hole, although he did send Heg's brigade to partially fill the gap. [ 69 ]   At about this time, Bragg also made a peremptory order based on incomplete information. Impatient that his attack was not progressing to the left, he sent orders for all of his commands to advance at once. Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart  of Longstreet's wing received the command and immediately ordered his division forward without consulting with Longstreet. His brigades under Brig. Gens.  Henry D. Clayton ,  John C. Brown , and  William B. Bate  attacked across the Poe field in the direction of the Union divisions of Brannan and Reynolds. Along with Brig. Gen.  S. A. M. Wood 's brigade of Cleburne's Division, Stewart's men disabled Brannan's right flank and pushed back Van Cleve's division in Brannan's rear, momentarily crossing the LaFayette Road. A Federal counterattack drove Stewart's Division back to its starting point. [ 70 ]          Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20.       Longstreet also received Bragg's order but did not act immediately. Surprised by Stewart's advance, he held up the order for the remainder of his wing. Longstreet had spent the morning attempting to arrange his lines so that his divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia would be in the front line, but these movements had resulted in the battle line confusion that had plagued Cleburne earlier. When Longstreet was finally ready, he had amassed a concentrated striking force, commanded by Maj. Gen.  John Bell Hood , of three divisions, with eight brigades arranged in five lines. In the lead, Brig. Gen.  Bushrod Johnson 's division straddled the Brotherton Road in two echelons. They were followed by Hood's Division, now commanded by Maj. Gen.  Evander M. Law , and two brigades of Maj. Gen.  Lafayette McLaws 's division, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Joseph B. Kershaw . To the left of this column was Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman 's division. Brig. Gen.  William Preston 's division of Buckner's corps was in reserve behind Hindman. [ 71 ]       The scene now presented was unspeakably grand. The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-armsof whistling balls and grape-shot and of bursting shellmade up a battle scene of unsurpassed grandeur.   Confederate Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson [ 72 ]       Longstreet gave the order to move at 11:10 a.m. and Johnson's division proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood's Union division was pulling out of the line. Johnson's brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen.  Evander McNair , encountered opposition from Brannan's division (parts of Col. John M. Connell's brigade), but was also able to push through. The few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught. At the far side of the Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg's brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield's brigade, commanded by Col. William Perry, and the brigade of Brig. Gen.  Jerome B. Robertson , captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge. [ 73 ]   As the Union troops were withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade commanded by Col. Charles G. Harker and sent it back with orders to counterattack the Confederates. They appeared on the scene at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip. [ 74 ]          Defense of Horseshoe Ridge and Union retreat, afternoon and evening of September 20.              Defense of Horseshoe Ridge and Union retreat, brigade details.       Harker conducted a fighting withdrawal under pressure from Kershaw, retreating to Horseshoe Ridge near the tiny house of George Washington Snodgrass. Finding a good defensible position there, Harker's men were able to resist the multiple assaults, beginning at 1 p.m., from the brigades of Kershaw and Brig. Gen.  Benjamin G. Humphreys . These two brigades had no assistance from their nearby fellow brigade commanders. Perry and Robertson were attempting to reorganize their brigades after they were routed into the woods. Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning's brigade turned north after crossing the Lafayette Road in pursuit of two brigades of Brannan's division, then halted for the afternoon near the Poe house. [ 75 ]       My report today is of deplorable importance. Chickamauga is as fatal a name in our history as Bull Run.   Telegram to U.S. War Department, 4 p.m., Charles A. Dana [ 76 ]       Hindman's Division attacked the Union line to the south of Hood's column and encountered considerably more resistance. The brigade on the right, commanded by Brig. Gen. Zachariah Deas, drove back two brigades of Davis's division and defeated Col. Bernard Laiboldt's brigade of Sheridan's division. Sheridan's two remaining brigades, under Brig. Gen.  William H. Lytle  and Col. Nathan Walworth, checked the Confederate advance on a slight ridge west of the Dyer field near the Widow Glenn House. While leading his men in the defense, Lytle was killed and his men, now outflanked and leaderless, fled west. Hindman's brigade on the left, under Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault, crossed the field east of the Widow Glenn's house when Col.  John T. Wilder 's mounted infantry brigade, advancing from its reserve position, launched a strong counterattack with its Spencer repeating rifles, driving the enemy around and through what became known as ""Bloody Pond"". Having nullified Manigault's advance, Wilder decided to attack the flank of Hood's column. However, just then Assistant Secretary of War Dana found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west. [ 77 ]       Whether he did or did not know that Thomas still held the field, it was a catastrophe that Rosecrans did not himself ride to Thomas, and send Garfield to Chattanooga. Had he gone to the front in person and shown himself to his men, as at Stone River, he might by his personal presence have plucked victory from disaster, although it is doubtful whether he could have done more than Thomas did. Rosecrans, however, rode to Chattanooga instead.    The Edge of Glory , Rosecrans biographer William M. Lamers [ 78 ]       All Union resistance at the southern end of the battlefield evaporated. Sheridan and Davis's divisions fled toward Missionary Ridge, taking with them elements of Van Cleve's and Negley's divisions. Rosecrans, Garfield, McCook, and Crittenden, although attempting to rally retreating units, soon joined them in the mad rush to safety. Near McFarland's Gap, Rosecrans and Garfield paused, deciding that Garfield would return to find Thomas while Rosecrans went to Chattanooga to organize his returning men. The provost marshal of the XIV Corps met Crittenden around the gap and offered him the services of 1000 men he had been able to round up during the retreat. Crittenden refused the command and continued his personal flight. [ 79 ]          Snodgrass house.       The entire Army of the Cumberland did not flee, however. Thomas's four divisions still held their lines around Kelly field and a strong defensive position was attracting men to Snodgrass Hill. Brannan and Wood began rallying men there and received a regiment from Negley's division, the 21st Ohio, a unit armed with five-shot Colt revolving rifles, to anchor the right flank of the position. Historian Steven E. Woodworth called the actions of the 21st Ohio ""one of the epic defensive stands of the entire war."" [ 80 ]  The 535 men of the regiment expended 43,550 rounds in the engagement. Stanley's brigade, which had been driven to the area by Govan's attack, took up a position on the portion of the ridge immediately south of the Snodgrass house, where they were joined by Harker's brigade on their left. This group of randomly selected units were the ones who beat back the initial assaults from Kershaw and Humphrey. Soon thereafter, the Confederate division of Bushrod Johnson advanced against the western end of the ridge, seriously threatening the Union flank. But as they reach the top of the ridge, they found that fresh Union reinforcements had arrived. [ 81 ]   Throughout the day, the sounds of battle had reached 3 miles north to McAfee's Church, where the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger  was stationed. Granger eventually lost patience and sent reinforcements south without receiving explicit orders [ 82 ]  to do sothe two brigades of Maj. Gen.  James B. Steedman 's division and the brigade of Col.  Daniel McCook . As the men marched, they were harassed by Forrest's dismounted cavalrymen and artillery, causing them to veer toward the west. McCook's brigade was left behind at the McDonald house to guard the rear and Steedman's two brigades reached the Union lines in the rear of the Horseshoe Ridge position, just as Johnson was starting his attack. Granger sent Steedman's men into Johnson's path on the run. [ 83 ]          Horseshoe Ridge,  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park , 2008.       Several attacks and counterattacks shifted the lines back and forth as Johnson received more and more reinforcementsMcNair's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas's and Manigault's brigades from Hindman's divisionbut many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen.  Patton Anderson 's brigade (Hindman's Division) unsuccessfully attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on the southern end of the battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him ""There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him."" [ 84 ]   Longstreet finally deployed Preston's division, which made several attempts to assault Horseshoe Ridge, starting around 4:30 p.m. Longstreet later wrote that there were 25 assaults in all on Snodgrass Hill, but historian Glenn Tucker has written that it was ""really one of sustained duration."" [ 85 ]  At that same time Thomas received an order from Rosecrans to take command of the army and began a general retreat. Thomas's divisions at Kelly field, starting with Reynolds's division, were the first to withdraw, followed by Palmer's. As the Confederates saw the Union soldiers withdrawing, they renewed their attacks, threatening to surround Johnson's and Baird's divisions. Although Johnson's division managed to escape relatively unscathed, Baird lost a significant number of men as prisoners. Thomas left Horseshoe Ridge, placing Granger in charge, but Granger departed soon thereafter, leaving no one to coordinate the withdrawal. Steedman, Brannan, and Wood managed to stealthily withdraw their divisions to the north. Three regiments that had been attached from other unitsthe 22nd Michigan, the 89th Ohio, and the 21st Ohiowere left behind without sufficient ammunition, ordered to use their bayonets. They held their position until surrounded by Preston's division, when they were forced to surrender. [ 86 ]     [ edit ]   Aftermath       While Rosecrans went to Chattanooga, Thomas and two thirds of the Union army were making a desperate yet magnificent stand that has become a proud part of the military epic of America. Thomas, Rosecrans' firm friend and loyal lieutenant, would thereafter justly be known as the Rock of Chickamauga.    The Edge of Glory , Rosecrans biographer William M. Lamers [ 78 ]       Thomas withdrew the remainder of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw, while his commander and peers fled, earned him the nickname  Rock of Chickamauga , derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, ""Thomas is standing like a rock."" [ 87 ]  Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that ""our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full."" Although he admitted that the troops were tired and hungry and nearly out of ammunition, he added ""I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory."" He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted to prop up the morale of his general, telegraphing ""Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. If I was to suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you."" Privately, Lincoln told  John Hay  that Rosecrans seemed ""confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head."" [ 88 ]   The Army of Tennessee camped for the night, unaware that the Union army had slipped from their grasp. Bragg was not able to mount the kind of pursuit that would have been necessary to cause Rosecrans significant further damage. Many of his troops had arrived hurriedly at Chickamauga by rail, without wagons to transport them and many of the artillery horses had been injured or killed during the battle. Furthermore, the Tennessee River was now an obstacle to the Confederates and Bragg had no pontoon bridges to effect a crossing. Bragg's army paused at Chickamauga to reorganize and gather equipment lost by the Union army. Although Rosecrans had been able to save most of his trains, large quantities of ammunition and arms had been left behind. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas L. Connelly has criticized Bragg's performance, claiming that for over four hours on the afternoon of September 20, he missed several good opportunities to prevent the Federal escape, such as by a pursuit up the Dry Valley Road to McFarland's Gap, or by moving a division, such as Cheatham's, around Polk to the north to seize the Rossville Gap or McFarland's Gap via the Reed's Bridge Road. [ 89 ]   The battle was damaging to both sides in proportions roughly equal to the size of the armies: Union losses were 16,170 (1,657 killed, 9,756 wounded, and 4,757 captured or missing), Confederate 18,454 (2,312 killed, 14,674 wounded, and 1,468 captured or missing). [ 4 ]  These were the highest losses of any battle in the  Western Theater  during the war and, after  Gettysburg , the second highest of the war overall. [ 90 ]  Although the Confederates were technically the victors, driving Rosecrans from the field, Bragg had not achieved his objective of destroying Rosecrans, nor of restoring Confederate control of East Tennessee. [ 91 ]       It seems to me that the  elan  of the Southern soldier was never seen after Chickamauga. ... He fought stoutly to the last, but, after Chickamauga, with the sullenness of despair and without the enthusiasm of hope. That 'barren victory' sealed the fate of the Confederacy.   Confederate Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill [ 92 ]       On September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. Unable to break the siege, Rosecrans was relieved of his command of the Army of the Cumberland on October 19, replaced by Thomas. McCook and Crittenden lost their commands on September 28 as the XX Corps and the XXI Corps were consolidated into a new IV Corps commanded by Granger; neither officer would ever command in the field again. On the Confederate side, Bragg began to wage a battle against the subordinates he resented for failing him in the campaignHindman for his lack of action in McLemore's Cove, and Polk for his late attack on September 20. On September 29, Bragg suspended both officers from their commands. In early October, an attempted mutiny of Bragg's subordinates resulted in D.H. Hill being relieved from his command. Longstreet was dispatched with his corps to the Knoxville Campaign against  Ambrose Burnside , seriously weakening Bragg's army at Chattanooga. [ 93 ]   The Chickamauga Campaign was followed by the  Battles for Chattanooga , sometimes called the Chattanooga Campaign, including the reopening of supply lines and the Battles of Lookout Mountain (November 23) and Missionary Ridge, (November 25). Relief forces commanded by Maj. Gen.  Ulysses S. Grant  broke Bragg's grip on the city, sent the Army of Tennessee into retreat, and opened the gateway to the Deep South for Maj. Gen.  William T. Sherman 's 1864  Atlanta Campaign . [ 94 ]   Much of the central Chickamauga battlefield is preserved by the  National Park Service  as part of the  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park .
