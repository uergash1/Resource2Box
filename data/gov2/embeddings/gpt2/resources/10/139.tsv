GX010-97-14692698	"The Nineteenth Century in Print: Periodicals         About the Text Generated by Optical  Character Recognition without Correction                 The periodicals in this collection were scanned at 600 dots per inch and captured as bitonal (black and white, not greyscale) TIFF images.  The text for the twenty-two periodicals converted by Cornell University Library was generated by a fully automated process of optical character recognition, with no human intervention beyond initial calibration.  The OCR  process was implemented by Cornell University Library staff.  A similar process was used by the University of Michigan Digital Library Production Service to prepare searchable text for  Garden and Forest  for  the Library of Congress.         Why are there strange characters and odd spacing  in the text?    The text was generated automatically by optical character recognition  (OCR).  OCR works best on uniform clear print.  You will notice  problems with small print, special fonts, and decorated text.   Strange  characters,  particularly  ~ , occur in places where the OCR process determined  that a character was present but not what character it was.  Strange  spacing, such as a sequence of blank lines, may occur when pages have  illustrations.   Decorative blocks, such as  the title block   on the front page of each issue of  Garden and Forest , also cause  problems for OCR.    In some cases, the columns on the page were not  recognized as separate sequences of text.        Why was the text not re-keyed?     The advantage of OCR over re-keying is in the cost.  The cost of fully  automated OCR is around 15 cents per page;  the cost of re-keying is determined by the number of characters.  These pages are dense with words and re-keying to the 99.95% accuracy rate required for most Library of Congress projects to date would certainly cost a dollar or two per page.  Human correction of OCR would probably cost at least 4 or 5 times as much as the OCR itself.   The per page difference in cost becomes significant for a collection of around 750,000 pages.        Why not simply use page images?     Most users will want to  view the page images for reading .  The  converted  text is primarily to support searching .  Search the full text of a  periodical for a place, say  Chesapeake Bay . [Choose ""match  this exact phrase"" as an option, and ""match words exactly,"" rather than  ""include word variants.""] Imagine using microfilm or even browsing the original paper issues.   Would you find these items? When  you search the full text, links from result lists will take you to the  uncorrected text.   Often, there will be a  Best Match  button at  the top (beside the American Memory logo).  This will take you to the  section of the retrieved text with the best or most matches to the words you  entered.  View page  links will take you to the image of the selected page. You will be able to browse backwards and forwards  through the volume.              Return to  The Nineteenth Century in Print:  Periodicals"
