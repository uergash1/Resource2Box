The Sonoma County District Attorney's office said search                      warrants were served in Marin, Sonoma and Napa counties. Two                      were served in San Rafael, one in Sebastopol and one in unincorporated                      Napa County.                      The targets of the probe are ""women's gifting clubs,''                      which operate under many names including ""Women Empowering                      Women,'' ""Female Philanthropy Circle,'' ""Prosper                      Forever,'' and variations of ""dinner'' and ""garden''                      clubs or circles.                     Offenders face charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, theft                      and tax evasion, according to the California Department of                      Corporations which said the scheme has surfaced in Sacramento,                      San Diego and other parts of the state recently.                     ""It's the same old beast dressed up in different ways,''                      a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations said.                     Sonoma County authorities said the scams they are investigating                      are variations of one known in Sacramento as ""Women Helping                      Women.'' Eight women were arrested there last month. There                      were no arrests today in the North Bay, said Sonoma County                      Deputy District Attorney Dani Jo Handell.                     The scams depend on a tight regime of secrecy, phone conferences                      and e-mail and Internet involvement, Sonoma County authorities                      said.                     Women victims are lured into the scheme by promises of reaping                      $40,000 by bringing eight other women into the club or circle,                      each of whom contributes $5,000 then recruits eight more women.                     At the center of the circle is the ""bouquet'' who stands                      to make $40,000 through the recruitment of ""buds'' ""blooms''                      and ""blossoms'' as the circle divides. The Sebastopol                      ""garden circle'' employed this method, Handell said.                     Only a few players at the top of the pyramid, or center of                      the circle, receive a $40,000 payout before the scheme collapses,                      authorities said.                     Handell said the current variation of the age-old scheme                      is ""alarming'' because it is very regimented and holds                      training seminars on recruitment methods and uses the Internet                      to maintain its structure. Hundreds of women in the North                      Bay are involved, Handell said.                     Women who recognized the scheme for what it was when they                      were approached about it tipped off authorities, Handell said.                     The investigation in the North Bay has been going on for                      months, Handell said.                     ""This gets more sophisticated as time goes by,'' she                      said.                                                                                                                                                    • Securities   • Franchises  •  Off-Exchange Commodities  • Investment and Financial Services •  • Independent Escrows  • Consumer and Commercial Finance Lending  • Residential Mortgage Lending •         Back to Top of Page                © 2003 State of California.

This page last updated:    June 13, 2002                                         OCS  Study MMS 98-0048           Petroleum Extraction in Santa Barbara County, California:           An Industrial History           BACKGROUND: MMS requested researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara         to conduct an historic analysis of the petroleum extraction industry in San Luis Obispo,         Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties from 1950 to 2015. The researchers developed separate,         stand-alone reports on each of the three counties include an analysis of the oil         industry’s evolution and projected future, its relationships with the surrounding         communities, and its role in a complex economy. They also investigated the regulatory         context in which oil does business, and to the kinds of innovations developed to operate         in the Santa Barbara Channel’s natural and social environment. In addition to these         reports, they produced an inventory of all firms operating in the tri-counties during         these years, and which oil fields they operated (OCS Study MMS 98-0061).            This summary was developed by the researchers.           OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to provide an historical analysis of the evolution of the         petroleum extraction industry in Santa Barbara County, including its changing business         structure, economic impacts, technological advances, local social contexts, and         governmental effects. We attempt to depict a comprehensive view of what an industry means         as it operates in a given locale, documenting a wide variety of both direct and indirect         consequences and relationships.           DESCRIPTION: Our methods are diverse, tailored to the specific research issue and         available data. We interviewed or consulted approximately 100 persons with relevant views         or information, drawn from a wide variety of business, government, and civic groups. We         scrutinized government statistics from state, federal, and local agencies. We used         multivariate regression analysis to determine economic effects; we examined tax documents         to specify industry dollars contributed to the county tax base. Through interviews, phone         inquiries, and document searches, we derived estimates of the industry’s local         philanthropic contributions. We reconstruct, using state of California archives, a record         of company activities in terms of which firms operated in which fields at which time         points. We also provide information regarding oil firm adaptation and the special role of         environmental consulting companies as part of the industry.           We provide information regarding local support and opposition to the industry and how         political campaigns affecting the industry were conducted and funded. We indicate the         nature of the industry’s labor supply, including the wage levels of personnel. We         analyze the kind of regulations and local oversight faced by the industry and the way         controversies, regulations, and permitting activities impacted local government         operations. We also discuss technological advances stimulated by local drilling and         production. Finally, we offer scenarios of potential future local operations.           SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum industry’s long presence in Santa Barbara         County has had important impacts both on the industry and the region, but not always of         the expected kind. In economic terms, the effects have primarily been significant in terms         of contributions to the county tax base (especially in certain earlier periods), as         opposed to significantly stimulating growth in the private economy. In terms of business         structure, the Santa Barbara County oil industry has consistently allowed room for small         operators and independent producers, despite dominance by major companies. In terms of         social context, the industry has been highly controversial, reflected in an on-going split         between north and south county communities on the benefits and liabilities of the         industry.           In part due to the county’s internal controversies over the industry, it has been         highly regulated compared to its operations elsewhere, having consequences both for the         industry’s ability to time its projects and the county’s administrative         capacities. Among the innovations have been changes in regulatory rules as well as         technological advances (stimulated as well by specific geologic conditions). Given current         local and national attitudes toward the industry and offshore drilling in particular, any         new initiatives will be carefully scrutinized by local government units.           STUDY RESULTS: The decline in volume of oil produced in Santa Barbara County onshore         was compensated by offshore development, at least through the early 1980s. Based on our         econometric analysis, it appears that although oil activity has been a steady part of the         local economies over the period of our study, the region would have been equally as well         off economically had there been no such activity. We could not find, using our regression         analyses, any statistical pattern of positive impacts of the industry’s presence on         the overall scale of economic activity. In terms of property tax payments, the industry         generated $12.6 million in county revenues at its 1985 high point, a level it has recently         approached again in 1996 after a decade of declining tax payments (falling as much as 33         percent in 1991).           The industry structure was remarkable in the degree that opportunities for new entrants         continued over time, rather than the tendency toward monopolization often characteristic         of industrial maturation. While major oil companies predominated until very recently,         large independents and smaller operators have constantly been a significant part of the         industry, keeping over 100 different producers in the fields of Santa Barbara County         across the years. Turnover among producers (except, until recently, the major companies)         has been a regular feature of the county’s industry, with successive waves of         operators finding opportunity in the declining fields that no longer seemed as promising         to previous producers. That is true of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activity, where a         significant shift continues of major operators leaving the area, turning their investments         over to smaller independents. Some oil-related firms diversified beyond petroleum         operations, including a significant sector of environmental consulting which is         particularly strong in the Santa Barbara South Coast region.           Santa Barbara County’s relatively stringent regulatory regime on all development         issues has affected oil with particular force. Costly political campaigns have been waged,         including elections at the local supervisorial level and county-wide initiatives affecting         the industry. The North County region tends to support the industry’s expansion, both         through the kinds of candidates it elects to office and voters’ positions on         oil-related initiatives. Past pollution events, especially the 1969 oil spill and—to         a lesser degree—the long-term and high-volume diluent spill at the county’s         northern border, are significant to local discourse. In terms of innovations over the         years, the most important local technological advances have come in the form of enhanced         capacity to drill at great water depths. Regulatory innovations have also been strong,         such as the SEMP program through which the industry pays offsets as its impacts are         detected and measured rather than through fees set in advance of development.            Current proposals for additional oil activities (and likely scenarios for the         near-term) involve one or two slant-drilling initiatives. Given the modest impacts of the         industry’s current production regime, it is doubtful that such operations will have         important aggregates impacts on the county’s economy, social make-up, or governmental         structure (although site-specific impacts are potential).

Ellen Tauscher (D-Contra Costa & Alameda Counties) and George Miller (D-Martinez) announced that the $1 million they requested for the County Connection bus service crossed a key legislative hurdle today. The provision is part of the annual transportation funding bill that was approved today by the House Appropriations Committee. The $1 million will help the County Connection buy new buses to help increase service in Pleasanton and Martinez.   ""The $1 million that George and I are securing for County Connection will help commuters by increasing the number of bus trips to the ACE trains in Pleasanton as well as the BART train in Martinez,"" said Tauscher. ""We need to make a greater investment in County Connection to help it keep pace with the increasing demands of commuters in Contra Costa County. Right now, the County Connection is short 18 full-size buses to meet expected service demands over the next four years. As our region becomes more crowded, the only way to deal with the influx of cars on our roads is to make mass transit a relevant and efficient option for East Bay commuters.""   ""County Connection provides a tremendous service to commuters eager to use public transportation instead of overcrowded freeways,"" said Miller. ""This $1 million will help County Connection meet its goals to better serve our residents.""   The total cost of adding 18 full-size buses is expected to be $6,281,000. State and local funding is expected to make up the difference. When fully operational, the buses will support an increase in shuttle service in downtown Martinez, provide express service from the North Concord BART station to downtown Martinez, and provide expanded service to Bishop Ranch and to the ACE train in Pleasanton.   The $15.8 billion national transportation spending bill that includes this provision is expected to be taken up by the full House of Representatives next week. The Senate must also consider the bill. Last year, Tauscher and Miller secured $500,000 to help expand County Connection service.     ###"

Operation    Arizona Man Shipped Products to Make Fake Driver's Licenses to 41 States          August 12, 2003    03-096  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  (916) 324-5500     (SACRAMENTO)  – Attorney General Bill Lockyer today announced his office and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have broken a huge counterfeit driver's license operation believed responsible for producing fake I.D.'s that were distributed in California, 40 others states and the District of Columbia.  The investigation is believed to be among the largest involving driver's license fraud in DMV's history.   ""These fake I.D.s predominantly were used by underaged college students who wanted to get into bars and buy alcohol,"" Lockyer said.  ""This sophisticated operation, which provided the tools to manufacture fake driver's licenses throughout the county, not only contributed to the widespread problem of underage drinking.  During these times of increased concern about financial privacy, I.D. theft and terrorism, this ring  greatly enhanced the opportunity for criminals to establish fake identifications to commit fraud and acts of terrorism.""   In his criminal  complaint , the Attorney General charged Jason Andrew Miller, 21, of Tempe, Arizona, with producing hundreds of counterfeited driver's license laminates bearing the California DMV and California State seals and, in some cases, the magnetic strips.  Miller also is accused of selling those laminates to individuals who used them to manufacture fake driver's licenses.  Miller is alleged to have charged $5.25 per laminate, 75 cents to generically encode each magnetic strip, and $2 for specific encoding of the magnetic strip.   The investigation conducted by the Attorney General and the DMV showed that Menux Inc., a company owed and operated by Miller, also manufactured counterfeited laminates consistent with the state of Texas, and offered for sale on his website laminates consistent with the states of Arizona, Oregon, Michigan and New Jersey.  The company operated over the Internet and shipped products using United Parcel Service to addresses in 41 states and the District of Columbia.   Miller will surrender himself on Wednesday, August 13, 2003, at 10:30 in Department 8 of the Sacramento County Superior Court.  Judge Gary E. Ransom has set his bail at $250,000.   The Sacramento Valley High Technology Crimes Task Force, composed of members of the Attorney General's Office and the Sacramento Sheriff's Office, assisted in serving search warrants in Sacramento and Davis.  Other high tech task forces throughout the state passed on information to local law enforcement agencies for possible actions regarding individuals identified in the investigation throughout the state.   The investigation already has led to other arrests.  Three University of California, Davis, students were arrested on April 1, 2003: Daniel Paul Aleksander, Joseph Aaronelijah Stewart and Nicholas William Blasgen.  The cases, which will be prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office, accuse the defendants of receiving the laminates from Menux and using them to manufacture counterfeit California driver's licenses.   The investigation has already resulted in the arrest and convictions of Jason Richardson, 20, of Elk Grove.  Richardson pled guilty to one count of forgery related to the production and sale of counterfeited driver's license laminates bearing the California DMV and California State seals.  He was sentenced on April 1 to 150 days in county jail and five years of formal probation.   Rouben Kirakossian, 32, pled guilty to possession of Menux material while committing the crime of identify theft.  He was sentenced on July 18, 2003, in Placer County, to 150 days in county jail and three years of formal probation.   Shipping records obtained during the investigation show that Miller, doing business as Menux, sent 857 packages to various addresses throughout the United States, including 261 in California.  In California, the packages were sent to residences in Albany, Aliso Viejo, Aptos, Atascadero, Bakersfield, Bay Point, Beverly Hills, Buena Park, Burbank, Carlsbad, Carson, Chico, Chula Vista, Concord, Coto de Caza, Danville, Davis, Del Mar, Dove Canyon, El Cajon, El Sobrante, Elk Grove and Encinitas.   Packages also were sent to residences in Foster City, Goleta, Granada Hills, Hayward, Irvine, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Los Gatos, Malibu, Manhattan Beach, Menifee, Mission Viejo, Modesto, Montclair, Mountain View, North Hollywood, Oakland, Oxnard, Pacific Palisades, Panorama City, Pasadena, Pittsburgh, Pleasant Hill, Pleasanton, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rancho Santa Fe, Redlands, Rodeo, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Leandro, San Mateo, San Pedro, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Simi Valley, South Lake Tahoe, Stockton, Sunnyvale, Tustin, Vallejo, Walnut Creek, Westlake Village and Willits.   The investigation continues and more arrests are expected.        # # # #   BACK                                                                                          OFFICE OF THE AG  |  PROGRAMS & SERVICES  |  NEWS & ALERTS  |  PUBLICATIONS  |  CONTACT US  |  SEARCH REGISTERING WITH US  |  CAREER OPPORTUNITIES  |  LINKS TO STATE SITES Privacy Policy  |  Terms & Conditions  |  © 2001 DOJ"

             August              30, 2000  -               Former Assembly Republican Leader Scott Baugh requests Governor Davis              to call a Special Session that would be dedicated to focusing on the              looming state-wide energy crisis, which has already struck San Diego              residents.                                                               September              6, 2000 -               Davis signs two bills stemming from the power crisis in San Diego.              One would spread energy price increases for San Diego customers over              several years, the other speeds up the approval process for new power              plants.             September              7, 2000 -              The state Public Utilities Commission approves the rate-averag ing              plan for San Diego customers, which caps their rates for three years.              Fitch Investors warn that even higher energy rates and mounting debts              for utilities are coming.             September              8, 2000 -   Wholesale energy prices on the California Power Exchange              continued to soar in August, pushing the state's three utilities more              than $3 billion into a financial hole and creating calls for dismantling              the state's deregulated power.             September              12, 2000 -                 The Governor renews his request for immediate action by the FERC to              restore wholesale prices to fair levels.             September              14, 2001 -               PG&E credit rating changes from ""stable"" to ""negative.""             September              21, 2000 -              The CPUC unanimously grants to SDG&E the ability to purchase 1,900              MW (half of its peak load) under contracts covering periods as long              as 5 years.

PG&E writes Loretta Lynch that after 9 weeks, the CPUC staff has              not produced guidelines for long-term contracts and still has not              done so today. SCE later concurred that they were hitting roadblocks              with the CPUC staff while trying to get approval of long-term contracts.              Edison asks a total of seven times in 20 months for broader authority              to make the kind of electricity buys the governor now says will deliver              us from the crisis. Each time, the CPUC either denies Edison's request              or approves it only after applying significant restrictions that ultimately              make it impractical for the utility.                                 November        1, 2000 -        PG&E, SCE and SDG&E report they are now more than $6 billion in        the red due to their inability to pass along their wholesale costs to their        customers. The FERC recommends California utilities enter into long-term        contracts and denies Davis' request for $100 mWh wholesale electricity rate        caps saying that amount won't even cover the generators' costs.                                       December 1, 2000              -               The Governor issues his 8-point plan to help solve the energy              crisis. The CEC provides status report on all pending power plant              applications.             December 6, 2000              -              A request is made by the ISO and later repeated by the Governor that              all California residents turn OFF their outdoor Christmas lights until              after 7 p.m. each evening.             December 7, 2000              -              The ISO declares the first Stage Three emergency when power reserves              fall below 1.5 percent. Officials say conservation efforts averted              rolling blackouts throughout the state.             December 8, 2000              -              The FERC lifts wholesale electricity price cap $250 mWh at the request              of the ISO. Utilities intensify catastrophic predictions.             December 13, 2000              -              Davis and legislative leaders meet in D.C. with Energy Secretary Bill              Richardson who orders 12 generators to continue selling power to PG&E              and SCE. A federal order is issued by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.              The order from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) instructs approximately              75 entities, some within the state of California and others within              the western region, to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange              and transmit the electric energy requested by the California ISO.              Loretta Lynch announces the CPUC will consider raising retail electricity              rates.             December 15, 2000              -              The FERC issues its plans for generation in California, including              a soft cap of $150 per megawatt.             December 16, 2000              -              Davis concedes that a Special Session will have to be convened, and              reserves $1 billion in his budget to address the crisis.             December 20, 2000              -              The CPUC meets to consider rate increases to prevent bankruptcies              of So Cal Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric; sets and conducts              hearings on December 27, 28, 29 and January 2 for public input on              effect of rate increases.             December 26, 2000              -              Southern California Edison sues the FERC, alleging the Commission              failed to ensure that wholesale electricity is sold at ``just and              reasonable'' rates.                                                                  January              2, 2001 -              The ISO announces there were 55 Stage One Alerts, 36 Stage Two Alerts              and one Stage Three Alert in the year 2000. There were no rolling              blackouts initiated in 2000. The three investor-owned utilities estimate              they now have spent more than $9 billion for power which they must              collect from rate-frozen ratepayers. The Governor announces that he              will file a ""friend of the court"" brief in support of the              lawsuit filed last week by Southern California Edison against the              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that charges the federal              agency with failing to protect ratepayers from record prices charged              by power generators.                            January 3, 2001 -                Governor Davis convenes a Special Session to address the California                Energy Emergency, 132 days after the Republicans asked for one.                         January              3-4, 2001 -              The CPUC announces it will grant a rate increase for PG&E and              Edison of 9% for residential customers, 7% for small business customers,              12% for medium commercial customers, and 15% for large commercial              and industrial customers. The increase will be for 90 days only. The              AB 1890 rate freeze is continued.             January              5, 2001 -              A federal court in Washington rejects Edison's bid to force federal              regulators to cap prices on wholesale electricity. Edison announces              it will cut 1,850 jobs over the next several months.             January              8, 2001 -              Davis, in his State of the State speech, proposes a public agency              to build power plants, and threatens to seize the plants of wholesalers              who gouge consumers and utilities and pledges at least $1 billion              in state funds to resolve the crisis.             January              9, 2001 -              State and federal officials meet for seven hours in Washington but              find no solutions.             January              11, 2001 -              The ISO declares a Stage Three power alert, but stops short of ordering              scattered blackouts. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson extends              an emergency order keeping power flowing to the state after Davis              submits a conservation plan. An Assembly committee approves bills              to shake up two power boards and require utilities to get state permission              to sell power plants. PG&E lays off 325 employees and says it              will let another 675 go if its finances do not improve.             January              12, 2001 -              Davis meets with the governors of Oregon and Washington. Other Western              governors say California needs to build more power plants. The FERC              approves PG&E's request for permission to restructure to insulate              assets in the event of bankruptcy.             January              13, 2001 -              State and federal officials resume talks with representatives of power              companies. Under the proposal that emerges, the Legislature would              let the state buy electricity from wholesalers and sell it to utilities              at a reduced rate under long-term contracts.             January              15, 2001 -              Power supplier Dynegy Inc. threatens to take SoCal Edison and PG&E              to bankruptcy court if they fail to make payments due this week.             January              16, 2001 -              The ISO declares a Stage Three alert as several plants report a shortage              of natural gas. Edison tells federal regulators it doesn't have the              money to pay $596 million it owes this week, including $215 million              to the California Power Exchange for wholesale-power purchases. The              exchange considers whether to make the utility buy its power elsewhere.              Standard & Poor's downgrades the credit ratings of SoCal Edison              and PG&E to junk-bond status.             January              16 & 17, 2001 -              Rolling Blackouts are implemented as the ISO is unable to procure              enough electricity to keep supply and demand balanced on the statewide              grid. Silicon Valley reports losses in excess of $500 million. Governor              Davis declares a State of Emergency and asks the Legislature for help.             January              17, 2001 -              AB 1X passes out of the Assembly. The Governor signs AB 5X and 6X.              AB 5X shrinks the ISO board from 25 members to 5 members, who are              all appointed by the Governor, and the appointments are not subject              to Senate approval.             January              18, 2001 -              The Assembly concurs with SB 7x that authorizes the Department of              Water Resources to spend $400 million to buy and sell electricity.              This bill is based on a plan to have the state buy electricity from              wholesalers and sell it to utilities at a reduced rate. The Governor              signs AB 5X (Keeley) and AB 6X (Dutra and Pescetti).             January              19, 2001  -              Governor Davis signs SB 7X (Burton) giving the DWR $400 million to              buy power for California until February 1, 2001. Davis appoints another              person to the CPUC, creating a Davis-controlled majority.             January              22, 2001 -              Governor Davis announces auction for long-term energy contracts, officially              putting the state into the energy business.             January              24, 2001 -              Davis hosts an internet auction for power bids. Thirty-nine suppliers              offer deals. Davis' office reports that he is considering using his              emergency powers to take over Edison's contracts.             January              26, 2001 -              Davis announces that rate hikes are now a possibility.             January              26-28, 2001 -              The LA Times reports that Alan Greenspan said the crisis will threaten              the nation's economic growth. The CPUC halts the voluntary conservation              program, which shuts off about 1400 industrial users doing power shortages.              Davis names Freeman to head energy negotiations. Mexico agrees to              sell California power.             January              29, 2001 -              Assembly Republican Leader Bill Campbell criticizes Governor Davis'              lack of leadership on the energy crisis, and his lack of direction              regarding what he would support in legislation. An executive summary              of the audits conducted on PG&E and Edison shows that the utilities              are entitled to 20% rate hikes. The utilities file lawsuits to recover              these lost funds.             January              30, 2001 -              President Bush appoints Vice President Cheney to head a cabinet-level              task force to tackle California's crisis and its potential effects              on the national economy.             January              31, 2001 -              Assembly Republican Leader Bill Campbell issues a press release calling              on Davis to demonstrate leadership on the energy crisis. A few hours              later, Governor Davis sends letters to the Senate and Assembly, urging              the passage of AB 1X. Assemblywoman Carol Migden attacks Republican              Legislators for not offering up any solutions to the energy crisis,              when, in actuality, Republicans have offered up 12 bills, and one              has been signed by the Governor. The Joint Republican Caucus releases              a 15-point plan on resolving the energy crisis. Senator Perata begins              circulating a manifesto that calls on Davis to act quickly to establish              a public power authority.                                                                  February 1, 2001 -              Democrat Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews is the only Democrat not to              vote for AB 1X. She later changes her vote. Governor Davis signs AB              1X, putting the state into the power buying business. The state joins              the major utilities in purchasing power in the spot market, which              the utilities find troubling - as they believe they should have been              out of the spot market when the state got into it. Davis announces              his publicity campaign for energy conservation.             February 2, 2001 -              Governor Davis directs the state energy negotiators to sign some deals              by February 5, 2001 - the day before the federal order to continue              selling energy to California expires. The DWR says it will buy a maximum              of 5% of the state energy load in the spot market.             February 5, 2001 -              Governor Davis seizes $160 million in PG&E contracts, right before              they would have been seized by one of the utility's creditors.             February 7, 2001 -              Assemblyman La Suer introduces AB 34X, which expedites the environmental              review, permitting and completion of ""repowering"" projects.             February 8, 2001 -              Davis announces a plan to streamline the siting and permitting process.              U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell orders four companies to continue              selling power to the ISO - the order lasts until February 16, 2001.             February 15, 2001              -              Davis announces his support to purchase 32,000 miles of power lines.              Assembly Democrat approval ratings fall to 25%, and Davis is at 45%..             February 16, 2001              -              Energy Costs and Availability Committee Chairman Rod Wright says that              there will most likely be a rate increase.                            February 20, 2001 -                 It becomes clear to Republican                members of the Legislature that Governor Davis is keeping them out                of the loop, as Democrats are made privy to the cost of Davis' plan                for bailout ($7 billion) and Republicans are not.                         February 21, 2001              -              The first day that California has not been in a Stage Three energy              alert in more than 30 days. The California Energy Commission pinpoints              32 spots in the state for construction of peaker plants. Chief State              Budget Analyst Elizabeth Hill announces that the state budget is taking              major hits, and that the state economy has already lost $1 billion              due to the energy crisis.             February 22, 2001              -              Duke Energy says that it will not sign any long-term contracts with              California unless the Governor promises to pay for all emergency power              that was purchased by Edison and PG&E. The State has now spent              $1.7 billion on energy, and announces that it expects to spend $2.3              billion by March. SMUD announces the necessity of a rate hike.             February 25, 2001              -              Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones attacks Governor Davis for              his counter-productive leadership activities during the energy emergency.             February 26, 2001              -              The DWR wants to amend 4-month old contracts for peaker plants; the              DWR's actions dramatically slow the construction plans for the plants              that will provide auxiliary energy during peak consumption. Governor              Davis meets with Federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. Governor              Davis announces ""an agreement in principle"" with Edison.              Mirant Corporation agrees to sell California 750 megawatts in March.                           February 27, 2001              -               Davis said the state is two weeks to a month away from completing              all the ""legislative fixes"" to the electricity crisis, and              that with ""a little luck and a lot of conservation"" he hopes              to avoid power blackouts this summer when demand is at its peak. Orange              County business leaders announce that companies might have to shut              down or leave California if rolling blackouts aren't averted and the              state doesn't fix its ""interruptible"" conservation program.             February 28, 2001              -              California power regulators declare a Stage Two power alert as electricity              reserves threaten to drop below 5 percent. The declaration marks the              end of a brief respite from power alerts.                                                                 March 1, 2001 -              Calpine Corp. said it signed two more long-term contracts with the              state Department of Water Resources valued at $8.3 billion. Southern              California Gas Co. agreed to provide as much as 30 million cubic feet              of gas per day to PG&E in the next month. The DWR announces that              it will not buy power above what it deems a reasonable rate. This              leaves the ISO to bill the utilities for the power it buys to cover              the state's real-time needs, and power suppliers are concerned they              will not be paid. The San Jose Mercury News announces that power generators              allegedly overcharged wholesale customers for electricity by as much              as $550 million. Now, the agency is asking federal regulators to refund              the high costs, said the draft press release obtained by the Mercury              News. Edison agrees to support AB 24X authored by Republican Assemblywoman              Lynn Daucher. Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland files a request              for disclosure of the power contracts under the Public Records Act.             March 4, 2001 -              Assemblyman Strickland sends a Public Records Act request to the Department              of Finance asking for the spot market power purchases to date and              the long-term contracts for energy.             March 5, 2001 -              The Assembly Republican Caucus asks Governor Davis to call a special              legislative session to solve the state's pending natural gas crisis.              The San Jose Mercury News reports that Pacific Gas and Electric has              agreed to sell its transmission lines to the state as part of a larger              deal to rescue the company from financial collapse.             March 6, 2001 -              Governor Davis announces that he has 40 contracts for long- term power.              (In actuality, less than 25 of these contracts are finalized at the              time of the announcement). These contracts are valued at about $40              billion, and supposedly include enough power to light 9 million homes              over the next decade. The average purchase price of each deal is $69              per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators              before California's energy market went awry.             March 8, 2001 -              The Senate and Assembly weekly histories are published. Between the              two houses of the Legislature, a total of 186 bills have been introduced              in the special session; 4 have been signed.             March 9, 2001 -              Governor Davis' office begins to make public some details of the 40              contracts that he has signed for long-term power. Governor Davis says              he needs $500 million more from the state's general fund so that the              state can continue purchasing power until the $10 billion in revenue              bonds are issued to finance long-term supply contracts. Assembly Speaker              Robert Hertzberg has appointed a subcommittee of the Energy Costs              and Availability to focus on natural gas supplies and prices.                            March 12, 2001 -                 Assemblyman Strickland forwards                Public Records Act requests to the Department of Water Resources                (DWR), Controller Kathleen Connell, and the Department of General                Services. Governor Davis announces that his first two proposals                for peaker plants have been received by the California Energy Commission.                Congresswoman Anna Eshoo asks U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft                to investigate whether electricity wholesalers engaged in unlawful                trade practices to manipulate energy prices in order to reap higher                profits.                          March 13, 2001 -              Assemblyman Runner, Budget Committee Vice Chair, published a report              on the budget proceedings that states that the budget is going to              take major hits due to the energy crisis. Governor Davis announces              his plan to spend nearly $90 million additional taxpayer dollars in              order to provide rebates to energy consumers who conserve. The state              Senate forms a committee to investigate whether power generators illegally              manipulated California's electricity market to drive up prices over              the past year. Five energy producers announce that they are planning              to default on $11.1 million in property taxes they owe in 9 California              counties. Edison owes them hundreds of millions of dollars for power              it never paid for. Secretary of State Bill Jones speaks out against              the Governor's energy spending.             March 14, 2001 -              The FERC announces that it has serious concerns about two power generators              in California engaging in price gouging as a way of profiting at the              expense of Californians, who experienced rolling blackouts when an              adequate supply of energy was unavailable.             March 15, 2001 -              A Stage Two power alert is declared. Three bills were passed out of              the Assembly: AB 8x by Assemblywoman Migden (57-5), AB 24x by Assemblywoman              Daucher (67-0), AB 31x by Assemblyman Wright (67-0). Federal Energy              Secretary Spencer Abraham warned that electricity blackouts in California              ""appear inevitable"" this summer, and voiced strong opposition              to implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices. The FERC declared              that they have `serious questions' about the unavailability of two              generating units last spring that resulted in nearly $11 million in              profits for the owners of the companies. The Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission announced several regulatory actions designed to mitigate              the energy shortage, including actions to expedite the approval for              natural gas pipelines into the western region of the United States.              The Legislative Analyst's Office concludes that there may be enough              power to avoid outages this summer. Three qualified facilities sign              a petition for bankruptcy against Edison. The Public Utilities Commission              votes to prohibit PG&E and SoCal Edison from cutting 3,000 workers.             March 16, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle publishes an article which says that Governor              Davis' administration has been spending on average $6 million more              a day ($51 million total) on power than previously stated ($45 million).              The Senate Budget committee tentatively slices $1.9 billion from Davis'              proposed spending plan. Casualties include $40 million for park land              along the Los Angeles River, $100 million to protect beaches from              polluted runoff and $50 million in grants to people who buy or lease              electric vehicles. U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham sends Governor              Davis a letter saying the Bush administration does not oppose the              state's proposal to buy the power grid, but is recommending that the              required FERC approval be contingent upon the grid being available              to other power generators.             March 19, 2001 -              The ISO declared a stage two power alert today, as energy reserves              grew scarce. Rolling blackouts followed in the Sacramento area, as              the utilities were forced to shed 500 megawatts. The Department of              Water Resources announced that there be may serious problems with              getting precious water to the Central Valley due to the significant              expenditures that the DWR has made purchasing energy for the state.              The Dow Jones Newswire is reporting that the Senate Budget Committee              will deny further requests for state funds to buy electricity unless              state regulators immediately carve out a revenue stream to allow the              Department of Water Resources to recover the money. The federal government              is going to be providing $50 million to 3,100 public housing authorities              throughout the nation in order to help pay for high utility bills.              The Federal Energy Department announces that they have concerns over              gas prices this summer, since gas stock is low and crude oil prices              are high.              March 20, 2001 -              Rolling blackouts are ordered across California again as demand for              electricity exceeds supply. The ISO warns that blackouts could happen              between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. The blackouts are the result of a patchwork              of circumstances: increased demand, more power plant outages, less              output from the state's financially struggling alternative energy              producers, lower electricity imports from neighboring states, and              sharply reduced voluntary power cuts by big businesses. PUC Administrative              Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa says that he will issue a draft decision              on how the state will be paid for power purchases ""as soon as              practical"" but must first take comments on a letter sent by the              state on March 14. The Assembly Republican Caucus delivers a letter              to the Governor, demanding the resignation of Loretta Lynch, due to              her utter job failure during the energy crisis. Republican members              of Congress from California meet with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham              to discuss the ongoing situation in the wake of blackouts that began              Monday of this week.             March 21, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Pacific Gas and Electric              and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher rates              a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell              the state their transmission systems and some land. California State              Controller Kathleen Connell says the state's general fund surplus              has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because              of electricity purchases made by the state's Department of Water Resources.              U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr issues a preliminary injunction              Wednesday ordering Reliant Energy Services to continue selling energy              to California despite its fear that it will not be paid. State Controller              Kathleen Connell complains that the energy crunch is imperiling California's              financial health. Connell orders an audit of the state's power buying,              saying Davis is withholding key financial information from her office              and the Legislature. She also refuses a request by Davis and the Legislature              to transfer $5.6 billion into a 'rainy day fund' she said was set              up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion              in revenue bonds to cover its power buying. Transferring the money              would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt.                           March 22, 2001 -              An Imperial County judge rules that geothermal energy supplier CalEnergy              Operating Co. can suspend delivery to Edison and begin selling power              on the open market. An economist working for the ISO concludes that              electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than $5 billion              by manipulating the energy market. The ISO files the findings with              federal regulators yesterday, and asks for a refund. The judge said              Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling              power to the ISO, which buys at the last minute on behalf of utilities              to bolster supplies and try to fend off blackouts. David Boies, the              attorney who led the Department of Justice's antitrust case against              Microsoft Corp., is retained as counsel to two small California power              producers in their bid to get Edison to repay more than $100 million              in past due payments. AB 8X fails passage out of the Assembly, after              being approved by the Senate.             March 23, 2001 -              The Assembly reconvenes to try and pass AB 8X, but the bill is not              taken up after a day of caucusing. Assembly Speaker Hertzberg cancels              the trip to Washington, D.C. in light of the growing crisis and lack              of solutions.             March 25, 2001 -              CPUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynch announces that the commission plans              on increasing rates anywhere from 20 to 50%.             March 26, 2001 -              Edison announces that it will begin paying the QF's on a forward-going              basis, starting with energy supplies for April. The New York Times              runs a story which suggests that El Paso Merchant Energy Company took              steps to manipulate the natural gas market in order to control both              retail prices and supply.             March 27, 2001 -              The PUC unanimously approves a 46% increase in retail electricity              rates, the largest in the state's history. In light of the rate hikes,              the utilities' stocks are again on the rise.             March 28, 2001 -              The FERC orders further inquiry into allegations by California officials              that El Paso Natural Gas Co. manipulated the natural gas market by              keeping supply artificially low, thus contributing greatly to the              skyrocketing price of electricity in the state. Governor Davis meets              with legislative Democrats to brief them on the status of talks between              the state and the utilities regarding the purchase of the power grid.             March 29, 2001 -               Strickland files a Public Records Act lawsuit in San Diego Superior              Court. Defendants are Governor Gray Davis, Controller Kathleen Connell,              DWR Director Thomas Hannigan and DWR. He joined in his suit by Strickland              is joined in the lawsuit by Assembly members Roy Ashburn, Bill Campbell,              John Campbell, Dave Cogdill, Dave Cox, Dennis Hollingsworth, Jay LaSuer,              Bill Leonard, Dennis Mountjoy, Keith Richman and Phil Wyman. A Stage              Two power alert is declared as power reserves dip. It is called off              later when power supplies exceeded 7% (a warning was still in effect).              PG&E announces that almost 70 percent of its 4.6 million customers              can expect an increase in their bills as a result of the $4.8 billion              rate increase adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission.              The Office of the Ratepayer Advocate, a division of the CPUC accuses              San Diego Gas and Electric of padding electricity bills in a scheme              that has cost area ratepayers at least $170 million in recent months.                                                                               April 2, 2001 -              A Stage Two Power Alert is called. An Imperial County judge delays              action on power wholesaler CalEnergy's case against Southern California              Edison over $140 million in bills the utility has failed to pay. Judge              Donal Donnelly plans a hearing April 16. The Foundation for Taxpayer              and Consumer Rights releases a countdown to ``Judgment Day,'' saying              there are 582 days until its anti-rate hike initiative goes to voters              on Election Day in November 2002.             April 3, 2001 -              Power grid managers declare another Stage Two alert as power reserves              approach 5 percent. Downed transmission lines complicate the flow              of electricity up the state and about 13,000 megawatts of electricity              remained offline for repairs or maintenance. Gov. Gray Davis appears              before the Senate Democrats' caucus to brief the lawmakers on energy              issues.             April 4, 2001 -              Energy Commission lawyers decide that California cannot require builders              of new power plants to sell electricity to California, even in exchange              for a rushed environmental review of their projects. The Assembly              approves legislation extending a rate cap for San Diego Gas &              Electric's residential and small-business customers to medium and              large businesses. The measure now goes to the Senate. The Senate Appropriations              Committee sends the Senate a $408 million energy conservation measure              that would provide grants and loans to improve energy efficiency at              homes, businesses and government agencies. Congressional Democrats              including Reps. Mike Honda and Anna Eshoo of California announce legislation              that would impose power rates based on the cost of service and let              western states recover overcharges by power suppliers.             April 5, 2001 -              Legislature passes legislation for conservation efforts. Davis addresses              state on TV in order to discuss his support for conservation and rate              increases. He also outlines his alternative to the PUC's rate hike.             April 6, 2001 -              PG&E files for bankruptcy.             April 9, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces a deal for the state to buy transmission              lines from Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion. A federal              bankruptcy judge rules PG&E can continue using its assets to back              its purchases of natural gas, assuring suppliers will continue being              paid despite the company's filing for Chapter 11 protection. The state              Attorney General's office and state Department of Finance conclude              the state is not a PG&E creditor and will continue to be paid              for the electricity it is buying on PG&E's behalf, despite the              utility's bankruptcy.             April 10, 2001 -              FERC holds a conference in Boise, Idaho, on Western energy issues.              The first of three House Government Reform Committee hearings begin              in Sacramento.             April 11, 2001 -              A second member of the FERC begins supporting price caps. A confidential              document emerges from the LA Times demonstrating that public power              agencies have engaged in price gouging - the LADWP is named. Federal              court orders Enron to continue selling energy to universities. Davis              signs $850 million in conservation bills.             April 12, 2001 -              Roseville PUC says it will have to raise rates. Supplier Reliant announces              it filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, asking that              California's Attorney General keep private records it plans to supply              to the state as part of an investigation into price manipulation.              Reliant says it wants assurances that the subpoenaed documents won't              get leaked to its competitors.              April 16, 2001 -              PG&E and Edison are scheduled to pay back debts starting this              week. The California Energy Commission says business and residents              cut their electricity use by 9.2 percent in March compared to a year              ago. Power use fell 8 percent in February and 6.2 percent in January              over a similar period last year. Davis taps David Freeman, general              manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to be his              permanent chief energy adviser and to help launch the energy conservation              programs signed into law last week. The Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission orders energy wholesalers to justify $587,000 in possibly              excessive charges for electricity sold to California's utilities in              March. The order is the third time the FERC has ordered power wholesalers              to justify more than $124 million in charges for January and February.                                         April 17, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis lobbies Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats              on his plan to buy the transmission lines owned by Southern California              Edison. Edison is scheduled to release its earnings report. The state              remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. A Los              Angeles County Superior Court judge has scheduled a hearing on a lawsuit              filed against Davis by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group.              The group wants Davis to announce the details of power purchases made              by the state. Edison International declares a huge write-off of electricity              and other costs. Edison posts a fourth-quarter operating loss of $3.8              billion, versus operating income of $326.9 million in 1999. Operating              loss for 2000 was $1.73 billion, compared with operating income of              $1.75 billion in 1999.

Legislative Democrats adjourn first extraordinary                session in order to make bonds available in 90 days. Governor calls                for second extraordinary session, which is convened. Assemblymembers                Dutra and Nation offer an alternative to Davis' proposal to purchase                Southern California Edison's transmission lines for $2.76 billion                to help the company pay its massive debt. They propose that Edison                give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmissionlines                for $1.2 billion. The Assembly Energy Oversight Subcommittee releases                a report criticizing FERC for approving contracts it says led to                exorbitant natural gas prices. FERC holds a Washington, D.C., hearing                on the natural gas market. A lawsuit by Democratic legislative leaders                asking a federal judge to order FERC to trim energy prices has been                delayed until next week. Edison International reports a $617 million                first-quarter loss. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali hears arguments                from lawyers for both Pacific Gas and Electric and the state Public                Utilities Commission, but has yet to rule whether the PUC was within                its rights to force PG&E to make an accounting change that prevents                the utility from recouping its $13 billion debt from its customers.

May 22, 2001 -              A new peaker plant has been licensed, and should be up and running              by September. Legislative Democrats sue FERC for not setting reasonable              rates, citing that the state's elderly and hospitalized populations              are being put at tremendous risk. Under a stipulation filed in San              Francisco Superior Court, Reliant Energy, Mirant Corporation and Dynegy              will provide documents demanded by the state justice department's              investigation of possibly unlawful or anti-competitive behavior that              may have triggered soaring electricity prices in California. Gov.              Gray Davis signs Assembly Bill 3X. It requires the state Public Utilities              Commission and the utilities to sign up more low-income customers              for discounted electricity rates. Davis signs Senate Bill 28X, giving              local governments more than $3 million in grants to speed reviews              of power plant proposals; shortens approval times for remodeling existing              plants from 12 months to six months and extends the four-month siting              process for peaker plants.

State Controller              Connell says contracts the administration negotiated with electricity              generators give them first priority. Davis' advisors say she's wrong              and the general fund will be repaid the money the state is spending              to buy power on behalf of three cash-strapped utilities.             May 24, 2001 -              The PUC votes on whether to provide 30 minute warnings before blackouts.              Reliant Energy sharply lowers its power prices in anticipation that              Southern California air quality monitors will let three plants release              more pollution this summer. Davis says he is considering paying businesses              to run dirty diesel generators to boost the state's power supply and              help avert rolling blackouts. The state Department of Water Resources              signs a 19-month agreement with Mirant for 500 megawatts of power              beginning in June. The state Public Utilities Commission approves              a new round of programs that offer big customers cheaper electricity              in exchange for less power use. The PUC decides to begin re-examining              the calculation that determines which residential customers of the              state's two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent              record rate increase.

The California Energy Commission              licenses a 530-megawatt addition to the existing Contra Costa Power              Project a mile northeast of Antioch. Construction on the $250-300              million project should begin in early summer 2001, with the plant              on line by early 2003.             May 31, 2001 -              A Stage Two energy alert is declared, as reserves fall below 7%.

State energy regulators say they are close to              proving how power wholesalers manipulated the energy market and participated              in price gouging. Twelve Long Beach residents file a lawsuit against              their city, saying officials violated the law by charging much more              than neighboring Southern California Gas Co. The lawsuit, which seeks              class-action status, claims $38 million in damages.                                                                 June 1, 2001 -              Judge Linda B. Quinn, San Diego Superior Court, Department 74, sets              oral arguments for June 13, 1:30 pm. California grid managers respond              to a federal order that offered some price controls on wholesale electricity              but only if the state gives up some control of its power grid. In              April, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered California              to file a proposal to join or create a regional transmission organization,              or RTO, or forego the limited price caps that took effect Tuesday.              Officials with the California Independent System Operator, keeper              of the state's power grid, say FERC's order is illegal, since it links              price caps to the state's joining an RTO.             June 4, 2001 -              56% of respondents to a Washington Post support wholesale electricity              price caps. PG&E's creditors agree to allow the top executives              to receive $17.5 million in bonuses, as long as the management submits              a financial reorganization plan by January 2002. Chevron Corp. will              reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless              they are exempted from rolling blackouts. The Senate Rules Committee              agrees to issue subpoenas to eight out-of-state power generating companies              demanding documents on pricing, bidding and other aspects of electricity              sales in the state.             June 5, 2001 -              Two major power suppliers, AES and Williams Energy, say they are the              subject of a Justice Department investigation. The civil probe is              focused on whether an agreement between AES and Williams Energy limited              the expansion of power plants that AES owns in Southern California""             June 6, 2001 -              Pacific Gas & Electric Co. asks U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali              to stop the manager of the state's power grid from buying electricity              for utility or charging it for any electricity bought after the utility              filed for bankruptcy on April 6. Separately, the utility's creditors              support its request to the bankruptcy court to pay out $17.5 million              in bonuses to the management team that guided the utility into bankruptcy.              California Department of Water Resources reveals it is negotiating              with municipal utilities to buy their surplus power. Department spokesman              Oscar Hidalgo says talks began last week but no agreements are imminent.              Pacific Gas and Electric announces a decrease in natural gas prices,              down 38 percent from May's rates and 66 percent lower than January's              rates. The LA Times publishes reporting that wholesale prices of electricity              and natural gas in California have fallen sharply in recent weeks,              and experts say that the relief could be the harbinger of an energy              turnaround. At night, when demand slackens, power sometimes sells              for less than $20 per megawatt-hour. That is reminiscent of the days              before prices went haywire last summer. It is a drastically different              scenario than the $500 to $800 the state paid during a spate of hot              weather last month. Meanwhile, wholesale natural gas prices at a bellwether              pipeline junction on the Southern California-Arizona border dipped              last week to their lowest levels since November, according to a publication              that tracks the industry. Separately, Southern California Gas Co.              and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. reported June rate cuts for their              residential gas customers of 16% and 38%, respectively. Experts credited              a combination of conservation, mild weather, a burst of increased              hydroelectric generation and lower natural gas prices for the drop              in electricity costs.""                           June 7, 2001 -              House Republicans announce that they are abandoning efforts to push              for a short-term energy bill to help California this summer after              failing to come to an agreement with Democrats over capping Western              electricity prices. State power regulators increase the electric bill              discount for low-income customers from 15 percent to 20 percent. Gov.              Gray Davis announces a plan to install more than 3,400 real-time electricity              meters in businesses in the Los Angeles area.             June 11, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis signs an executive order letting natural gas-fired              power plants operate in excess of usual air emission limitations.              Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefs Davis on his criminal investigation              of power generators. The state Assembly, by a 50-17 vote, asks Congress              to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds              of excessive energy charges and set wholesale electricity price caps.              Department of Water Resources Deputy Director Ray Hart sends a letter              to the generators that the state has signed long-term contracts with.              He advises them that the state is prepared to release ""redacted,""              or edited contracts to the judge at the June 13th hearing and ask              her to release the state from the secrecy clauses contained in the              contracts.                            June 12, 2001 -              Southern California Edison reaches an agreement to stabilize prices              and pay part of its debts to alternative power producers. The deal              calls for an end to litigation by those small companies that produce              power from alternative sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, bio-mass              and at gas-fired co-generation facilities. The Environmental Protection              Agency denies California's request for an exemption from using ethanol              in gasoline - a move that is sure to hike up California gas prices.              The FERC is expected to consider expanding wholesale electricity price              caps when the have a committee hearing next week. Attorney General              Bill Lockyer announces that he will convene a criminal grand jury              to investigate possible illegal market manipulation practices. Vice              President Dick Cheney tells Californians in Congress Tuesday not to              expect energy price controls from the Bush administration. Senator              Burton says he'll introduce three energy-related measures in the Legislature              including one that would repeal a 10 percent rate hike scheduled to              take effect next year.             June 13, 2001 -              A San Diego County Superior Court judge orders the state to release              details of 38 long-term power contracts. Judge Linda B. Quinn gives              the governor's office until noon on Friday to make the contracts,              worth $42 billion, available to the public. The state Public Utilities              Commission unanimously passes an agreement between Southern California              Edison and small power generators that could help the utility avoid              bankruptcy and keep the lights on this summer.             June 14, 2001 -              The state pays $29 million for power, the first time the cost has              dropped that low since the state began buying electricity on behalf              of three cash-strapped utilities Jan. 17. Air quality management officials              tell a Senate committee that third-party transactions and sales to              brokers are driving up the price of air emission credits.              June 15, 2001 -              Gov. Davis releases nearly $43 billion worth of state long-term energy              contacts with 18 electricity providers, for the public to review.                           June 18, 2001 -              A heat wave marks the return of rolling blackouts to California, with              the ISO forecasting the possibility of Stage 3 alerts for Monday and              Tuesday. Federal energy regulators order price restraints on              electricity sales throughout 10 Western states and California. Governor              Davis announces a deal with Sempra (SDG&E), which relieves ratepayers              from having to pay the debt of the utility. PG&E executives will              get their $17.5 million in bonuses as a way to retain them in their              current employment.             June 19, 2001 -              Edison International chief John E. Bryson says a federal ruling this              week limiting wholesale energy prices in 10 Western states isn't enough              to pull its utility, Southern California Edison, any further from              the brink of bankruptcy. More than two months after Davis signed a              memorandum of understanding to assist financially strapped Southern              California Edison, a Senate committee begins hearings on the proposal.              The Senate Energy Committee will hold at least three days of hearings              before the Judiciary and Natural Resources committees begin their              own hearings before the Aug. 15 deadline for legislative action. The              governments of California, New York and Connecticut, along with several              environmental and consumer groups, file suit to stop the Bush administration's              decision to weaken efficiency standards for central air conditioners.             June 21, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis testifies before the U.S. Senate Government Affairs              Committee, telling senators that the state should get a $9 billion              refund from power wholesalers that overcharged the state in the past              year. Davis says the price controls approved by federal regulators              will help the state, but they don't address the overcharges.             June 25, 2001 -              The FERC and various other parties to the dispute on generator over-charges              begin meetings to determine if and how much refunds will be. Governor              Davis announces that three new power plants will be brought on-line              in the next three weeks. Three more ""whistleblowers"" come              forth to accuse Duke Energy of intentionally taking power off line              during an energy crisis. FERC commissioners Pat Wood and Nora Brownell              meet with Davis and attend California Energy Commission meeting. The              Senate, by a 34-0 vote, gives final approval to a resolution asking              Congress to allow states to extend daylight-saving time to the full              year to save energy. Assemblyman Mike Brigg's bill to give customers              a one-month schedule of when they might be vulnerable to rolling blackouts              is rejected by the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee.             June 26, 2001 -              State treasurer Phil Angelides announces the state has received a              $4.3 billion loan that will go to buy energy in the months to come.              The Coyote Valley power plant, to be built by Calpine, is approved              by the San Jose City Council. Assemblyman Strickland is triumphant              against Davis, as the San Diego judge ruling on his case, Strickland              V. Davis, forces to Davis to disclose the financial details of the              contracts the Governor signed with wholesale power generators.             June 27, 2001 -              State regulators postpone a scheduled vote barring consumers from              shopping around for electricity until next Tuesday at the request              of state lawmakers seeking a compromise to keep the ""direct access''              option alive. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali orders that Pacific              Gas & Electric Co. is free to ignore hundreds of millions of dollars              worth of electricity bills from the ISO, and for the ISO to stop purchasing              power on behalf of the cash-starved utility.                                                                 July 2, 2001 -              The state discloses that Californians cut their energy consumption              by 12.3% percent in June, down from May 2001. The ISO announces that              they were responsible for telling Duke Energy to cut their production,              to keep an even amount of energy on the grid, which makes Governor              Davis, Lt. Governor Bustamante, and the supposed ""whistleblowers""              all look like fools. State Controller Kathleen Connell releases the              unedited contracts that Governor Davis has signed with energy producers.              A Stage Two energy alert is declared. Electricity supplier Duke Energy              unveiled operations logs Monday to fight accusations that it manipulated              turbine output to boost prices in California during January. State              grid operators already have acknowledged that they, not the company,              were the ones in charge during the three days in question. The Sutter              Power Plant comes on line, adding 540 megawatts to the grid.             July 3, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asks a bankruptcy judge to give the company              until Dec. 6 to submit its plan of reorganization. Under the current              timeline, the utility has until Aug. 6 to file that plan. State power              regulators cancel a vote on whether to continue allowing Californians              to shop for their electricity as they do for long distance phone service.              State grid managers declare a Stage 2 power alert as electricity reserves              drop below 5 percent.             July 9, 2001 -              Energy talks wind down in Washington DC, with little hope of resolution.              Presiding Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner said that the state              is owed no more that $1billion. The state is demanded over $8 billion,              and the energy companies have offered only $740 million in settlements              and refunds.             July 10, 2001 -              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis says a committee of Pacific Gas and Electric              Co. ratepayers has no legal standing in bankruptcy court. Calpine              Corporation says it is near agreement with California officials over              money the state says the company overcharged for electricity. That              would make it the first company to settle a portion of the $8.9 billion              dollars the state is seeking in proceedings before the Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission. Enron Corp. is suing state officials to stop              a Senate subpoena of its financial records in a dispute over alleged              overcharges for its electricity sales to California.             July 12, 2001 -              Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., releases his recommendation, which says              that while there are ""vast sums"" due for overcharges, California              utilities, grid managers and the state agency purchasing power owe              generators even more. Wagner says the state's estimate that it's owed              $8.9 billion ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Several              members of California's congressional delegation will submit a letter              to federal energy regulators, supporting Gov. Gray Davis' position              in the settlement talks over refunds for alleged electricity overcharges.              The Senate approves a resolution supporting the governor's use of              his emergency powers that let him commandeer power plants or contracts              to stabilize wholesale electricity prices. The Public Utilities Commission              approves a program that lets large industrial companies bid for how              much they get paid when they cut electricity use as blackouts loom.              An energy company scraps plans to build a new power plant in Chula              Vista, blaming state officials for failing to guarantee that the facility              would turn a profit. Officials from Ramco Inc., announce that they              couldn't reach an agreement with the state Department of Water Resources              on the amount of energy to be generated at the proposed plant. The              natural gas-fired generator would have produced up to 62 megawatts              during peak usage and was scheduled to be operational by Sept. 30.             July 16, 2001 -              US Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali rules that is acceptable              for PG&E to pay top level executives their bonuses, as a means              to retain them as employees, and steer the utility out of its current              financial crisis. The State Assembly passes the budget act.              July 17, 2001 -              A new, bi-partisan bill to bail out Edison emerges, co-athored by              Assemblymen Rod Wright (D) and Keith Richman (R). PG&E sues the              state seeking reimbursement for millions of dollars in energy contracts              Davis legally seized Jan. 31. Duke Energy reports a 27 percent jump              in its second-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street's expectations.             July 18, 2001 -              A CBS News poll finds that 40 percent of California residents blame              government for the energy woes, more than the 33 percent who blame              energy companies. California officials acknowledge the state has begun              selling power for a fraction of its purchase price as cool weather              creates an abundance of electricity. The state Public Utilities Commission              issues a proposed agreement, which explains how it will work with              the state Department of Water Resources to ensure the state is repaid              for the billions it has spent buying electricity for the customers              of three              financially ailing utilities: A RATE INCREASE. Both the Senate and              the Assembly try to pass their versions of the governor's Memorandum              of Understanding with cash-strapped Southern California Edison. The              Davis administration on tells consultants buying energy for the state              to sell their stock holdings in energy companies immediately or quit              their jobs.                           July 19, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. decides to extend contracts to buy electricity              from 131 small power plants for the next five years. Assemblyman John              Campbell sends a letter to the director of the Department of Water              Resources, demanding to know how much surplus power the state is selling              and at what price. Californians now say that although the state needs              power, nuclear energy is not a safe enough source. The poll, released              Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California, showed that              55 percent of residents believe nuclear power is too dangerous, even              if building more nuclear power plants would help alleviate the country's              energy problems. In a Field Institute poll of 1,015 adults released              in May, 59 percent of Californians favored nuclear power and 36 percent              were opposed. Edison International Inc., the parent of troubled utility              Southern California Edison, reports a loss of $102 million in the              second quarter, primarily due to unrecovered costs of buying power.             July 22, 2001 -              The DWR announces that rate hikes will most likely not be necessary.             July 23, 2001 -              U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveils a plan Monday to help              alleviate a transmission bottleneck that has kept power from flowing              freely throughout the state during times of peak usage. The plan calls              for expanding the state's power grid along so-called Path 15 by attracting              private investment for the $300 million project. The San Francisco              Chronicle publishes a story that Morgan Stanley, a multibillion dollar              financial firm and adviser to several power generators, destroyed              documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California              consumers. Secretary of State Bill Jones asks the state Assembly to              allot $250,000 for a legislative review into whether Gov. Gray Davis'              advisers complied with conflicts of interest laws. A Senate committee              investigating possible price manipulation has given the full Senate              a report asking for Houston-based Enron Corp. to be cited for contempt.              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali gives Pacific Gas and Electric              Co. four additional months to produce a reorganization plan in its              Chapter 11 filing. Reliant Energy Inc. sues California for failure              to pay for long-term power contracts Gov. Gray Davis seized in February              from the state's now defunct Power Exchange.              July 24, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle publishes a story which shows the state's              financial losses in selling energy back to the grid at a loss. Pacific              Gas and Electric Co. officials ask the state to hold a public hearing              on its revised revenue requirements from customer rates. State Controller              Kathleen Connell refuses to pay claims totaling $3,661 for meals for              DWR employees. She says they improperly used a state credit card to              pay for meals, including $910 for sushi and $439 for Italian takeout.              Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. called for a trial-like hearing within              60 days to resolve the dispute. California claims generators overcharged              by $8.9 billion; wholesalers offered to refund slightly more than              $700 million.              July 25, 2001 -              Federal energy regulators agree with California that it was charged              too much for electricity in the past year, but put off until the fall              a decision on the amount. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              orders an evidentiary hearing, to be completed within 60 days, to              determine the size of the refund from providers of wholesale power.              Secretary of State Bill Jones calls for the federal Securities and              Exchange Commission to investigate Davis administration energy advisers,              particularly consultant Vikram Budhraja, for ""possible insider              stock trading.'' Attorney General Bill Lockyer has ordered State Contoller              Kathleen Connell to pay a contract with Davis' energy advisers. Connell              had refused to make the payments, saying the advisers had a conflict              of interest. The AG's office says there are no grounds to withhold              payment to Saber Partners, LLC or Blackstone Group, LP, for work they've              done for the state on energy issues. If the controller doesn't pay              by Wednesday, the attorney general's office says it will sue her to              force the payment.              July 27, 2001 -              Governor Davis fires five energy consultants amid accusations and              a Securities and Exchange Commission Insider Trading investigation              regarding the consultants' energy stock purchases.             July 29, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              decision, state officials say. Refunds could help prevent the state              from raising electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which              are now beyond $8 billion.              July 30, 2001 -              After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated electricity              market is set to begin Tuesday. Under a pilot program, officials of              the state's electrical grid will begin switching some customers to              new power providers at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The state has been joined              by natural gas industry players in accusing Houston-based El Paso              Corp.of restricting the flow of natural gas into California to drive              up its price and ultimately the cost to ratepayers. The gas shippers              that lease the pipeline space now also say El Paso is to blame for              soaring California energy prices.                                                                 August 2, 2001 -              Steve Maviglio, spokesperson for Governor Davis, sells his Calpine              stock, amid accusations of insider trading.             August 3, 2001 -              Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, criticized Gov. Gray Davis and his chosen              directors of the state's electricity grid Thursday for costing California              potentially billions of dollars in electricity refunds from power              wholesalers. Ose, chairman of a House investigative subcommittee,              said the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's              electricity grid, lacks independence from Davis, a Democrat.              August 6, 2001 -              Curtis Hebert, a target of congressional Democrats and California's              governor over his handling of the Western power crisis, announces              that he is resigning at the end of the month as chairman of the Federal              Energy Regulatory Commission.             August 8, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. tells state power regulators the amount              of electricity each household can buy at the cheapest rate should              be adjusted upward. Gov. Gray Davis ceremonially flips the switch              on a peaker power plant in the Palm Springs-area. Public Utilities              Commission President Loretta Lynch and Consumers Union say the future              resignation of the nation's top energy regulator is good news for              California. Patrick Wood III, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission and former PUC chairman in Texas, is FERC Chairman Curtis              Hebert's likely replacement. California consumer's electric rates              won't climb any higher, according to officials from the agency that              has spent more than $9 billion buying power on behalf of millions              of utility customers. The state Department of Water Resources, however,              did raise by roughly $5 million its estimate of how much money it              would need to keep buying electricity and recoup its debts, said department              spokesman Don Strickland.              August 9, 2001 -              State Controller Kathleen Connell says the state plans to issue $6              billion in short-term bonds to cover California's electricity costs              until it irons out complications with issuing an expected $12.5 billion              in municipal bonds. Connell says the state's general fund is running              low after recent power purchases and the bonds could be issued as              early as September. California power managers say 65 million customers              in 14 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico were at risk of              blackouts last week when several power suppliers failed to deliver              electricity to the region as promised. Gregg Fishman, a spokesman              for the California Independent System Operator, said during last Thursday's              incident, the balance was so close that the unexpected loss of a single              power plant could have triggered the region's worst outage in five              years.              August 15, 2001 -              Energy companies say they're owed $1.25 billion for power sold through              the state grid in April and May. Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director              of the Independent Energy Producers, says payment for April sales              is more than a month late. Republican Assemblyman John Campbell is              urging the Legislature to hold oversight hearings on Gov. Gray Davis'              energy actions. Campbell says the governor has committed more than              $50 billion in ratepayer's funds without enough oversight. Assembly              Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, would have to set a hearing              on the issue. The unexpected resignation of Enron Corp. president              and chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling sends the Houston-based energy              giant's stock tumbling to a 52-week low.              August 18, 2001 -              The state announces that it paid less in July for power purchases              than each of the two preceding months. Officials say the state paid              $909 million to purchase electricity in July, nearly $100 million              less than in June and more than $1 billion less than in May.              August 20, 2001 -              Lawmakers return to Sacramento on Monday to the unfinished business              of how to prevent Southern California Edison from following the state's              largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., into bankruptcy.             August 21, 2001 -              The Public Utilities Commission announces a preliminary list of businesses              and institutions that could receive exemptions from rolling blackouts.              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asks a Sacramento Superior Court judge              to order the Department of Water Resources to hold a public hearing              on the department's revenue requirements. Gov. Gray Davis swears in              four members of the state's new power authority. S. David Freeman              will be the chairman of the new board and Sunne McPeak, John Stevens              and Donald Vial will serve on the board. Freeman receives a salary              of $220,008 for the position. Davis says he has agreed with Assembly              Democratic leaders on a version of his deal to rescue Edison from              bankruptcy. The new plan calls for the state to allow Edison to issue              $2.9 billion in revenue bonds, which would be repaid by Edison's commercial              and industrial customers. The utility would still have $1 billion              in debts to energy companies. August 23, 2001 Republican lawmakers              again call for legislative oversight hearings to examine energy purchases              and possible conflicts of interest by state power traders and members              of Gov. Gray Davis' staff.              August 23, 2001 -              Southern California Edison officials tell state lawmakers Thursday              that a plan moving through the Assembly is close to what would allow              the utility to regain its financial health, even though it leaves              the utility with $1 billion in debt. The Assembly, by a 43-23 vote,              approves a bill that creates a new board within the Public Utilities              Commission to find ways to encourage more low-income families to sign              up for current energy-bill assistance programs. It moves to the Senate.              A state commission will attempt to determine whether a top energy              adviser to Gov. Gray Davis had a conflict of interest in negotiating              a contract with an out-of-state power company he had worked for months              earlier. Vikram Budhraja had worked for the Williams Cos. months before              he participated in contract negotiations between the state and the              Tulsa, Okla.-based energy company. The state Fair Political Practices              Commission will examine whether there was a conflict of interest.                           August 24, 2001 -              Members of the new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing              Authority opens its inaugural meeting to a packed crowd, vowing to              support energy consumers. At the top of the new authority's inaugural              agenda: how to avoid the conflicts of interest allegations that have              plagued the state's other power-related agencies, the Department of              Water Resources and the California Energy Commission. S. David Freeman,              chairman of the power authority, vowed to screen all prospective employees'              statements of economic interest before hiring for the new agency.                           August 27, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces a new $1 million program for California              K-12 teachers to receive grants of up to $3,000 for energy conservation              education.              August 28, 2001 -              The Public Utilities Commission delayed release of the draft rate              agreement that gives the state Department of Water Resources the authority              to raise utility customers' rates without PUC review. The PUC plans              to vote on the draft agreement, and several other key energy measures,              on Sept. 6.             August 29, 2001 -              The Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee passed the Edison              MOU on an 11-7 vote - largely along party lines. An energy glut and              advances in water purification are sparking fresh interest in desalination              plants that could boost water supplies in Southern California. The              Metropolitan Water District, which supplies 300 cities between Ventura              County and the Mexican border, said Thursday it will begin soliciting              bids this fall from potential builders for plants capable of supplying              water for up to 250,000 people.              August 30, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sends letters to Northern and Central              California lawmakers, urging them to oppose a proposal from state              power regulators to shift $500 million in power costs from Southern              California customers to PG&E customers. Consumer advocates protest              a $2.9 billion revenue bond deal to prevent Southern California Edison              from slipping into bankruptcy, after the Assembly energy committee              voted to strip out a requirement that Edison transfer 21,000 acres              of sensitive Sierra watershed lands to a trust created by the state.              The Association of California Water Agencies joins other business              groups around the state protesting the looming suspension of direct              access, or the right for Californians to shop around for the best              deal on electricity.                                                                 September 4, 2001              -              The Public Utilities Commission issues its latest revision of how              much ratepayer money three ailing California utilities must provide              the state's electricity-buying agency. The latest numbers show Pacific              Gas and Electric Co. was ordered to hand over about $6.5 billion,              Southern California Edison $4 billion and San Diego Gas and Electric              $1.5 billion. The Assembly Appropriations Committee approves a bill              to rescue near-bankrupt Southern California Edison, sending the measure              to the full Assembly for approval as early as Wednesday. The committee              reinstated 20,000 acres of development rights on timberland surrounding              Edison's hydroelectric facilities. However, consumer advocates warned              the bill does not sufficiently safeguard ratepayers from having to              pay off Edison's $3.9 billion debt. The Assembly Energy Costs and              Availability Committee approves a bill that would require the Department              of Water Resources to hold public hearings on their power purchases.              The bill, by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, also sets aside a              portion of customer rates to repay $12.5 billion in revenue bonds.              It also limits how that money can be spent by DWR to power purchases              and legislatively approved administrative costs. The bill moves to              the Assembly Appropriations Committee.              September 8, 2001              -              The State Assembly passes the Edison MOU on a vote of 41-32. State              treasurer Phil Angelides says the state will have to re-time its expected              sale of $12.5 billion in bonds because of the PUC's delay on suspending              direct access and a host of other issues key to shaping California's              response to its energy debacle. Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive              financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible              price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge rules.             September 10, 2001              -              California businesses are now threatening to sue following recent              increases of up to 49 percent. This week, regulators are expected              to raise rates 19 percent for large businesses in San Diego County              while limiting increases for residents to an average 12 percent. The              Los Angeles Times breaks a story that the LA DWP made far more money              on the state's energy crisis than even previously thought - sometimes              as much as 53% over cost. Records show that during the worst 13 months              of the crisis ending in May, the DWP profited $200 million on sales              of $680 million, the Times said. The agency says it is still owed              $180 million.              September 13, 2001              -              The Senate Energy Committee considers yet another version of Gov.              Gray Davis' plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy.              The latest plan would let the utility issue $2.5 billion in bonds,              leaving the company with $1.4 billion in debts. The state Senate approves              a bill that requires Senate confirmation of the governor's appointees              to the Independent System Operator board of governors. The bill, by              Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, also increases the terms from              one to three years. It was sent to the governor's desk on a 33-4 vote.              The Enron Corp. and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price              Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market agree to get Enron documents              to committee investigators.              September 17, 2001              -              Governor Davis and Senator Burton engage in verbal sniping over the              possibility of a third extraordinary session - Burton says he will              immediately adjourn any special session. Security is stepped up at              power plants throughout California.             September 18, 2001              -              Edison creditors begin mulling over the idea of forcing Edison into              bankruptcy, in light of diminishing hopes of a bailout (see September              17, 2001).             September 20, 2001              -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will split its corporation into four              entities, company officials said Thursday, as part of its bankruptcy              reorganization plan. The plan, filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court              in San Francisco, will allow the utility to pay about $13.2 billion              in creditor claims without asking the court to raise customer rates.              PUC announces it expects to decide whether to suspend the option of              California consumers to switch from their electric utility to a competitor              for lower prices or electricity generated from renewable resources.              The commission also is expected at its Thursday meeting to raise electric              rates for San Diego utility customers and allow the state's power-buying              agency to pass along its power costs to consumers without scrutiny              to ensure they spent taxpayer money reasonably. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein,              D-Calif., asks Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood              to review the commission's ethics regulations and record-keeping procedures.              Feinstein says a recent General Accounting Office report found that              former Chairman Curt Hebert, Jr., had discussed support for his continued              appointment as chairman with Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay. The              GAO says those calls didn't violate any law or ethics standards, but              Feinstein says FERC should review its policies on communications between              commissioners and the regulated community. Gov. Gray Davis announces              that total costs in August reached $815 million down nearly $100 million              from July spending. Power prices have dropped over the summer, in              part due to cooler-than-expected temperatures and boosted energy conservation,              which lowered demand.              September 25, 2001              -              Newspapers report that Davis will call for the Third Extraordinary              Session to begin next Tuesday. The state files its first claim against              PG&E. A report says California is relying too heavily on natural              gas to fuel its power plants. The California Public Interest Research              Group says the state should diversify its mix of power and include              more renewable resources, such as wind and solar, to prevent another              energy crisis. State Controller Kathleen Connell announces that the              Franchise Tax Board has filed a $22 million claim in federal bankruptcy              court seeking payments from Pacific Gas and Electric Co.             September 26, 2001              -              Gov. Gray Davis calls a third special legislative session, to begin              Oct. 9. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announces October natural gas              bills for its customers should be at least 50 percent lower than last              year. State Treasurer Phil Angelides says delays by the California              Public Utilities Commission mean the state won't issue $12.5 billion              in energy bonds to repay the state general fund until next year, and              any more delays could cause a $9.3 billion deficit in the next fiscal              year. The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets sends a letter to Gov.              Gray Davis and the leaders of the House and Senate, asking lawmakers              to allow businesses and California residents to switch from their              utility to a competing electricity provider to take advantage of lower              energy costs.              September 27, 2001              -              State Controller Kathleen Connell announces that the Franchise Tax              Board has filed a $22 million claim in federal bankruptcy court seeking              payments from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Energy supplier Reliant              Resources Inc. is buying Orion Power Holdings Inc., an East Coast              electric power generating company, for $2.9 billion in cash.             September 28, 2001              -              Gov. Gray Davis calls a third special legislative session, to begin              Oct. 9. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announces October natural gas              bills for its customers should be at least 50 percent lower than last              year.                                                                  October 1, 2001 -              California power plants which postponed routine maintenance and upgrades              in order to keep churning out electricity earlier this year have rescheduled              such work for fall, potentially triggering rolling blackouts if a              heat wave arrives. The state expects to have 9,300 megawatts offline              due to maintenance and environmental restrictions, leaving 36,927              megawatts available during October. Plaintiffs in chemical exposure              cases against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that inspired the movie              ``Erin Brockovich'' still could receive $160 million in settlement              money, though a portion could be delayed by a decade under the utility's              bankruptcy recovery plan. Congressman Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announces              he has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate              the conduct of the Independent System Operator, the agency that manages              the state's power grid. California officials agree the state's general              fund must be repaid for the nearly $9 billion the Department of Water              Resources has paid for electricity, but months-long debates over the              details continue to slow progress. Five major creditors are threatening              to push a second California utility, Southern California Edison, into              bankruptcy, days after Davis called lawmakers back to Sacramento to              craft a rescue plan for Edison. Two consumer groups called on California              Attorney General Bill Lockyer to conduct an ethics probe into a state              contract with an Oklahoma-based energy company. The Consumers Union              and The Utility Reform Network want Lockyer to investigate whether              a 10-year contract with Williams Cos. was tainted because it was negotiated              by one of Gov. Gray Davis' top energy advisers, whose company earned              consulting fees from the deal. If there was a conflict of interest,              the agreement should have been voided or re-negotiated, the groups              allege.             October 2, 2001 -              California power regulators reject a plan governing the issuance of              $12.5 billion in bonds, again delaying efforts to repay the state              general fund for billions of dollars spent on electricity this year.              California power regulators announced an agreement Tuesday with Southern              California Edison Co. that the state says will allow the utility to              pay some $3 billion in debt and help it avoid following Pacific Gas              and Electric Co. into bankruptcy. The settlement was reached by the              Public Utilities Commission over a suit Edison filed in federal court              against the PUC in November 2000, in which Edison said the commission's              refusal to raise electric rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional              taking of its property. Under the settlement, Edison will release              the PUC from all claims. The plan intends to ``restore Edison to creditworthiness              so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its              customers,'' said a release issued by the PUC.                            October 3, 2001 -                Officials with Edison International and Southern California Edison                Co. say the settlement they've negotiated in secret with the Public                Utilities Commission will allow it to retire more than $3 billion                of the utility's nearly $4 billion of debt, allowing it to pay hundreds                of creditors. Attorney General Bill Lockyer files a second round                of state agency claims against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in federal                bankruptcy court, bringing total payments claimed from the utility                to more than $1 billion.                         October 4, 2001 -              Secretary of State Bill Jones unveils an ethics reform plan that he              said will prevent conflict of interests by government officials. The              plan, which Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, plans to sponsor              as legislation next year, would require public officials to file a              statement of economic interest the first day on the job. Paychecks              would be withheld until they are filed. Jones said the proposed rules              are necessary to avoid conflicts of interests such as those revealed              among some of the governor's energy advisers.             October 5, 2001 -              A federal judge approves a settlement designed to keep Southern California              Edison out of bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew calls              the settlement ""fair, adequate and reasonable to the parties,              the shareholders and to the public and is not a bailout by any means.''              The approval came after lawyers for the state's second largest utility              and the state Public Utilities Commission filed papers Thursday urging              Lew to allow the deal to stand. The agreement is designed to allow              Edison to pay off an estimated $3.3 billion of its more than $6 billion              debt by forcing its customers to continue paying higher rates imposed              last May for at least two more years. It also would require Edison's              shareholders to forego $1.2 billion worth of dividends over three              years.             October 9, 2001 -              Lawyers for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. meet in court with a federal              bankruptcy judge, state representatives and lawyersrepresenting thousands              of creditors to craft a timeline of the process by which the utility              could emerge from bankruptcy and pay its debts.             October 10, 2001 -              Curtis L. Wagner, chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission, rules that El Paso Natural Gas Company did              not manipulate the cost of natural gas, although through two subsidiaries              violated federal rules governing the award of natural gas contracts.              The Public Utilities Commission urges the State Treasurer's Office              to obtain an unconditional 90-day waiver or extension of the $4.3              billion interim loan, negotiated by their office, and to consider              the various options for repayment of the interim loan.              October 17, 2001 -              The California Energy Commission votes 3-2 to lift the requirement              that ""peaker plants"" cease operation within three years              or convert to systems that burn much cleaner thus allowing those plants              to run dirtier, ""simple cycle"" turbines throughout their              30-year life. The Commissioners also temporarily waive a rule excluding              developers of ""major"" polluting generators - those typically              emitting 100 tones or more of pollutants a year - from the agency's              fast-track licensing process. These waivers apply to proposed projects              that have license applications completed by December 19 and that can              start operating by next September.             October 18, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces that he is considering renegotiating dozens              of long-term power contracts.             October 19, 2001              -              Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has announced a $300 million project              to add a third power line to California's notorious Path 15, an 84-mile              electricity bottleneck that contributed to the blackouts that hit              the state earlier this year. Reliant Energy Inc. and Mirant Corp.              ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate transactions              between the California Independent System Operator and the California              Department of Water Resources. They are charging California grid operators              with giving preferential treatment and sensitive market information              to state power traders. Edison International, parent of Southern California              Edison, reports a loss of $413 million, due mainly to a $1.15 billion              write down related to the sale of two money-losing coal power plants              in the United Kingdom. By delaying by three months a vote to ban direct              access for utility customers, utility regulators have shifted $8 billion              in energy costs from big businesses to residential and small business              customers, state Treasurer Phil Angelides said today. In a letter              to Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta Lynch, Angelides              said the PUC's delay gave businesses time to sign electricity contracts              outside the utilities.             October 23, 2001 -              Davis begins meetings with staff and state regulators began talks              to break a deadlock over renegotiating power contracts that has stalled              a $12.5-billion bond sale to cover energy costs. PUC President Loretta              Lynch and Commissioner Geoffrey Brown met Monday with Barry Goode,              Davis' legal affairs secretary, to explore options for opening talks              with generators.             October 24, 2001 -              Board of Equalization votes to take over the appraisal of power generators              and to remove the protections of Proposition 13 for large commercial              power plants. Both decisions will become effective January 1, 2003              unless the Legislature can change the law so plants can be assessed              at full market value each year and so cities where plants are located              will get the bulk of the tax money. The Board has asked the Legislature              to consider this issue next year.                            October 29, 2001 -                 U.S. Supreme Court justices                decline to review an appellate court decision that could potentially                expose the state to a limited lawsuit by Pacific Gas and Electric                Company.                          October 30, 2001 -              A federal appeals court temporarily blocks a settlement between Southern              California Edison and state regulators that helps the utility avoid              bankruptcy and keeps higher rates in place through 2003. The stay              is sought by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a San Francisco-based              consumer organization. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has directed              TURN to go back to District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew -- who approved              the settlement earlier this month -- to ask for an injunction until              an appeal can be heard. If Judge Lew decides against the stay, the              Court of Appeals says it may consider one. Governor Gray Davis receives              a total $50,000 in campaign contributions from two out-of-state independent              power producers that sell electricity in California and are involved              in construction of new power plants.             October 31, 2001 -              Officers of Cal-ISO testify before the Senate Select Committee to              Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market to accuse              the DWR of threatening to stop buying power unless provided with exclusive              information about the grid. The officers accuse the state of using              privileged information to schedule controversial, high-priced long-term              energy contracts when lower-priced electricity was available.                                                                 November 1, 2001 -              Californians begin paying a higher interest rate on a $4.3 billion              loan that was used to repay the state treasury for energy purchases.              The state received the loan to tide it over until the $12.5 billion              bond was issued. Since the loan has not been paid back by in a timely              manner, the interest rate will jump almost two percentage points to              about 7.5%, an added cost of about $6.8 million a month.             November 6, 2001              -              Department of Water Resources officials announce a $3 billion reduction              in the estimated cost the state will pay for power through the next              year. The reduction is partly due to a number of commercial customers              fleeing the utilities while the PUC delayed a vote to stop letting              customers choose alternate providers. A special Senate committee questions              Terry Winter, president and chief executive officer of the Independent              System Operator, regarding his decision to ask the Federal Energy              Regulatory Committee to lift the $250-per-megawatt price cap on power              last winter. He testifies that he had defied his bosses and the governor              when he asked federal regulators last December to lift caps on energy              prices because he had made up his mind and didn't want any interference.              San Franciscans vote on two ballot measures that would launch a municipal              utility to replace PG & E as the city's power provider. Measure              I would establish a municipal utility district for San Francisco and              nearby city of Brisbane (similar to SMUD) and Proposition F would              create a water and power agency in San Francisco (similar to LADWP).             November 7, 2001              -              San Francisco voters approve a $100 million revenue bond for solar              and wind energy for government use, as well as a measure allowing              the city to issue future bonds for renewable energy projects without              voter approval. Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the Public Utilities              Commission urge the federal bankruptcy judge reviewing PG & E's              reorganization plan to hold a full-blown trial before acting upon              the utility's request for relief from existing state regulation. The              key point of contention is PG & E's request for the judge to issue              orders that would trump state law and allow it to transfer state-regulated              company assets to new companies not subject to state regulation. Sacramento              Municipal Utility District announces it expects to lift a special              three percent surcharge in May if enough water builds up behind its              dams and power plants along the American River. The Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission orders the California Independent System Operator              to send invoices within 15 days to the state's Department of Water              Resources in an attempt to help power generators collect $1.2 billion              from California for power sales since January.             November 8, 2001 -              The United States Justice Foundation files suit in Sacramento Superior              Court seeking to void $43 billion in long-term energy contracts. The              arguments put forth in the lawsuit are that the contracts run afoul              of California's anti-trust laws and were negotiated and promoted by              state officials with serious conflicts of interest.             November 9, 2001 -              Dynegy Incorporated announces its purchase of Enron Corporation for              $7.8 billion shares of stock.                             November 11, 2001 -                 San Francisco's two energy                initiatives fail by a close margin.                                        November 12, 2001 -                 Department of Water Resources                announces sharp decrease in state spending on energy purchases for                October. Figures show that California spent $415 million on power                purchases in October, half of what it spent in August and $264 million                less than in September. SMUD considers leaving the ISO to set up                its own control area. SMUD officials say the move could save the                utility at least $2 million, and perhaps up to $30 million a year.                Senators Burton, Bowen, and Byron ask the California Energy Commission                to rescind new rules for peaker plants' air emissions, saying the                new rules alter the law approved earlier this year to speed energy                production (see October 17 for CEC decision).                          November 13, 2001              -              A coalition of news organizations settle with the Governor's office              to release to the press short-term and spot-market energy contracts              within 47 days of the end of each contract. A statewide poll reveals              that Californians now rank the energy crisis as the third most important              issue facing the state behind the economy and terrorism. Reliant Energy              and Mirant Corp. accuse the DWR and Cal-ISO of violating federal wholesale              electricity rules before a special Senate hearing.              November 20, 2001              -              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders the Independent System              Operator to stop giving the Department of Water Resources advance              notice of its electricity needs, unless it provides that information              to all market participants. In addition, the commissioners order the              ISO to bill DWR using the same format as it bills its other energy              customers.                            November 26, 2001 -                 Enron employees file a lawsuit                in federal court alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability                and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company                stock for their 401(k) retirement plans. Enron stock has plunged                95% this year.                         November 27, 2001              -              PG&E files a response in bankruptcy court to the state's allegations              that the utility is using the bankruptcy process to profit its parent              company by selling assets to its corporate parent at the public's              expense. Further, PG&E accuses the state and PUC of trying to              stall its reorganization plan.             November 28, 2001              -              Thirty-one proposed projects that would have added more than 3,200              megawatts of electricity by next summer have been held up as officials              of the California Power Authority determine whether the plants are              needed. Dynegy terminated its previously announced $23 billion purchase              of Enron Corp. after Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and Moody's              Investors Service downgraded Enron's debt to junk status. Dynegy cited              Enron's breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements              in the merger agreement as reasons for terminating negotiations. DWR              officials announce that the state's average cost of power this summer              fell from $78 per megawatt in July to $53 in August, $36 in September,              and $34 in October. Officials also add that the average daily power              costs have dropped from a high of $65 million in May to $13.4 million              in October. The US Court of Appeals in San Francisco denies a further              temporary stay thereby allowing the state and Southern California              Edison Co. to start implementing a settlement that lets the utility              keep higher rates in place through 2003. The plan will freeze current              rates for two years, costing customers potential refunds totaling              as much as $3 billion.             November 29, 2001              -              California Public Utilities Commission votes unanimously to give investor-owned              utilities access to about 80% of the $235 million in funding available              for energy efficiency programs for 2002. Businesses and other non-utility              entities can seek the remainder of the funding. An additional $50              million will become available to non-utilities in 2003. PUC President              Loretta M. Lynch reports that energy efficiency programs will receive              less total funding next year.                                                                 December 2, 2001              -              Enron Corp. files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in one of the              largest corporate bankruptcy cases in US history. It also files a              $10 billion breach of contract lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. In addition              to seeking damages, Enron is asking the Bankruptcy Court to prohibit              Dynegy from taking over its Northern Natural Gas pipeline network.             December 3, 2001              -              US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali rejects the state agencies' request              to require PG&E to hold a separate trial to prove that preemption              of California laws to allow the utility to transfer its assets to              a federally regulated affiliate is legally authorized. In related              news, The Utility Reform Network (TURN) is denied permission to participate              in the PG&E bankruptcy case as the official voice of the utility's              customers. Southern California Edison reaches a new agreement to pay              back most of the $400 million it owes renewable energy producers.              The agreement also sets a fixed price of 5.37 cents a kilowatt hour              for Edison to buy electricity from the renewable suppliers over the              next five years. Enron warns that it might be able to service customers              because of its financial problems.              December 5, 2001              -              In a unanimous vote, California Energy Commission rescinds its decisions              exempting ""peaker"" plants, licensed under the four-month              review, from converting to cleaner-burning systems within three years              and temporarily allowing ""major"" polluters to use the agency's              fastest licensing process if they applied by December 19th.              December 6, 2001              -              PG&E agrees to pay back $326.7 million plus 5 percent interest              for power bills that went unpaid for months before it filed for bankruptcy              in April. The utility agrees to make monthly interest and principal              payments for 12 months beginning December 31. FERC suspends its investigation              into whether Enron, Duke Energy, and other power sellers owe California              as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales from October              2000 through January.              December 7, 2001              -              California's state government makes it first payment to the California              Independent System Operator after ordered to pay by Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission. The $404.8 million payment, which covers the              month of February, also covers part of the $955 million owed to power              suppliers for this year's last-minute electricity purchases.             December 11, 2001              -              Calpine Corp. schedules to meet with California officials later this              week to try and renegotiate $13 billion in long-term power contracts              the company signed with the state last spring. The Public Utilities              Commission launches an investigation into the potential impact of              Enron's bankruptcy on the state's energy marketplace and California              customers.             December 27, 2001              -              Bankruptcy judge Dennis Montali approves Pacific Gas & Electric              's proposal to resolve claims of $100,000 or less owed to thousands              of individuals and small businesses. The proposal allows PG&E              to investigate, negotiate, and settle those claims with its creditors              without having to return to the bankruptcy judge or the official creditors'              committee to sign off on the results. Nevertheless, no money can be              paid to those creditors until the utility's overall bankruptcy reorganization              plan clears all the legal hurdles.                                                                                January 2, 2002 -                 The California Public Utilities                Commission votes 4 to 1 to deny the Utility Reform Network's (TURN)                request for a rehearing on the 2001 rate increase. The PUC also                denied a request by PG&E and Edison to reconsider a related                change in how the utilities account for debt. Yet the PUC did decide                to hold a new hearing to end the rate freeze in place since 1998.                U.S. Trustee Linda Stanley decides not to appoint a committee of                local government creditors in addition to the official creditors                committee in the PG&E bankruptcy proceeding.                         January 8, 2001 -              The California Public Utilities Commission asks a federal bankruptcy              judge for permission to file an alternative plan for reorganizing              PG&E. Its plan would block PG&E's attempt to transfer generation              and transmission facilities to new corporate entities and would keep              the utility's operations under PUC regulation. It also calls for fully              repaying the company's creditors within a year. A California Public              Utilities Commission judge proposed dividing $10 billion in energy              purchases nearly equally among all three utilities' customers, which,              compared with earlier proposals, would shift costs away from PG&E              and onto customers of Edison and SDG&E. Under PUC Administrative              Law Judge Pulsifer's proposal, PG&E customers would pay about              $4.8 billion; Edison customers would pay nearly $3.7 billion; and              SDG&E customers would pay nearly $1.6 billion. The plan could              be voted on by the commission as early as February 7.             January 10, 2002 -              Attorney General Bill Lockyer files a lawsuit in Superior Court against              PG&E Corp., the parent of PG&E Co., alleging that it illegally              siphoned as much as $4 billion from the utility, driving it into bankruptcy.              The suit claims that PG&E Corp. violated agreements with state              regulators that were designed to protect the utility and its ratepayers              and seeks to recoup between $600 million and $4 billion; it also seeks              penalties for each alleged improper transfer of funds, which could              amount to at least $500 million.             January 17, 2002 -              Pacific Gas & Electric Co. files a $4.1 billion damage claim with              the State Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board against              the state of California. The claim alleges that the state, through              its passage of AB 6X, has blocked the utility from selling its power              to consumers, at federally regulated rates, until at least 2006 in              direct violation of the state's deregulation agreement with PG&E.                                                               February 7, 2002              -              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali rejects Pacific Gas & Electric              Co.'s reorganization plan stating that federal bankruptcy law does              not automatically override state laws and regulations. He orders PG&E              to respond to the state Public Utilities Commission's alternative              plan, to be proposed next week, and gave PG&E until February 21              to decide whether to revise its plan or appeal Montali's ruling in              federal court.             February 11, 2002              -               The City of San Francisco files suit against Pacific Gas and Electric              Co.'s corporate parent seeking a ratepayer refund of $5 billion. The              City's suit follows the same outline as one filed Jan. 10 by Attorney              General Bill Lockyer. While the Attorney General's suit seeks to return              the money to the utility for distribution to creditors and ratepayers              alike, the City's suit seeks to set the funds aside for PG&E's              4.5 million customers. Senator Barbara Boxer demands that the Federal              Energy Regulatory Commission void the expensive long-term electricity              contracts signed by Governor Gray Davis in response to last year's              energy crisis. Senator Boxer also wants the federal regulators to              order a full refund of the $8.9 billion the state claims it is owed              in overcharges from energy producers.             February 12, 2002              -              The Senate Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale              Energy Market votes to hold Enron Corp. in contempt for the second              time due to failure to produce documents requested by the committee.              The committee also votes to seek criminal charges against the company              for destruction of subpoenaed documents. Violations of the state anti-destruction              laws could result in jail or prison terms for Enron executives.                             February 13, 2002 -                 Federal Energy Regulatory                Commission Chairman Patrick Wood announces the commission decision                to launch a formal fact-finding investigation into whether Enron                Corp. manipulated electricity prices in the West last year.                         February 21, 2002              -              The California Public Utilities Commission approves the State's plan              to sell $11.1 billion in energy bonds. Commissioner Henry Duque, a              Republican opposes the plan. In addition, the Commission approves              a cost-based approach to allocating state power purchases between              the three state utilities. According to its decision, PG&E customers              will pay DWR 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour of power provided, Edison              customers will pay 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and San Diego customers              will pay 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.             February 25, 2002              -              The California Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight              Board file complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              seeking to void $45 billion worth of long-term electricity contracts              signed by Governor Davis last Fall. The agencies allege that the 32              contracts were negotiated at a time when power providers were manipulating              the energy market and resulted in California consumers being overcharged              $21 billion.             February 27, 2002              -              Richard A. Bilas, one of two Republican commissioners on the California              Public Utilities Commission, resigns siting failing health and growing              frustration with current PUC policy as his reasons. U.S. Bankruptcy              Judge Dennis Montali grants the California Public Utilities Commission              permission to submit an alternative reorganization plan in the PG&E              bankruptcy case on or before April 15th. Judge Montali appoints two              mediators in the PG&E bankruptcy case - Anthony Piazza and Marc              Feder - to resolve issues between the state, the utility, and the              creditor committee. Assemblymember Fred Keeley along with a coalition              of consumer groups request the PUC to lower electricity rates about              3.5 cents per kilowatt hour claiming that low generating costs are              allowing PG&E to accumulate large profits at the ratepayers' expense.                                                               March 4, 2002 -              The U.S. Supreme Court upholds a 1996 FERC order that forced electric              utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors, but rejects              an argument that federal regulators did not go far enough in opening              access to transmission grids.             March 5, 2002 -              Governor Gray Davis appoints Michael R. Peevey - former head of Southern              California Edison and husband to Assemblymember Carol Liu - to the              California Public Utilities Commission, effective March 2, 2002. Mr.              Peevey replaces Republican Commissioner Richard Bilas who resigned              last week.             March 7, 2002 -              PG&E files a revised version of its reorganization plan with the              federal bankruptcy court. The plan still contains provisions for transferring              the utility's transmission lines, power plants, hydroelectric dams              and other assets to its parent company -- but reverses PG&E's              position on transferring the watershed lands surrounding its hydroelectric              plants, thus requiring the utility to maintain as much as 60 percent              of the property.                            March 14, 2002 -                The Fair Political Practices Commission fined the Department of                Water Resources $69,500 for conflict of interest violations. This                money is essentially paid by the taxpayers since the DWR was charged                for the violation instead of the people themselves who failed to                file their FPPC reports on time.                         March 21, 2002 -              The Public Utilities Commission voted 3-2 to end private power-purchases              contracts as of September 20, essentially taking away the ratepayers'              right to choose their own power provider.                                                                              April 4, 2002 -                The Public Utilities Commission decided that PG&E will be able                to collect $2.9 billion from its customers this year for electricity                produced by their nuclear and hydroelectric plants and several long-term                power contracts.                         April 24, 2002 -              Federal energy regulators ordered hearings to investigate whether              billions of dollars in long-term power contracts California entered              into during the height of the power crisis are overpriced and should              be scrapped or modified to lower the costs.                                                                              May 6, 2002 -                Assembly adjourns special energy session, second extraordinary.               Internal Enron documents released                today show that traders for the company drove up electricity prices                during the power crisis through questionable practices that may                have contributed to power shortages.                                        May 8, 2002 -                 In response to the released                memos showing Enron's possible market manipulation, the Federal                Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 150 energy trading companies                to hand over documents dealing with their tactics.                                        May 28, 2002 -                 Papers report that California's electric grid operator will                hire an independent investigator to probe allegations it manipulated                the state's energy market.               Dynegy Inc.'s Chief Executive Chuck                Watson resigns today amid questions about the company's energy-trading                business that could have contributed to California's energy crisis.                         May 30, 2002 -               California energy officials declare an alert due to tight electricity              supplies. The alert was called when desert heat in the Southwest caused              out-of-state suppliers to divert some energy that otherwise would              have gone to California. Cal ISO says there is no reason to believe              that there will be any blackouts now or this summer.                                                               June 3, 2002 -               The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules 2-1 that Davis did              not have the authority to take over en estimated $200 million in energy              contracts because Congress has not granted the states such rights              in energy matters.                                                                             July 9, 2002 -                CAL-ISO issues a Stage 1 power alert due to hot weather up and down                the state. Governor Davis reminds Californians to conserve in order                to keep the lights on.                                        July 10, 2002 -                 CAL-ISO issues a Stage 2 power alert. A power plant also broke                down in Southern California, causing a shortage of power.                           July 11, 2002 -               Ross Perot visits the State Capitol today and testifies before              a state Senate committee that his Texas-based firm did not try to              profit from inside knowledge of California's energy market. Senator              Joe Dunn began his investigation of Perot when a 44-page document              surfaced from Perot Systems that revealed flaws in California's power              market."
GX231-13-8349238	"California Stephen P. Sands, Registrar  Licensed Fall 2001  Contractor Gray Davis, Governor  Free, Fast & Fascinating CSLB Contractor Seminars for 2002!  Governor Signs Bills Relating to Contractors  G  T  he Contractors State License Board is currently planning its 2002 Contractor Education Seminar series. To better serve working contractors, the 2002 series will include four weeknight seminars and one Saturday morning seminar to be held January through April 2002 in locations from Sacramento to the San Diego area. Take advantage of this unique opportunity. Each three and one-half hour seminar will include a 70-minute presentation on contract requirements, a Q&A session with a panel of experts and contractor-related exhibits. During the 70-minute presentation Bill Dexter, Risk Management Consultant, veteran CSLB Contractor Ed speaker and former Director of the California Center for Construction Education, College of Architecture and Environmental Design, Cal Poly asks, ""Does Your Contract Measure Up?"" His presentation will be based on the five most common complaints submitted to the Board. The panel of experts will include Board licensing and enforcement deputies, a local building official, and a Cal/OSHA representative. Also, for the first time, the Board has invited local building exchanges, building departments, Cal/OSHA, the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI), and the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), and a construction bookstore to set up exhibits at the seminars. All these organizations can provide a wealth of resources and helpful information. Don't miss your opportunity to attend one of these informative seminars. See page 8 for a list of locations and registration instructions.  overnor Davis recently signed three bills relating to the Contractors State License Board and contractors. Following is a summary of relevant legislation. Each new law becomes effective January 1, 2002, unless otherwise specified. Copies of the bills are available at www.leginfo.ca.gov or through the Legislative Bill Room in the basement of the State Capitol. The phone number is (916) 445-2323. AB 678 (Papan--Chapter 226)  referred for investigation after a Board Enforcement representative has determined that a probable violation occurred and that if proven, the violation would be appropriate cause for license suspension or revocation or criminal prosecution. SB 135 also limits the disclosure period for citations and disciplinary actions (suspensions and revocations). The bill becomes effective July 1, 2002, or as soon thereafter as specified provisions are administratively feasible. SB 724 (Figueroa--Chapter 728)  An extension of existing law that prohibits unlicensed contractors from using California courts to obtain compensation for contracting work, AB 678 further authorizes those who hire unlicensed contractors to seek court action and recovery of compensation they've paid to unlicensed contractors. SB 135 (Figueroa--Chapter 494)  Existing law allows the Board to disclose only those complaints against contractors that have been referred for legal action. SB 135 requires the Board to disclose all complaints that have been  SB 724 is the Contractors Board's ""clean up"" bill and makes multiple revisions to licensing law. Among other provisions, it authorizes the Board's Registrar to use collection agencies to collect civil penalties; limits licensees to one business name per license; and extends the time during which a claim may be made against a licensee's cash deposit (to three years after the expiration of the license). The bill also revises the licensing application and renewal process for misrepresentations or omissions made on the application or renewal form.  New Home Improvement Contractor Disclosure Requirements Delayed  T  he last issue of the California Licensed Contractor reported that, as a result of legislation passed last year (SB 2029), new disclosure requirements could become mandatory for Home Improvement Contractors as early as October 2001. Board staff now expects the new provisions to be filed with the Secretary of State before December 1, 2001 and the regulation will then become effective three months from the filing date. The new disclosure requirements will also require HIC contractors to disclose whether or not they carry Commercial General Liability insurance (CGL) -- and if they do, the name and telephone  number of the insurance company. HIC contractors will also be required to provide a consumer information sheet on the importance of Commercial General Liability Insurance (CGL) along with a form called the ""Checklist for Homeowners,"" which describes the main points of home improvement contracting. Contractors building new single-family homes pursuant to Business & Professions Code Section 7164 will also be expected to provide the CGL notice and disclose whether they carry CGL. CSLB will make the new notices available on its web site or, upon request, by mail as soon as possible after they are filed with the Secretary of State.   California  Licensed  Contractor Board Briefs  John O'Rourke Appointed to CSLB  Anthony Elmo Reappointed to Board  I The California Licensed Contractor  is an official publication of the Contractors State License Board  State of California Gray Davis Governor Aileen Adams Secretary, State and Consumer Services Agency Kathleen Hamilton Director, Department of Consumer Affairs Stephen P.

Hearings Scheduled on License Classifications  A  Home Improvement Certification Update ome improvement contractors become certified as As of November 1, more than 148,300 contractors have obtained Home Improvement Certification. They are the only contractors legally allowed to contract for home improvement work. In fact, many local building departments now refuse permits to contractors without HIC. Subcontractors must also be certified if they want to sub on home improvement contracts.  t its July 2001 meeting, the Board voted to initiate the regulatory process to reinstate the C-6 Cabinet and Millwork classification and relevant exam. The process requires amending the current C-5 Carpentry, Cabinet and Millwork license classification. The Board also voted to amend Board Rule 832.54 (relating to C-54 Tile Contractors) to include the installation of granite and other natural stone for kitchen and bathroom countertops, and Board Rule 832.09 (relating to C-9 Drywall Contractors) to specifically include the application of texturing materials and installation of nonstructural metal studs. Public regulatory hearings on these issues have been scheduled for December 13, 2001, at the Contractors State License Board located at 9821 Business Park Drive, Sacramento. Exact times and additional information on the hearings will be available on the Board's web site at www.cslb.ca.gov as soon as possible.

There are 55 Habitat for Humanity affiliates in California, so there is sure to be one near you. Often, several affiliates located in the same region are in various stages of building. This means licensed contractors can make the best use of their skills by picking a project based on the stage of construction. Donated professional labor, support, and even supplies of licensed contractors play a vital role in producing Habitat homes and are critical components of Habitat's ability to sell these homes at prices affordable to families with extremely low incomes. Through partnerships with licensed contractors, construction professionals, local volunteers and other community businesses and organizations, labor and material donations support the affordable construction of Habitat homes. Since its inception in 1976, Habitat for Humanity and its local affiliates have built thousands of decent, affordable homes and sold them at no profit and with zero-percent interest loans to lowincome families who, until then, had lived in unsafe, deteriorated, and substandard housing. Because their low incomes would prevent them from obtaining traditional mortgages, home ownership is an otherwise unattainable dream for the families who buy these homes. Each family selected to purchase a Habitat home contributes 500 hours of ""sweat equity"" to their community as they work to build their Habitat home and those of other Habitat families. Through the united efforts and personal investment of people throughout the community, neighborhoods and communities become more cohesive, integrated and revitalized. While contributing ""sweat equity,"" Habitat families also learn to care for and maintain their new homes. For more information about the Habitat affiliate nearest you and their current projects, visit www.habitatforhumanity.org or call Habitat for Humanity's Western Region at (800) 228-6407.

How do leads turn into action, and who hunts down illegal activity? This complex task belongs to the Board's investigative staff at its eight Investigative Centers and the Statewide Investigative Fraud Team (SWIFT).  E  and pose as homeowners interested in contracting for a variety of home improvement projects. Unlicensed contractors advertising in local print media are then contacted by the agents and invited to bid on various jobs at the sting site. If an unlicensed contractor submits a bid of more than $500 (for labor and materials) for any job, he has broken license law. Perpetrators are usually arrested and given a Notice to Appear in criminal court.  Investigators scour print media for contracting advertisements that do not include a license number (usually an indication that the contractor is not licensed). Investigators then determine the contractor 's license status and issue appropriate administrative citations.  Educational Outreach Seminars Investigators present approximately 10 educational seminars throughout the state each month. Contractors, law enforcement personnel, consumers and other groups are educated on how to hire licensed contractors, identify unlicensed activity and avoid scams.  While Investigative Center personnel investigate consumer complaints of inferior work performed by unlicensed contractors, the SWIFT unit--comprised of 27 investigators statewide, several of whom possess powers of arrest--uses a variety of proactive investigative techniques to deter unlicensed contracting. All told, CSLB investigators referred 723 unlicensed contractors for criminal prosecution and issued another 1,015 administrative citations during the 2000 Fiscal Year (July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001). Many of the techniques SWIFT uses to locate and snare unlicensed activity are detailed below.  Sweeps On average, 10 sweeps are conducted statewide, each month. After traveling to areas dense with active construction, investigators visit numerous job sites and issue administrative citations to contractors unable to produce their licenses. Many sweeps are coordinated in conjunction with the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement and the Employment Development Department. Each of these state organizations routinely performs job site checks to curtail the underground economy. SWIFT staff focuses on unlicensed contracting, failure to pay state taxes and employers' Workers' Compensation Insurance coverage.  Hot Tips Board staff receives an average of 25 reports of known or suspected unlicensed contracting activity in California each day. Approximately eighty percent of these leads are investigated and result in some form of disciplinary action. If you have knowledge of or suspect unlicensed contracting activity in your area and would like to report it to SWIFT, you may report the lead or request a Lead Sheet in Southern California by calling (562) 466-6017 or (562) 466-6018. In Northern California call (916) 255-2924. Important Note: Leads may be called in anonymously and confidentially and need not involve paperwork. They may be submitted verbally over the phone.  Stings An average of five undercover sting operations are conducted throughout the state each month. Each sting requires undercover investigators to set up at a predetermined home site  Boiler Room The Boiler Room is used in geographical locations rich with construction.  Paying Wages ""Under the Table"" . . . Is it Worth the Risk? hen employers disguise wage payments to avoid associated payroll taxes and insurance expenses, create an unfair competitive advantage, and/or reduce bookkeeping burdens, they take on a huge financial and legal risk. The financially dangerous and illegal practice of paying employee wages ""under the table"" can actually be very costly and time consuming in the end. Many employers do not realize that when they are caught paying wages under the table, their state payroll tax liability can be 20 times more than if they had voluntarily reported the employee's wages and paid the associated payroll taxes and insurance. When audited, employers who pay wages under the table will be unable to prove the number of employees and will, therefore, be unable to take advantage of certain tax and insurance 4  W  limits that apply to each employee. Higher tax and insurance bills will result when those expenses are assessed on the full payroll.  not been correctly reported, their insurance benefits may be delayed or denied and an EDD investigation will follow. Wage payments made under the table often violate labor laws, too, which in turn can cost the business thousands of dollars in penalties. When under the table wages are discovered, both the employer and employee are subject to applicable state and federal income tax audits. However, when an employer fails to withhold employee-paid taxes, those taxes become the employer 's responsibility. For more information about payroll tax reporting, contact the Employment Tax Customer Service Office in your local EDD office. To report instances of cash wages paid ""under the table"" call (800) 528-1783. If you wish to remain anonymous, you need not provide your name.  Paying employee wages under the table can actually be very costly and time consuming in the end. Regardless of whether or not other businesses in your industry pay wages under the table, the practice is illegal. When caught, employers who pay wages under the table may also face criminal prosecution. If an employee asks you to hide his or her wages, deny the request. You are legally obligated to report the wages and withhold payroll taxes. Furthermore, if your employee is injured on or off the job they have the right to file a claim for Worker 's Compensation or State Disability Insurance benefits. If their wages have   California  Licensed  Contractor What Would You Do?  CSLB Industry Experts Offer Concrete Advice for C-8 Contractors  C  SLB Industry Expert Mario M. Leon realized that many of the complaints he reviews pertain to cracks in concrete. In an effort to minimize these complaints and resulting actions against the contractors, Mr. Leon wrote in with the following suggestion for placing control joints (commonly called scorelines). ""The American Concrete Institute recommends placing control joints at maximum intervals of 30 times the slab thickness. For instance, a three inch thick concrete slab would require a control joint at 7.5 foot maximum intervals in either direction (.25 feet X 30 = 7.5 feet), while a four inch thick slab would require a control joint at 9.9 foot maximum intervals (.33 feet X 30 = 9.9 feet). Often, the homeowner wants to minimize control joints and convinces the contractor to place them beyond the recommended distance. If the specifications have not been placed in the contract, the contractor often receives an unfavorable ruling when the concrete cracks."" A Building Official for the southern California cities of Fountain Valley and Paramount, Howard Larnard notes that Mr. Leon's suggestion is just one of many ways to address the problem of concrete cracking and crazing (light, surface-level cracks). He notes that concrete made with a lower water-tocement ratio will not need as many control joints because it will be inherently stronger and shrink less. A lower water-to-cement ratio can be achieved by adjusting the amount of each ingredient in the concrete. For example, if the contractor reduces the volume of sand and increases the cement content while using the same amount of water, the result will be a lower water-to-cement ratio and stronger concrete. ""Obviously, using more cement in the mix will cost more. Therefore, clear communication in the contract is imperative. The contract should contain cement specifications, control joint placement, applicable reinforcement and the expectations of the concrete performance,"" he explains. The quality and consistency of concrete batching and placement for slabs-onground is also a factor in cracking. Industry Expert Steve Maragakis states, ""For slabs-on-ground (also called slab-  on-grade), preventing or controlling defects is better accomplished with an understanding of the material and its limitations. Typical concrete poured for residential applications will shrink about five-eighths inch per 100 linear feet. Stress created by the volume change and restraints of underlying soils causes concrete pavement to break at regular intervals."" Adding reinforcement such as steel or mesh may also help reduce cracking caused by soil movement. Whether used to build walls, sidewalks or patios, concrete construction is one of the most technically varied specialties in the construction field.

M  any contractors have written with a response to the anonymous question posed in the summer CLC. Their responses are below. Q: ""Most design/build projects involve a design (floor plan) which I provide. Once accepted by the homeowner, contract specifications are written, the contract is signed and I collect a deposit. The drawings often cost more than the $1,000 deposit. If the homeowner decides to cancel the project and forego the deposit, I am often left holding the bag, and the bill, for the working drawings. Is there anything I can do as a design/build contractor to receive full payment from the homeowner for working drawings before I pay for them? I want to avoid having to go through the legal system after the fact."" A: ""The next time you have a design/ build project, I would suggest providing drawings for an agreed price ahead of time. That way whether you do the construction portion of the work or not, you will be compensated for the design drawings. As an incentive to the homeowner, you might even offer the design fee towards the construction cost, if you are awarded the job. An example would be offering the drawings for $1,000, which would be credited toward the job if you were awarded the contract. If they decided to cancel the project, then you still get the $1,000 for the design fees. Just remember to agree on this in writing before providing any drawings to a homeowner."" --Josh W. Shields, Laguna Beach A: ""I charge my customers an up-front, non-refundable design fee. The amount is based upon the complexity of the project. I have them sign a one-page ""Design Agreement"" which explains what they are getting and what is not included. The agreement states that the fee will be off-set against the cost of the job should they elect to hire me, less out of pocket expenses such as travel and postage. The design fee is not to be confused with the job deposit."" --Pat Wallen, San Rafael A: ""Stop giving away your time--you will go broke in no time. You can give a free estimate to your clients, but how do you do that with no drawings? You must set up a preliminary design contract where you get paid for your design time.

The contract should reimburse the homeowner money not charged or apply the credit towards the building project. This will weed out the serious clients from the ones that just want to use your resources for free. Even if they cancel the project you are still covered for your design work."" --Victoria Foster, Wilton, CA A: ""The approach we use that seems to have been successful for many years is to use an ""Intent Agreement"" for the final bid and contract package along with the working drawings. The way we work it is as follows. I will go out and look at a project and briefly discuss with the homeowner what their needs and desires are, indicating to them that the estimate will be an approximate figure based on a brief meeting and time spent on the estimate. This cuts my time for the estimate (which is free) to a minimum. If the budget allows and the homeowner decides to proceed, we will enter into an ""Intent Agreement"" for which they will pay, as per the agreement, a fee for the plans to be drawn, final estimate, specifications, and the contract to do the work. If the customer decides to go ahead with the project, we will enter into the ""Contract"" phase of the project; if not, I have been paid for my time and they can let the project out for bid elsewhere. Our agreement provides for us to retain design rights to the plans, but fees may be adjusted if you want to give the right to the customer to use your plans for the final project (they probably will anyway). The safety valve created by doing it this way is that there seems to be less pressure on the customer to feel obligated to enter into a contract if they feel that they can get out without feeling obligated. The upside for us is that if through the design phase, we decide that there is a personality conflict with the customer, we know it before we enter into a contract with someone that we don't really want to work with. Another plus is that by spending the time on something that you know you are being paid for, you will be more careful in the design, specifications, contract terminology and project description. By eliminating any gray areas, there seems to be a better customer-contractor relationship throughout the project."" --George VanDusen, Orangevale If you have an answer to the question above or would like fellow contractors to answer one of your questions, send your comments to the editor at Gina Crawford, CSLB, P.O.

Yosemite Planning Page                  Chapter VI: Consultation and Coordination    Compliance  History    Environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of resources did not exist when the Cascades Diversion Dam was constructed in 1917. Environmental compliance for Cascades Diversion Dam began in 1982, when alternatives for managing the future of the hydroelectric generating facility were considered. An overview of environmental compliance documents completed pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act that relate to Cascades Diversion Dam are presented below.    Hydroelectric Power System Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1982). The purpose of this document was to study and evaluate alternatives for approaching the future of the then 62-year-old hydroelectric generating facility. Alternatives included retaining, replacing, enlarging, and abandoning the system. The preferred alternative proposed repairs, replacements, and a slight increase in capacity.    Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987b). The purpose of this document was to consider alternative proposals for the removal of the abandoned Cascades Diversion Dam and the restoration of the dam site to natural conditions.    Addendum to the Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987a). This document provided additional data on the removal of Cascades Diversion Dam. The addendum concluded that further environmental analysis would be required to make an informed decision on the method and extent of dam removal. Consequently, removal of the dam was eliminated from the project.    Finding of No Significant Impact, Phase II Replacement of the Electrical Distribution System in  Yosemite Valley  (NPS 1987c). The Finding of No Significant Impact described replacement of the electrical distribution system within  Yosemite Valley .    Finding of No Significant Impact, Electrical Distribution System Replacement  (NPS 1988). The Finding of No Significant Impact presented the preferred alternative described in the  Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987b), excluding removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and attendant structures.    Merced  Wild and  Scenic River  Comprehensive Management Plan  ( Merced River  Plan) (NPS 2001a). The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions, typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The Merced River Plan applies to any project that is within the Wild and  Scenic   River  boundary, or that would affect the Outstandingly Remarkable Values or free-flowing condition of the river. Removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam complies with the intent of the Merced River Plan to protect and enhance free-flowing conditions.           Yosemite Valley Plan  (NPS 2000a). The National Park Service recently developed the  Yosemite Valley Plan  to implement the goals of the  General Management Plan  in  Yosemite Valley . The  Yosemite Valley Plan  is designed to meet the resource preservation and visitor experience goals in  Yosemite Valley , and calls out specific actions to meet these goals. Among the actions identified in the  Yosemite Valley Plan  is removal of Cascades Diversion Dam.    Scoping  History    On  April 18, 2001 , the National Park Service held an informal public scoping meeting to discuss the potential removal of Cascades Diversion Dam. The meeting included project orientation, group discussion, and a visit to the dam site to view the existing conditions. The purpose of the informal public scoping meeting was to: (1) provide participants with an overview of existing conditions and the proposed action; (2) ask participants to identify key issues that should be analyzed during the environmental review and compliance process; and (3) provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions regarding project alternatives and the overall environmental review and compliance process. Public scoping comments were accepted through  April  27, 2001 .      Over 75 public scoping comments were received. All comments were reviewed and analyzed to determine public concerns. In addition, the National Park Service posts a project fact sheet and project planning updates on the park’s web site. Project planning updates have also been presented at ongoing open house meetings and in the park’s planning update newsletter. Based on public scoping comments and applicable federal law, regulations, and executive orders, the National Park Service determined that an environmental assessment (not an en environmental impact statement) would be the appropriate level of compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project. Public scoping comments and issues raised by National Park Service staff were used in the alternatives development process and the analysis presented in this document.    Agency  Consultation    U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a Special Site Permit for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project in conjunction with preparation of the  El Portal Road Improvements Environmental Assessment  in 1997. In December 2002, the National Park Service requested an extension on the timeline of the permit for dam removal activities. The extended permit would be valid only for actions related to dam removal and not for future  El Portal   Road  improvements. In addition, the National Park Service notified the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was a discrete project from the future El Portal Road Improvement Project and would not include road improvements. The extended permit would be in place prior to implementation of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.    Central Valley  Regional Water Quality Control Board    The National Park Service is currently coordinating with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to obtain required permits. The National Park Service may be required to submit a report of waste discharge, and obtain Waste Discharge Requirements or an individual waiver. Copies of the existing waste discharge waiver are on file at  Yosemite National Park . The permit would be in place prior to implementation of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.    U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service    The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 United States Code 1531 et seq.), requires all federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency does not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or critical habitat. The National Park Service requested a list of federally listed endangered and threatened species that may be present in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project area from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on  September 23, 2002 . The list received from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on  September 27, 2002  was used as a basis for the special-status analysis in this environmental assessment (see Appendix D, Special-Status Species Evaluation). Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will continue, as defined by Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as environmental compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is finalized.    California   State  Historic Preservation Officer/Advisory Council on Historic Preservation    Cascades Diversion Dam has been the subject of previous evaluation and mitigation actions, as described at the beginning of this chapter. In 1986, the National Park Service evaluated the impacts associated with the demolition, relocation, and/or rehabilitation of all components of the Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant (also known as the Cascades Powerhouse). This evaluation included the removal of the dam. With the completion of this evaluation, the National Park Service completed the consultation process associated with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. As part of this process, the National Park Service signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the California State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. A copy of the memorandum is located at the end of this chapter. The memorandum identified stipulations for dam removal, including the preparation of Historic American Engineering Report documentation, the submittal of archival photographs and narrative to the State Historic Preservation Officer and the  Fresno    Metropolitan   Museum , and the development of an accurate scale model of the entire  Merced  River  hydroelectric system. The National Park Service has complied with the various stipulations of the Memorandum of Agreement and has sent a letter to the State Historic Preservation Officer indicating that the Section 106 consultation process is complete.    In addition to compliance with stipulations of the 1986 Memorandum of Agreement, removal of the dam would also comply with the requirements in Appendix E (Adverse Effects and Standard Mitigation Measures for Historical Properties) of the  Yosemite Valley Plan . These requirements are included in the 1999 Programmatic Agreement between the National Park Service, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation for the “Resolution of Adverse Effects” associated with planning, construction, operations, and maintenance activities within  Yosemite  National Park.           American Indian Consultation    As part of the development of the  Draft  and  Final Yosemite Valley Plan/SEIS,  the National Park Service consulted with the following park-associated, federally recognized tribes and nonfederally recognized American Indian communities who refer to themselves as “tribes”: the American Indian Council of Mariposa County, Inc.; the North Fork Mono Rancheria; the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians; the Chukchansi Tribal Government; the Mono Lake Indian Community; the Bridgeport Paiute Indian Colony; and the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council. These consultations were ongoing throughout the planning process for the  Yosemite Valley   Implementation Plan/SEIS  and will continue through the design and implementation phases for activities taking place under the  Yosemite Valley Plan . At present, the National Park Service is consulting with seven American Indian tribes and groups regarding such as issues access for traditional use, gathering of traditional materials, protection and mitigation of impacts to traditional cultural resources, and preservation and management of important cultural places.    Between June 28, 2000 and July 17, 2000, National Park Service representatives met with representatives from seven tribal groups associated with Yosemite National Park. Since July of 2000, tribal consultation has been ongoing regarding concerns associated with the proposed project. Recently, the National Park Service requested that the Southern Sierra Miwok identify concerns regarding plant gathering within the river corridor between Cascades Diversion Dam and Cascades Picnic Area.    Future  Information    Updated information about various aspects of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will be periodically distributed via newsletters, mailings, the  Yosemite   National   Park  web site ( www.nps.gov/yose/planning ), and regional and local news media. There will be a 30-day public comment period on the environmental assessment.

GX226-40-16176801	For Immediate Release:  May 1, 2003        Contact:  Daryl Savage         Phone:  (650) 688-6330                                                  Simitian Seeks To Limit Cruise Ship Dumping        “Clean Coast” Legislation Addresses Air And Water Pollution                               Palo Alto – A pair of “Clean Coast” environmental bills to reduce air pollution and the amount of sewage dumped from cruise ships made headway this week after both bills passed in the Assembly Environmental Safety Committee. The legislation, introduced by Assemblymember Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), seeks to strictly regulate cruise ship waste along the California coast.           The proposed crackdown on dumping waste comes in the wake of increased concern by environmental groups about dangerous toxins being discharged by large vessels on the California coastline and its sanctuaries, including Monterey Bay.                  Simitian’s first piece of Clean Coast legislation, Assembly Bill 121, prohibits cruise ships from discharging specific kinds of waste, including raw sewage, bilge and ballast water, which threaten both water quality and wildlife along the coast and sanctuaries. The recent surge in cruise ship popularity and the opening of ports in San Francisco and Monterey for cruise line travel also has the potential to pose a public safety risk to swimmers and beach-goers.                 “It’s a double-edged sword. I’m happy to see the cruise business expanding into Northern California, but we’ve got to set limits on the amount and type of waste these ships discharge in the water. It’s the coastal ecosystem that’s at risk,” Simitian said.                 Specifically, Simitian seeks to prohibit dumping waste within three miles of the California coastline. Sewage and toxic chemicals are currently being dumped too close to shore, according to Simitian. And the problem with ballast water is that the discharge often contains microscopic organisms picked up in foreign ports of call. When ballast water is released in the Bay Area, it can disrupt local coastal ecosystems. “This practice has the potential to seriously threaten local species of fish and wildlife,” Simitian said. “It’s the kind of damage that, once done, is exceedingly hard to undo.”                 The bill further requires cruise ship owners and operators to submit a quarterly report detailing the contents of what they discharge into the coastal waters.                 A typical seven-day cruise can generate 50 tons of garbage and more than 200,000 gallons of sewage, according to Bluewater Network, a San Francisco–based environmental group, who is a sponsor of Simitian’s bill.  One passenger generates about 10 gallons of pure sewage a week, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. “Multiply that by the number of people on cruise ships, upwards of 3,000 individuals, and in some cases you’ve literally got tons of waste floating in the water,” Simitian said.                 “Backpackers have known for years that when ‘you hike it in, you hike it out.’ The cruise ship industry needs to learn this lesson. Assemblyman Simitian’s legislation will force cruise ships to do exactly that,” said Russell Long, Executive Director for Bluewater Network.                 The bill prohibits dumping biological and chemical wastes, hazardous substances, sewage, industrial waste, medical waste, munitions, ballast, oil, radioactive materials, solid wastes, toxic wastes, and wrecked or discarded equipment.                 Simitian’s other bill in the Clean Coast pair, Assembly Bill 471, concentrates on the volume of air pollution emitted by fuel from cruise ships.                  When a cruise ship is at port, such as San Francisco Bay, it emits the same amount of pollution as 12,200 cars, according to Monterey Bay Air Pollution Control District. Additionally, the South Coast Air Quality Management District reported a 71% cancer risk from toxic air pollution in Los Angeles, a significant portion of which comes from ocean vessels.                  “Another problem is the incineration of garbage on cruise ships,” Simitian said. The legislation will prohibit on-board incineration of garbage within 90 miles of the coastline. This, in turn, will further decrease the amount of air pollution emitted by cruise ships. AB 471 also addresses the type of fuel a large vessel can utilize. Only low-sulfur diesel fuel can be used within 25 miles of the California coast.                 The Clean Coast bills are sponsored by Bluewater Network. Additional supporters include: Oceana, Natural Resources Defense Council, Save Our Shores, Ocean Conservancy, Surfrider Foundation, WaterKeepers, San Franciscans For a Healthy Waterfront, Friends of the Sea Otter, Sierra Club (Ventana Chapter), American Cetacean Society (Monterey Chapter), Carmel-by-the-Sea Councilmember Barbara Livingston, and District 1-PCD, Meba AFL-CIO, which is the oldest maritime union in the United States.                 Assemblymembers George Nakano (D-Torrance) and John Laird (D-Santa Cruz) are joint authors on AB 121 and AB 471. Simitian is also a joint author on AB 906, which regulates the discharge of “gray water” by cruise ships.                                                                                                                                                     ###

TOD can be new construction or redevelopment of one or more buildings whose design and orientation facilitate transit use.""  Technical Advisory Committee to the Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study   Overview This study has taken a comprehensive look at the `state-of-the-practice' of transit-oriented development (TOD) in California and across the United States. This 14-month study began in September, 2000 and was completed early in 2002. The major objectives of this study were to: Define transit-oriented development and its successful components; describe the potential benefits of TOD; examine the status of implementation of TOD in the U.S. and California; identify the major barriers and impediments to the wider implementation of TOD; identify what is working well, as well as the need for additional resources to overcome barriers; and, finally, develop a set of potential strategies and activities that the state of California may implement to facilitate the broader implementation of TOD in this state. The study was guided by two advisory committees that included representatives of state and local government agencies, transit providers, private developers, financial institutions, environmental groups, and others. (Members of these committees are listed inside the back cover). It also involved interviews with private developers and with staff members of numerous local jurisdictions, transit agencies, and other organizations. This process has resulted in the publication of a final report, ""Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study: Factors for Success in California"", that contains up-to-date and practical information on TOD. Separate from the final report, a Technical Appendix volume contains: an overview of TOD in America; detailed information about twelve TODs in California; information on funding sources; and other resources. In addition, the study team produced a special report that examines parking in TODs. All of these reports are available, at: http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/MassTrans/tod.htm Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary 1  The American Plaza in downtown San Diego, CA Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) in San Diego has TOD projects and plans in place at over 15 of the system's 49 light-rail stations  TOD is an effective strategy to help manage California's growth and improve its quality of life.   From 1990 to 2000, California invested approximately 14 billion dollars on mass transportation Richmond Transit Village, Richmond, CA The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) has set aside $54 million in flexible federal funds for the Transportation for Livable Communities Program (TLC). Whisman Station, Mountain View, CA The City of Mountain View in the San Francisco Bay Area has taken a leadership role in providing a framework for TOD. Calthorpe Associates  What is Transit-Oriented Development? TOD is a strategy that has broad potential in both large urban and small communities using bus or rail transit systems. It focuses compact growth around transit stops, thereby capitalizing on transit investments by bringing potential riders closer to transit facilities and increasing ridership. TOD can also produce a variety of other local and regional benefits by encouraging walkable compact and infill development. Transit agencies often play an important role in TOD. Local governments can play a significant role in promoting TOD through plans, policies, zoning provisions, and incentives for supportive densities, designs, along with a mix of land uses. For development to be transit-oriented, it needs to be more than just adjacent to transit. Development generally needs to be shaped by transit in terms of parking, density, and/or building orientation in comparison to conventional development for it to be considered transit-oriented. A successful TOD will reinforce both the community and the transit system. Successful TOD implementation typically involves a number of elements such as: optimal transit system design; community partnerships; understanding local real estate markets; planning for TOD; coordination among local, regional, and state organizations; and providing the right mix of planning and financial incentives and resources.  Why TOD in California? Over the next 20 years, California is expected to add 11-16 million new residents and over four million new households. This unprecedented growth is more than California experienced during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, combined. California's success at managing this growth will determine its future prosperity, the quality of its environment, and overall quality of life for its residents. TOD is a strategy to help manage this growth and improve California's quality of life. TOD provides communities with an alternative to the consequences of low-density suburban sprawl and automobile- dependent land use patterns. In addition, TOD can help answer California's dramatic need for more affordable housing.  2 California Department of Transportation   TOD Profile: Ohlone-Chynoweth, San Jose Ohlone-Chynoweth on the Guadalupe Light Rail line in San Jose includes housing and community facilities developed on an under used light-rail park-andride lot. The former 1,100space park-andride lot now includes a variety of uses: 240 park-and-ride spaces, 330 units of affordable housing, 4,400 sq. ft. of retail, and a day care center. At 27 dwelling units per acre, the residential density is relatively high compared to the single family neighborhood nearby. The $31.6 million project included $14.5 million in tax-exempt bonds, $10.5 million in tax credit equity, a $5.2 million loan from the City to support affordable housing, $824,000 in federal transportation funds for improvements, a $500,000 Affordable Housing grant, and $350,000 State Proposition 1 funds to reimburse the school fee.  Parsons Brinckerhoff  Posey's Corner, Sacramento, CA Sacramento Regional Transit has recast its role in transitoriented development with a major TOD planning program  underway for the eastward Folsom Corridor and South Line light-rail extensions.  Need for Mobility Options By aligning transit investments with a community's vision for how it wants to grow, TOD seeks to create mixed-use, denser, walkable ""transit villages"". By implementing TOD, California can make significant progress towards improving its quality of life by coordinating investments in transportation and land use projects. The Federal Transit Administration now gives priority for funding of proposed rail transit projects to areas with transitsupportive land use policies and practices. If California expects to be able to successfully compete nationwide for limited federal rail transit funds, we need to pay attention to implementing TOD. Accompanying significant population and employment growth is the concern over increasing traffic congestion and lengthening commute times. From 1990 to 2000, as the state's population grew by 13.6%, the average time people spent commuting increased by nearly 4% . That trend is expected to increase into the future. From 1990 to 2000, the state of California invested approximately 14 billion dollars of state funds on mass transportation programs and projects. These investments, along with California's congested roads and freeways, have helped reverse a long trend of decline in transit ridership.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  3   Several demographic trends are expected to contribute favorably to the market demand for T ransit-Oriented Development Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative  North Hollywood Transit Park, Los Angeles, CA BEFORE The City of Los Angeles adopted ""A Transportation/Land Use Policy for Los Angeles,"" in 1993 to guide TOD planning. TOD  AFTER plans have been adopted for four Red Line subway stations and several stations on the Pasadena Blue light-rail line.  California's transit use is increasing 40% faster than the average national rate. In 1999, two of California's transit systems had the hightest increases in ridership in the nation. However, despite California's impressive investment in transit, most of California's future growth will likely continue to follow typical ""sprawl"" development patterns. The result would be higher costs of local services, continued loss of farmland and open space, and increased dependence on automobiles. Consequently, the total number of annual `vehicle miles traveled' in California is expected to increase from 296 billion miles in 2000 to 400 billion miles by 2020, a 33% increase. 4 California Department of Transportation  What are the Benefits of TOD? The results of this study indicate that implementing TOD can have significant benefits to individuals, communities, regions, and the state as a whole. (The extent that these benefits are realized depends on whether developments have the primary characteristics of TOD, as well as on the type and quality of transit service available.) Ten major areas of benefits from TOD are:  TOD can provide mobility choices. By creating ""activity nodes"" linked by transit, TOD provides important mobility options, very much needed in the state's most congested metropolitan areas. This also allows young people, the elderly, people who prefer not to drive, and those who don't own cars the ability to get around. TOD can increase public safety. By creating active places that are busy through the day and evening and providing ""eyes on the street"", TOD helps increase safety for pedestrians, transit-users, and many others. TOD can increase transit ridership. TOD improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our transit service investments by increasing the use of transit near stations by 20 to 40 percent.   TOD Profile: Pleasant Hill, BART Station Area TOD planning for the Pleasant Hill BART station in Contra Costa County is now entering its second generation following the initial Specific Area Plan developed in the 1980s. Following a charette process the County, BART and the community reached a consensus in March 2001 to turn BART's 18-acre surface parking lot into a TOD. Lennertz and Coyle Associates Lennertz and Coyle Associates  Housing at Hazard Station, San Diego, CA The City of San Diego has been a willing partner in supporting both mass transportation and TOD. The City was one of the first  in the nation to adopt ""Transit-Oriented Development Design Guidelines"" in 1992.  TOD can reduce rates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Vehicle travel in California has increased faster than the state's population for years. TOD can lower annual household rates of driving by 20 to 40% for those living, working, and/or shopping near transit stations. TOD can increase households' disposable income. Housing and transportation are the first and second largest household expenses, respectively. TOD can free-up disposable income by reducing driving costs; saving $3-4,000 per year for each household.  TOD reduces air pollution and energy consumption rates. By providing safe and easy pedestrian access to transit, TOD can lower rates of air pollution and energy consumption. Also, TODs can reduce rates of greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5 to 3.7 tons per year for each household. TOD can help conserve resource lands and open space. Because TOD consumes less land than low-density, auto-oriented growth, it reduces the need to convert farmland and open spaces to development.  The draft project proposal includes: 411,000 square feet of office space, up to 345 apartments and townhouses (up to 50 forsale units) a town square and community green, a child care facility, and about 40,000 square feet of ground floor retail and restaurants. All 1,477 of BART's commuter parking spaces would be replaced in structured parking. Subject to negotiations, the Redevelopment Agency will finance the replacement of BART parking, be a partner in the long-term lease and will receive a proportionate share of the revenues.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  5   TOD Profile: EmeryStation, Emeryville EmeryStation is a 20-acre mixed-use TOD anchored by a busy Amtrak station. The site is a former contaminated `brownfield' located in the East Before Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. The developer, Wareham Properties, and the City provided the leadership to implement the After project. The project includes reuse of old industrial buildings and new construction. The project was initiated by Amtrak (Capital Corridor), which was interested in locating a train station in Emeryville. Amtrak offered to pay lease expenses for a station. Wareham agreed to build a new rail station on land leased from the city. In 1998, construction began on Emery Station Plaza, a three-building, 550,000 square foot mixed-use complex on the north, east, and south sides of the Amtrak station. Approximately 150 units of owner-occupied loft and town home developments, plus a senior housing project, have been constructed. At build-out, the investment in EmeryStation is estimated to total $200 million. 6 California Department of Transportation  Wareham Properties  San Francisco Embarcadero Light-Rail Transit San Francisco Muni is entering into its first joint development project following the construction of a new light-rail line to the  South Beach area. A 65-year ground lease is expected to generate $311 million in revenue for Muni, while an additional $540 million in other taxes will flow into the City of San Francisco.  TOD can play a role in economic development. TOD is increasingly used as a tool to help revitalize aging downtowns and declining urban neighborhoods, and to enhance tax revenues for local jurisdictions. TOD can decrease infrastructure costs. Depending on local circumstances, TOD can help reduce overall infrastructure costs for expanding water, sewage and roads to local governments by up to 25% through more compact and infill development.  TOD can contribute to more affordable housing. TOD can add to the supply of affordable housing by providing lower-cost and accessible housing, and by reducing household transportation expenditures. Housing costs for land and structures can be significantly reduced through more compact growth patterns.  Parsons Brinckerhoff   What is the market for TOD? In California and across America, a number of TODs have been built and are performing well in the marketplace. This indicates that the viability of TOD at many locations in today's California real estate market is not a significant concern. However, at the same time, there are still not sufficient financial resources to implement TOD at a large number of transit stations in California. This is particularly true for building affordable housing and parking structures. Mixed-use TODs remain a challenge to finance and implement. And TODs with a retail element historically have proven to be the most challenging in two regards  for financial performance and for adherence to TOD design principals.  Several broad demographic trends influencing California's future are expected to contribute favorably to the market demand for TODs. For housing, these trends not only include unprecedented population and household growth, but a shortfall of housing production and a significant need for housing that is affordable to many households in  California. Regarding employment, recent trends include increased numbers of jobs, particularly in the state's major metropolitan areas. These trends, along with a growing demand for urban housing that offers reduced commute times and urban amenities, point to increasing market demand for TOD projects, especially within the state's major metropolitan areas. Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  TrizecHahn Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects  Trends Point to Increasing Demand  Hollywood/Highland, Los Angeles, CA The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has focused its efforts on joint development of agency-  owned properties, resulting in projects such as Hollywood/ Highland near a Red Line subway station.  TrizecHahn Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects  7   Solid track record. Develop a solid track record for implementing projects and conduct accurate market studies. Multiple sources of capital. Having multiple capital sources with varying investment timelines allows a development to satisfy the higher rate of return on some short-term capital sources. There are only a handful of private or public capital sources specifically targeted to TOD, and those sources have a tendency to be modest in scale. Not surprisingly, successful TOD projects are often funded from sources that are available to a variety of projects. TODs in California with affordable housing typically rely on seven or more funding sources. For example, the Fruitvale Transit Village in Oakland has 20 different sources of funds, all with different rules.  There are many major barriers that limit implementation of T ransit-Oriented Development in California The history of TOD in California is both an encouraging story and one of missed opportunities. California has recently produced a number of new TODs across the state, and bus and rail TOD have been shown to be an effective tool to help shape growth and provide mobility alternatives. Yet, while interest in TOD is significant, the reality in California is that TOD is the exception and not the rule at most major transit stations. The dominant land use around the majority of the California's significant bus and rail stops is lowdensity automobile-oriented development that does not take advantage of proximity to high-quality transit service and does not provide optimal access to transit stations.  Parsons Brinckerhoff  Bay Area Rapid Transit Pleasant Hill Station, CA BART has a complex history with TOD. The original premise was that development at stations would naturally occur so no concerted TOD effort was undertaken. BART now has an extensive joint development and station area planning program in concert with local jurisdictions at many of its stations.  Funding for TODs Whether real or perceived, many developers believe there are significant barriers to overcome in trying to secure funding for TODs. These barriers include: the belief that mixed-use developments are risky, difficulty in appraising TODs using traditional appraisal methods, and a perceived unwillingness of investors to fund developments in central cities. Three things are required for TOD projects to overcome a financiers' hesitation and to increase their chances to obtain financing:  What is happening with T OD in California?  There is more activity with TOD planning and implementation in California now than at any time during the last century. At every major transit agency that was surveyed for this study, there are at least one or more Well-planned phasing. Some componew TOD projects currently underway at its nent of the overall development needs to bus and/or rail stations. For some transit start generating cash flow early while systems, these are the first TODs the the remaining phases of the TOD are transit agency has been directly involved completed. with, even after more than a decade of providing rail service.  What are the Major Barriers to Implementing TOD in California? Although the community and transportation benefits of TOD can be significant, there are still many major barriers that limit the broader implementation of TOD in California.  8 California Department of Transportation   Based on this study's review of TOD, it is possible to summarize the major barriers into the following broad areas: Transit system design. The design of transit systems can be a major barrier to successful TOD. Stations often have poor pedestrian access, and broad expanses of surface-level parking lots often separate the stations from the surrounding community. Stations and transit corridors are often located in areas with little to no development potential, reducing transit's ability to link activity centers. Local community concerns. To local neighborhoods, proposals for TOD projects often are met with concerns about changing the character of a community. Even with quality design and appropriate density, and despite local government support for a TOD, community concerns about density and traffic are often huge hurdles to implementation. Local zoning not transit-friendly. In many major transit station areas in the state, local zoning has not been changed to reflect the presence of transit. Local development codes around stations often tend to favor low density, auto-oriented uses. Creating and implementing transitfriendly zoning becomes an additional challenge. Moffett Park, Sunnyvale, CA The City of Sunnyvale's Transportation Demand Management (TDM) ordinance helped create an ""unintentional TOD"" at Moffett Park leveraged by the developer's ability to build a bigger building with a TOD design. A $2.5 million privately financed light rail station serves the project.  Higher developer risk & cost. Mixeduse, higher density projects with reduced amounts of parking (such as in TOD) can significantly increase risks for developers and financiers. TOD can be more costly, and subject to added regulations and more complex local approval processes, as compared to conventional ""auto-oriented"" development. Financing difficult to obtain. Obtaining private financing for TODs is often also a barrier. Lenders typically have concerns about financing mixed-use projects or those with lower parking ratios (which are typical in TOD). Public financing available for implementing TOD is very limited and often difficult to obtain in California. Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  9  Jay Paul Company  Jay Paul Company   Parking Reductions for TOD TOD offers significant opportunities to reduce the number of parking spaces below conventional parking requirements typical for retail, office and residential land uses. TOD provides these opportunities by increasing transit accessibility and combining a mixture of land uses. The design and location of TODs enables a reduction in the number of parking spaces needed. The resulting cost savings can be significant. Reduced parking requirements can lower TOD construction costs, which in turn helps make housing more affordable and/or allows more development to be built on sites near transit. For example, in one case study of six San Francisco neighborhoods, reducing the standard requirement for off-street parking was found to decrease costs for condominiums by more than ten percent. Research indicates TOD offers the potential to reduce parking per household on the order of approximately 20%, as compared to non transit-oriented land uses. A wide range of parking reductions has also been found for commercial parking in TODs. However, to date, there are no clear conclusions regarding how much parking may reasonably be reduced for any particular TOD. Therefore, parking need calculations must be made on a site-by-site basis.  How can the state of California facilitate T OD implement ation? Recommendations regarding potential statelevel strategies to encourage broader implementation of TOD emerged from an extensive process that lasted over a year. Based on the results of this process, the Policy Steering Committee to the Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study recommended fourteen promising state-level strategies to assist in overcoming TOD implementation barriers. These strategies can be grouped into two broad areas, as follows: Strategy Area #1: State Policies and Practices Strategies in this category include: Encouraging improved coordination of land use and transportation planning at local and regional levels. Facilitating the use and sale of state-owned land near major transit stations for TOD. Examining state environmental review requirements in relation to TOD to determine whether changes may be indicated to reduce barriers. Contributing to improved data on travel and economic impacts of TOD, and incorporating data into improved analysis and decision-making tools; and Providing information and technical assistance on TOD implementation.  T ransit-Oriented Development has the potential to reduce parking per household by approximately 20% The state can encourage local agencies to more closely link land use practices that promote a transit-friendly urban form by providing information, funding for planning, and by fostering cooperation. TOD proponents often face significant delays and difficulties when trying to secure local land use approvals for projects, even in areas where regional and local policies are supportive of this type of development. In addition, the state can provide direct assistance for TOD implementation by reducing existing barriers to leasing or purchasing state-owned ""excess"" and/or underutilized land located near major transit stations. There is also an important role for the state in developing and disseminating data and information about the effects and benefits of TOD regarding travel, economic, and social benefits and impacts. This information is necessary in order to improve the accuracy of analysis prepared for proposed TOD projects and also could help expedite local land use approval processes.  10 California Department of Transportation   Strategy Area #2: State Funding for Planning and Implementation This study recommends that the state of California could help overcome barriers to implementing TOD by: Providing funding to local jurisdictions to prepare plans and adopt ordinances that facilitate transit-oriented development. Providing financial incentives to enable local agencies and private organizations to implement TOD. Offering funding for specific types of TOD demonstration projects. Changing existing law to allow local agencies to provide `tax-increment financing' around major transit stations, even if they are located outside redevelopment areas. Allowing greater flexibility in the use of state transportation funds for TOD; and Helping to make private TOD mortgage instruments (such as the ""Location Efficient Mortgage"" (LEM) program more widely available. The Transit Villages Act of 1994 is acknowledged by many as the most important step in California, at the state level, regarding TOD. This act provides for cities and counties to prepare plans for `transit village' districts near major existing or planned transit stations. It stipulates that transit villages should contain a mixture of land uses, and it establishes that transit village plans are eligible for transportation funding.  However, although this legislation is an important step, it provides no funding for implementing TOD, which has been a major barrier to its wider implementation in California. Research conducted for this study indicates that there is an overall strong real estate market outlook in California for TOD, and favorable demographic trends in the major metropolitan areas of the state. However, even so, TOD project proponents widely report that they often encounter significant difficulty obtaining private financing to implement TOD projects. Public funding for TOD implementation in California is very scarce, outside established local redevelopment areas. The mixed-use aspect of many TOD projects tends to complicate the process of obtaining development financing, and the high cost of building parking structures can add significantly to project costs. Obtaining financing for affordable housing within TODs can be extremely complex because these projects typically require multiple funding sources with widely varying requirements. To complicate the situation, local jurisdictions often lack the necessary funding to be able to prepare TOD plans or development ordinances. In addition, local agencies typically lack the ability to provide effective financial incentives or assistance to encourage the development of quality TODs, unless a project is located within an established redevelopment area where taxincrement financing may be available.  TOD Profile: Uptown District, San Diego The Uptown district is a 14-acre mixed-use bus TOD put together under the leadership of the City of San Diego. For this project, San Diego wanted to showcase a mixeduse development. There was no public opposition to the project since it required relatively little change to the community (the site was a former Sears store in an existing mixed-use community). The residential component has 320 units at an average density of 43 units per net acre; the 145,000 square feet of retail and commercial space includes a 42,500 square foot supermarket. The Uptown project was financed by the redevelopment agency and has been successful in creating a community where it is convenient to walk to shopping and where transit service is excellent. The project is parked conventionally; no special parking reductions were implemented to account for the presence of transit. The parking ratio for commercial is 1 space per 285 square feet and 2.25 spaces per unit for the residential. Residential and supermarket parking is underground, and street level spaces are available for retail shoppers.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  11   T OD in America A TOD renaissance is underway across America. More so than at anytime in recent history there is heightened interest in planning for and implementing TOD. The forces driving America's TOD renaissance include: escalating traffic congestion increasing the attractiveness of sites close to rail; an increased trend of Americans moving back into America's cities; demographic changes underpinning an expanding market for higher density mixed-use communities; increased support for smart growth and the strategies necessary to implement it; changes in Federal Transit Administration policies for transit `joint development' and an emphasis on transitsupportive land uses in funding recommendations for new rail starts; and finally, more transit agencies are starting to realize they are in both the community-building and the people-moving businesses.  One of the lessons for succeeding with TOD is the need to start TOD planning very early in the project development process. Decisions on alignment, where to put stations and the layout of transit facilities all can make a huge difference between a successful or unsuccessful TOD strategy.  Detailed descriptions of these strategies are provided in chapter 9 of the report, ""Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study: Factors for Success in California"".

Solving problems early-on means bringing an expanded `cast of characters' to the table. To enhance coordination, engineers and transit planners designing transit systems need to work closely with land use planners, real estate economists, architects, landowners, and residents. In addition, land-use planners should coordinate with transit agencies in planning and locating transit-supportive development.
