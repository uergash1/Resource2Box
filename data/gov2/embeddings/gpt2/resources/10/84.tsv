Messenger  is an  advertisement -supported  instant messaging   client  and  associated protocol  provided by  Yahoo! . Yahoo! Messenger is provided free of charge and can be downloaded and used with a generic ""Yahoo! ID"" which also allows access to other Yahoo! services, such as  Yahoo! Mail , where users can be automatically notified when they receive new email. Yahoo! also offers PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service, file transfers, webcam hosting, text messaging service, and chat rooms in various categories.   Yahoo! Messenger was originally launched under the name Yahoo! Pager on  1998 - 03-09 . [ 1 ]   In addition to instant messaging features similar to those offered by  ICQ , it also offers (on  Microsoft Windows ) features such as:  IMVironments  (customizing the look of Instant Message windows, some of which include authorized themes of famous cartoons such as  Garfield  or  Dilbert ), address-book integration and Custom Status Messages. [ 2 ]  It was also the first major IM client to feature BUZZing and music-status. Another recently added feature is customized  avatars .

Messenger announced the release of Yahoo Messenger for Windows Vista as a Beta Release. It includes transparent Glass Windows and a new skin and GUI for the Windows Sidebar and program. Also integrated new tabs for going between different chat windows. As of October 25, 2008,  Yahoo! Messenger for Vista version is no longer available.   On October 29, 2007, Yahoo! Messenger announced the release of Yahoo! Messenger 9 Beta. It features a new and improved interface, new emoticons (also hidden emotions [ 3 ] ), the integration with Flickr account and a new in-line media player which enables the user to view maps, photos and videos from sites like Yahoo! Video and YouTube right in the IM window. [ 4 ]   Yahoo! has announced a partnership with  Microsoft  to join their instant messaging networks. This would make Yahoo! Messenger compatible with Microsoft's  .NET Messenger Service . It also made Microsoft's  Windows Live Messenger  compatible with Yahoo!'s Network. This change has taken effect as of  2006 - 07-13  - Yahoo! Messenger has integrated instant messaging with  Windows Live Messenger  users, and is fully functional.   British Telecommunications' BT Communicator software is based on Yahoo! Messenger. BT Communicator was withdrawn on  2006 - 12-31 . [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Features     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Voice       Main article:  Yahoo! Voice       Yahoo! Voice  is a  Voice over IP  PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service  [ 6 ] ,  [ 7 ]  provided by  Yahoo!  via its Yahoo! Messenger  instant messaging  application. It is also available for the Mac OS X platform  [ 8 ] .     [ edit ]   Voicemail and file sharing   Yahoo! added voicemail and file sending capabilities to their client. File-sharing of sizes up to 2GB was added to Yahoo meseneger     [ edit ]   Plug-ins   As of 8.0, Yahoo! Messenger has added the ability for users to create plug-ins (via the use of the freely available  Yahoo! Messenger Plug-in SDK ), which are then hosted and showcased on the  Yahoo! Plug-in gallery .     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Mail integration   Yahoo! plans to integrate  Yahoo! Mail Beta  and Yahoo! Messenger. [ 9 ]  Conversations will be archived and stored in the same manner as emails. This allows users to search within their chat logs easily, and to have them centrally stored and accessible from any computer.     [ edit ]   Chat   All versions of Yahoo! Messenger have included the ability to access Yahoo! Chat rooms.   On June 19, 2005, with no advance warning, Yahoo! disabled users' ability to create their own chat rooms. The move came after  KPRC-TV  in  Houston, Texas  reported that many of the user-created rooms were geared toward  pedophilia . Many regulars in these rooms used the rooms to set up meetings to have sex with children and trade lewd pictures. While it was thought this move came as a result of several advertisers pulling their ads from Yahoo!, a more likely cause was a $10 million lawsuit filed by watchdog groups of internet portals on behalf of a 12-year-old victim of molestation [ 10 ]  .   Yahoo! has since closed down the chat.yahoo.com site (which is now a redirect to a section of the Yahoo! Messenger page) because the great majority of chat users accessed it through Messenger. In August 2007, it began requiring  word verification  in order to use Yahoo! Chat. Officially, this is to guard against spammers and automated bots, which had been a source of frustration for many chatters (This method has proved highly unsuccessful, as many rooms now have more bots than users). However, as this also logs users' IP addresses, this feature could presumably be used to monitor against the type of behavior that prevailed in the pedophilia-oriented rooms. The company claims to be still working on a way to allow users to create their own rooms while providing safeguards against abuse.   As of November 2008, Yahoo's inability to control chat bots and spammers continues to be a major issue. Over 90% of all chat messages, even in supposedly family oriented chat rooms like genealogy, appear to be originated by automated spam bots spewing solicitations for adult activities, web cams and pictures.   On October 16th, 2008, the Yahoo! Profiles community rolled out a new beta profile network with no prior announcement. According to customer feedback, the new profiles now resemble a stripped-down version of MASH.   This unexpected move resulted in hundreds of thousands of existing profiles being cleared of all information.     [ edit ]   Web Messenger   Similar to  MSN Web Messenger  and  AOL Instant Messenger 's  Aim Express and Quick Buddy , Yahoo! Messenger also has a web applet version that runs in a browser window to communicate with friends. Recently, it has switched from  DHTML  to  Adobe Flash  in coding.     [ edit ]   URI scheme   Yahoo! Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra  URI scheme  (""protocol"") handler into some web browsers, so that URIs beginning "" ymsgr: "" can open a new Yahoo! Messenger window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the  mailto:  URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the YIM user  notarealuser :   <a href="" ymsgr:sendim?notarealuser "">Send Message</a>     To specify a message body, the  m  parameter is used, so that the link location might look like this:   ymsgr:sendim?notarealuser&m=This+is+my+message     * ymsgr:sendim? Example: ymsgr:sendim?myid      * ymsgr:addfriend? Example: ymsgr:addfriend?myid    * ymsgr:sendfile? Example: ymsgr:sendfile?myid    * ymsgr:call? Example: ymsgr:call?1-800-555-7654     * ymsgr:callPhone? Example: ymsgr:callPhone?1-800-555-7654    * YMSGR:chat? ""opens chat room list""    * ymsgr:im? Opens ""send an im window""    * ymsgr:getimv?doodle    * ymsgr:getimv?yfighter       [ edit ]   Offline messaging   Offline messaging, a feature long offered by  Yahoo! , allows online users to send messages to their contacts, even if said contacts are not signed in at the time. The sender's offline contacts will receive these messages when they next go online.     [ edit ]   Interoperability   On October 13, 2005, Yahoo! and Microsoft announced plans to introduce interoperability between their two messengers, creating the second largest real time communications service userbase worldwide: 40 percent of all users ( AIM  currently holds 56 percent). The announcement comes after years of 3rd party interoperability success (most notably,  Trillian ,  Pidgin ) and criticisms that the major real time communications services were locking their networks. Microsoft has also had talks with AOL in an attempt to introduce further interoperability, but so far, AOL seems unwilling to participate.   Interoperability between Yahoo! and Windows Live Messenger was launched July 12, 2006. This allows, for Yahoo! and Windows Live Messenger users to chat to each other without the need to create an account on the other service, provided both contacts use the latest versions of the clients. For now, it's impossible to talk using the voice service among both messengers.     [ edit ]   Games   There are various games and applications available that can be accessed via the conversation window by clicking the games icon and challenging your current contact. It requires  Java  to work.     [ edit ]   Main process   The Windows version of Yahoo! Messenger previously used ypager.exe as the name of the instance of the client. It was changed to yahoomessenger.exe since the  beta  of version 7.5.0.     [ edit ]   Malware   Yahoo! Messenger (along with other networks such as Windows Live Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger) is often used as a conduit or ""vector"" for delivering malicious software such as spyware, viruses, worms, and trojans to unsuspecting computer users. The three methods used by hackers to deliver malware over the IM vector are (1) sending a file transfer with a virus-infected file, (2) delivering a message with socially engineered content containing a web address (URL) containing active malicious code and (3) sending specially crafted messages exploiting security vulnerabilities in the client software. Viruses and worms with colorful names such as W32.Yalove or W32/Spybot-MQ have been identified as targeting users of the Yahoo! Messenger network over the past few years.   The most common method of delivering a malicious payload is the use of social engineering to construct a message that appears to be coming from a contact on the recipient's contact list. A socially engineered message is one that is written in a friendly, informal manner, that could easily be mistaken as coming from a friend. The message usually will say something like ""Click here to see pics of me from vacation!"" or ""Is this you?"" with a web address -- known as a ""poison URL"" -- for the recipient to click. Upon clicking the web address, the recipient is connected to a website containing active content, which is immediately downloaded to the recipient's computer. In most cases, the payload contains an installer, a number of hidden files containing text, and code which causes the same socially engineered message with poison URL to be sent to every contact on the contact list. When the message is sent to all contacts, the cycle starts again, as each contact believes they are receiving a message from a trusted friend. In this manner, IM-borne malware is capable of propagating very rapidly through company and external networks.   Worms and viruses are discovered on a regular basis by security companies, particularly by the three companies with  IM-specific security products , Akonix Systems, FaceTime Communications, and Symantec. According to IM security researchers at Akonix, the number of new threats identified each month is 30 to 35, with a high of 88 in October, 2006.     [ edit ]   SPIM   Yahoo! Messenger users are subject to unsolicited messages ( SPIM ) and the problem remains unresolved. Blogs and websites addressing this issue are supportive of the chat environment, and writers genuinely want to continue using the service, yet express frustration about Yahoo's apparent failure to address spam and other related problems. User queries are met with  forms  and replies that Yahoo is ""working to resolve the problem,"" yet there is no evident progress. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  As of 2007 it is estimated that at least 60% of all users who use Yahoo chat rooms are bots. [ 13 ]  Yahoo has introduced a  CAPTCHA  system to help filter out bots from joining chat rooms but it has done little to actually stop the problem and has only inconvenienced human users.     [ edit ]   Canceled releases   Yahoo! recently released a preview version of Yahoo! Messenger: Yahoo! Messenger for Windows Vista. It has been designed to exploit the new design elements of Vista's  Windows Presentation Foundation  and entitles a whole new user interface and features. Currently it lacks some basic functions such as webcam support and Chat. It has been discontinued.     [ edit ]   Upcoming releases   The Mac OS X client version 3.0 Beta 3 has been released: file transfers have been re-enabled as have group conferences.

clueweb09-en0009-39-14672	      The Hacker's Diet   How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition    By  John Walker           The Hacker's Diet , notwithstanding its silly subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It treats dieting and weight control from an  engineering  and  management  standpoint, and provides the tools and an understanding of why they work and how to use them that permit the reader to gain control of their own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy, successful engineers, programmers, and managers who have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose weight and avoid re-gaining it.  Computer-based tools  and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing Platform are available, as well as an online Web application, but a computer is not necessary to use the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil alternatives are provided.     Fourth Edition (2005)       The Fourth Edition of  The Hacker's Diet  was released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance. The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the  XHTMLÂ 1.0  (Transitional and Frameset) and  CSSÂ 2.1  standards and requires a browser which implements these standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities. JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.       Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)     If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with frames remains available. It allows navigation with a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a footnote icon, like this one:   will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window. Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in the main document window by clicking the footnote icon, then use their browser's âBackâ button to return to the main text.     No-Frame Web Edition       Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those who prefer a more linear presentation in a single window, may access a no-frame edition of  The Hacker's Diet  with identical content to the frame-based book. The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click on the footnote icon to display it, then use the âBackâ button or keystroke to return to the text containing the footnote.       Computer-Based Tools     Computer-based tools and experiments for Microsoft Excel and the Palm Computing Platform are available for downloading. A Web-based application, The Hacker's Diet  Online , which can be used from any computer with Internet access and a Web browser, is available.       The Hacker's Diet  Online       This Web-based application allows you to maintain weight      and exercise logs, produce custom charts, analyse trends,  and plan diets from any computer with Internet connectivity and  a Web browser.  Data may be imported from and exported to  other versions of the computer tools, or exported as CSV or XML for  analysis with other programs.          Microsoft Excel       Versions compatible with         a variety of Excel releases are available, all ZIPped         archives of about 250 Kb.          Palm Computing Platform       An implementation of the Eat Watch Â®  nutrition and exercise         log and analysis software for the Palm Computing Platform         (PalmPilot, Palm, PalmOS, etc.), including desktop         software for any platform with a standard C language         environment which generates illustrated HTML logs         from databases backed up from the handheld.      Acrobat PDF Edition       If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can  download a PDF edition  (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed) which you can read with the Adobe Acrobat Reader utility, available for most personal computers and Unix workstations, which may be  downloaded free of charge  directly from the  Adobe Systems  Web site. The Acrobat PDF edition preserves all the formatting of the original book, much of which was lost in creating the Web editions, and permits point-and-click navigation among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.      Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you a nice button for downloading your own copy of Acrobat Reader, but they won't let me use the image without âregisteringâ and âlicensingâ it, which I'm certainly not going to do in order to promote their product and its file format.       PostScript Edition      The Hacker's Diet  was originally typeset using  TeX  with the  LaTeX  macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated from PostScript created by the  dvips  utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line with a PostScript viewing program such as  GhostScript  (which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible printer.   Before sending this file to a printer, consider that the book is almost 250 pages long!   This is a  big  print job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and, potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be downloaded as either a  ZIPped archive  or a  gzip  compressed Unix  tar  file ; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7 Mb PostScript file.                           by  John Walker

VERY Cool Indeed   ~~ Linda F.          Johnson , Linda's Computer Stop          Do you get frustrated because every program has different keyboard    shortcuts and you can never remember them all?      Are there programs or websites that you use a lot and you would like    one button keyboard shortcuts that take you there instantly?      Are you using cardboard or plastic overlays on your keyboard that    show you which key does what in a particular program and those overlays    keep sliding all over the place?        Well, if your answer to ANY of these questions is ""yes"" have I found a   treat for YOU!!    Â     Canadians, here's one for you too!! Â  Excel Promotion Canada Webstore    About a month ago, a very nice man named Oren Kramer sent me an email and   asked if I would like to try out his Excel Keyboard.Â  Well, I had   actually been looking at my beatup keyboard with the faded keys and was   thinking it was time to replace it, so I figured ""why not?""Â  So, Oren   sent me this REALLY cool keyboard.Â  It is basically a plain black base   which has changeable keyboards that easily snap into place on top of it.Â    Oren sent me the base and the Excel snap-on, but there are many more for   different programs and games.Â  If you have the Flash viewer installed on your computer,   click below to see a little   movie that shows how they snap on:                         Besides Excel, there are keyboard snap-ons for programs like Word,   Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Flash, as well as keyboards for many popular   games like Age of Mythology and Neverwinter Nights, and even a Crossfire   keyboard that works with just about any action/shooting game.       See   my review of the Word Keyset HERE.     When you buy   the base, it comes with the Windows/Internet Explorer snap-on, so you can   use it as-is, or order snap-ons for the particular programs you use most.Â    I've found that I can use the Excel snap-on even when I'm not in Excel.Â    As a matter of fact, I'm using it to type this article right now.Â  When   using the snap-on within the program it was made for, every key on the   keyboard is clearly labelled to tell you what it does.Â  When Excel is   not the active window, the keyboard just works like a regular keyboard.     Along with all the   special keys built into the snap-ons that are linked to keyboard shortcuts   within that program, you can use the options to customize all the F keys   across the top of your keyboard, and there are pre-programmed multimedia   keys for easy access to Windows media player ... and 10 special keys on the   base keyboard that you can   program to open any file, folder, program, or web page of your choice.Â    I can turn on my computer and have Outlook, my website inside FrontPage,   media player playing my favorite music, and my internet home page opened in   about five seconds. And, I am so sick of having to replace my keyboard   every time one or two keys go bad.Â  Now, if that should happen, I won't   EVER have to replace my keyboard ... I can simply get a new snap-on, if   needed.Â  And the snap-on is so easy to clean...just remove it from the   base and shake all the dirt out of it. I love my new Excel Keyboard.Â  And, I'm patiently waiting for   my new Crossfire keyboard, which I purchased, since I can never remember which keys I have to   use to shoot, duck, jump, etc. when I'm playing action games, and therefore,   I always die  :-( Want more   info?Â  Go to theÂ  Ideazon Web Store    and see what they have to offer.

clueweb09-enwp01-33-18389	"                     Microsoft Natural keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Microsoft Natural Keyboard  is a  computer keyboard  that was introduced by  Microsoft  in 1994. The  keyboard  was a split keyboard with each half of the keyboard separated and tilted upwards and down from the center of the keyboard. This key arrangement was  ergonomically  designed to prevent  carpal tunnel syndrome  and other  repetitive strain injuries  associated with typing for long periods of time. The keyboard also helps to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer.   Although it was not the first ergonomic keyboard, it was the first that was widely available and reasonably priced. This keyboard has gained wide popularity.          Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, circa Q4 1999.       Microsoft introduced the  Natural Keyboard Elite  in 1998 and the  Natural Keyboard Pro  in 1999 as upgraded replacements for the original Natural Keyboard. The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the key block normally found above the cursor keys. Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys' inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below. It is said [ who? ]  that this change makes the arrow keys hard to use.   The Natural Keyboard Pro retained the original inverted-T layout of the cursor keys, and gained a row of program shortcut keys along the top edge of the board. These keys can be customized to the users preference by using the Intellitype software from Microsoft (Intellitype software is required to alter the operation of the shortcut keys, this keyboard has been dropped from the supported list in later versions and so cannot be used in Vista 64, however, selecting ""internet keyboard"" from the drop down list allows the functions to be edited as before and so allows full functionality in Vista 64).   Another significant change were the feet of the keyboard. While the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard has feet in the front, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back.   In 2004, Microsoft introduced the  Wireless Natural MultiMedia Keyboard , which introduced a row of customizable buttons above the function keys for launching applications or controlling play of music. A common criticism of this keyboard is the F Lock key located right beside F12, which toggles the functions keys from sending normal signals or common task signals such as Undo Redo, Open etc. The primary problem is that the default state of the F Lock is ""enabled"" meaning that the keyboard normally overrides the standard F-functions and instead attempts to perform the ""enhanced"" functions theoretically enabled by the software (which of course assumes, often incorrectly, that the user desires these enhanced functions and/or has installed the optional software.) It is not possible to disable this toggle either through the bundled software or by choosing not to install the software. Without the software installed, the F keys will do nothing, and toggling them back to normal by using the F Lock has been found by some to be unreliable as the keyboard will often randomly and inexplicably ""untoggle"" the F Lock key. See  here  for a method to disable the F-lock feature. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with ins keys removed and del key expanded.     [ edit ]   Natural Ergonomic Keyboard   In September 2005, Microsoft introduced the  Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 . This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, an integrated leatherette wrist rest and a ""hump"" in the middle of the keyboard that ensures that the wrist angle is correct. It also ships with a removable front stand that allows the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys without any bending of the wrist. Additionally, the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 23 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to ""on"", providing the original function key features rather than the new ""enhanced"" functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on. With this model, there is less of the distinctive ""click clack"" noise that is common with older keyboards that have mechanical switches. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Unlike its predecessor the Natural Pro, the 4000 does not include USB ports for additional devices such as a mouse.   With most Microsoft keyboards, software (Microsoft  IntelliType ) is bundled for both Mac OS X and Windows, allowing users to customize the function keys and modifier keys fairly extensively.   The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard claimed life of one million  actuations  for each QWERTY key. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^   ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Review"" .

clueweb09-enwp02-28-08555	"                     Microsoft Natural keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  Natural keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Microsoft Natural Keyboard  is a  computer keyboard  that was introduced by  Microsoft  in 1994. The  keyboard  was a split keyboard with each half of the keyboard separated and tilted upwards and down from the center of the keyboard. This key arrangement was  ergonomically  designed to prevent  carpal tunnel syndrome  and other  repetitive strain injuries  associated with typing for long periods of time. The keyboard also helps to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer.   Although it was not the first ergonomic keyboard, it was the first that was widely available and reasonably priced. This keyboard has gained wide popularity.          Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, circa Q4 1999.       Microsoft introduced the  Natural Keyboard Elite  in 1998 and the  Natural Keyboard Pro  in 1999 as upgraded replacements for the original Natural Keyboard. The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the key block normally found above the cursor keys. Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys' inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below. It is said [ who? ]  that this change makes the arrow keys hard to use.   The Natural Keyboard Pro retained the original inverted-T layout of the cursor keys, and gained a row of program shortcut keys along the top edge of the board. These keys can be customized to the users preference by using the Intellitype software from Microsoft (Intellitype software is required to alter the operation of the shortcut keys, this keyboard has been dropped from the supported list in later versions and so cannot be used in Vista 64, however, selecting ""internet keyboard"" from the drop down list allows the functions to be edited as before and so allows full functionality in Vista 64).   Another significant change were the feet of the keyboard. While the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard has feet in the front, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back.   In 2004, Microsoft introduced the  Wireless Natural MultiMedia Keyboard , which introduced a row of customizable buttons above the function keys for launching applications or controlling play of music. A common criticism of this keyboard is the F Lock key located right beside F12, which toggles the functions keys from sending normal signals or common task signals such as Undo Redo, Open etc. The primary problem is that the default state of the F Lock is ""enabled"" meaning that the keyboard normally overrides the standard F-functions and instead attempts to perform the ""enhanced"" functions theoretically enabled by the software (which of course assumes, often incorrectly, that the user desires these enhanced functions and/or has installed the optional software.) It is not possible to disable this toggle either through the bundled software or by choosing not to install the software. Without the software installed, the F keys will do nothing, and toggling them back to normal by using the F Lock has been found by some to be unreliable as the keyboard will often randomly and inexplicably ""untoggle"" the F Lock key. See  here  for a method to disable the F-lock feature. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with ins keys removed and del key expanded.     [ edit ]   Natural Ergonomic Keyboard   In September 2005, Microsoft introduced the  Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 . This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, an integrated leatherette wrist rest and a ""hump"" in the middle of the keyboard that ensures that the wrist angle is correct. It also ships with a removable front stand that allows the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys without any bending of the wrist. Additionally, the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 23 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to ""on"", providing the original function key features rather than the new ""enhanced"" functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on. With this model, there is less of the distinctive ""click clack"" noise that is common with older keyboards that have mechanical switches. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Unlike its predecessor the Natural Pro, the 4000 does not include USB ports for additional devices such as a mouse.   With most Microsoft keyboards, software (Microsoft  IntelliType ) is bundled for both Mac OS X and Windows, allowing users to customize the function keys and modifier keys fairly extensively.   The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard claimed life of one million  actuations  for each QWERTY key. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^   ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Review"" .
