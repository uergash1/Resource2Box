The order follows the  Augustinian  rule.           Contents       1   History   2   The Modern Order   3   Sources   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   The order arose in the city of  Mechlin , in the  Duchy of Brabant  (in central  Flanders , now  Belgium ), in the fifteenth century, during the terrible ravages of a  pandemic  called the  ""Black Death.""  Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)       The trademarked term  purpose driven  comes from the teaching of  Rick Warren , senior pastor of  Saddleback Church  in Lake Forest, California. It originally came into use as a  paradigm  taught to pastors and other  Christian  leaders worldwide to help them be more effective in leading their churches. This teaching is embodied in Warrens best-selling book,  The Purpose Driven Church , first published in 1995. [ 1 ]   The basic premise of the Purpose Driven paradigm is for a pastor to recognize and be obedient to Gods  purposes  for his people and his  church  and organize around developing these characteristics into the lives of people within his care. In Christian terms, this is the task of  making  disciples . An additional focus is how to be most effective in reaching out to share Gods love and  forgiveness  in the local community and with non-believers who visit the church. In Christian terms, this is the task of  evangelism . To be purpose driven is to be driven by Gods purposes, not our own. [ 1 ]   These purposes, according to Warrens teaching, are found in two verses in the  New Testament  book of  Matthew . These two passages, located in Matthew chapters 22 and 28, are often referred to by Christians worldwide as the  Great Commandment  and the  Great Commission . From these verses, Warren identified five purposes: worship, ministry, mission, fellowship, and discipleship. [ 1 ]         Love the Lord your God with all your heart  and with all your soul and with all your mind... Love your neighbor as yourself . All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.  Matthew 22:3740 (NIV)   Worship   Love the Lord your God with all your heart       Ministry   Love your neighbor as yourself                Go and make disciples  of all nations,  baptizing them  in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and  teaching them to obey  everything I have commanded you.  Matthew 28:1920 (NIV)   Mission   Go and make disciples       Fellowship   baptizing them       Discipleship   teaching them to obey        In 2002, Warren wrote  The Purpose Driven Life  as a 40-day devotional book. [ 2 ]  This has become an international best seller, with over 30 million copies in print by 2006. [ 3 ]  This book took the same five purposes and focused on the life of the individual Christian. The book starts out with the words, "" Its not about you,  meaning the life that God created us to live is one driven by his purposes, not our own desires. [ 2 ]   The tenets of the Purpose Driven paradigm have been taught to hundreds of thousands of Christian leaders worldwide through conferences and seminars, with many pastors adopting the principles in their churches. While there is no formal Purpose Driven organization  this activity being an outreach of Saddleback Church  there is an informal worldwide  network  of churches that work together to train other leaders, publish training resources in local languages, and collaborate on evangelistic and social action activities. This latter activity of evangelism and social action has developed into a strategy called The  P.E.A.C.E. Plan , in which many of these same churches also are involved.   The Purpose Driven paradigm is a set of principles and processes based on an understanding of the biblical purposes for the church. Implementing this paradigm enables the church leader to be most effective in reaching out to people in love, welcoming them into the fellowship of the local church, encouraging and training them for Christ-like behavior, and equipping them for volunteer service within the church  all as an expression of their worship to God. Simply put, the Purpose Driven paradigm encourages the Christian leader to maintain an intentional,  strategic , and balanced focus on all five purposes, which will in turn produce church health. The concept focuses on health, with the conviction that growth will take care of itself when a congregation is healthy. The paradigm is being utilized by churches in many denominations and theological expressions across many cultures worldwide.

It was first published in 1995. It is subtitled, "" Growth Without Compromising Your Message & Mission ."" In a May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by  George Barna ,  [ 1 ]   The Purpose Driven Church  was voted as the second book most influential on their lives and ministries, behind  The Purpose Driven Life , a subsequent book by Rick Warren.   The book is targeted to pastors and church leaders and advises them to base their ministry on God's purposes, not their own ideas of ministry, hence the term "" Purpose Driven "". Warren suggests that these purposes are  Worship ,  Fellowship ,  Discipleship ,  Ministry  and  Mission  and that they are derived from the  Great Commandment  ( Matthew 22:37-40 ) and the  Great Commission  ( Matthew 28:19-20 ).   Warren writes that every church is driven by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities, events, seekers and even buildings can each be the controlling force in a church. But he believes that in order for a church to be healthy it must built around the five  New Testament  purposes given to the church by  Jesus . ""The issue is church health, not  church growth !"" declares Warren. ""If your church is healthy, growth will occur naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five  biblical  purposes of the church.""   He proposes that church leaders ask of themselves, ""What is our purpose?"", ""Why do we do what we do?"", ""What should we be doing?"", and ""How will you do that?"". In this book Warren provides a guide to answer these questions on how to do church. He further suggests that following the principles he outlines in the book will enable a church to grow         Warmer through fellowship   Deeper through discipleship   Stronger through worship   Broader through ministry, and   Larger through evangelism.         The author emphasizes an intentional people-building process. He says, If you will concentrate on building people, God will build the church.   The teaching of  The Purpose Driven Church  was derived from Warren's own experience in leading  Saddleback Church  from its founding in 1980 to over 10,000 in worship attendance in its first fifteen years, becoming one of the fastest growing churches in America during this time.  [ 2 ]   The  Purpose Driven Church  has been translated into over 30 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. It is listed in  100 Christian Books That Changed the Century   [ 3 ]  and has been given many awards. For example, in 1996 and 1997, the book was the  Evangelical Christian Publishers Association  (ECPA)  Christian Book Award Winner  for the US. In 2002, the ECPA awarded it the Gold Medallion Award. [ 4 ]  The book and its author has received numerous reviews in the mainstream press and has been the subject of much support and criticism in Christian blogs and newsletters. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  In 2005, Time magazine called Rick Warren ""America's pastor.""

He has been invited to speak at the United Nations, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the African Union, the Council on Foreign Relations, Harvards Kennedy School of Government, TIMEs Global Health Summit, and numerous congresses around the world. TIME magazine named him one of 15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004 and in 2005 one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Also, in 2005 U.S. News & World Report named him one of  Americas 25 Best Leaders.    As a theologian , Dr. Warren has lectured at Oxford, Cambridge, the University of Judaism, the Evangelical Theological Society, and numerous seminaries and universities.

One such person was  Sedrick , a gay man, who was struggling with his finances. Rev. Ed Bacon, an Episcopal priest and one of the spiritual advisors, addressed the young mans lack of self worth by saying that,  being gay is a gift from God , Minister Bernard Beckwith, another advisor, assured Sedrick that &he is the image and likeness of God just the as he is.   Oprah asked Sedrick if he believed being gay is a gift from God. Sedrick said that he hadnt thought that way before but that after talking with the spiritual leaders on the program, I think Im going to leave here with a renewed vision.  So Im getting it.  Unfortunately, the Oprah show website left out this important personal revelation out of the episode recap on the website.   Rev. Ed Bacon   Rev. Bacon is rector of  All Saints Episcopal Church  in Pasadena, California, where the Rev.  Susan Russell  serves as senior associate rector and is the president of Integrity, the national Episcopal LGBT advocacy group. Take a look at her  blog to read moving letters from people who saw the Oprah show . Dr. Beckwith is the founder and spiritual director of  Agape International Spiritual Center in Los Angeles  which  is an LGBT-affirming congregation .   The response was so massive that Oprah did a follow-up segment with Rev. Bacon on January 12. Oprah asked Rev. Bacon, So do people call you or were they only just calling me?       Rev. Bacon  said, Oh no my friend. My email was full of content and from what I gather, it simply unleashed a flood of healing throughout the country, and Australia, and Great Britain across the continent. It was amazing that people were talking about their hearts being healed and their hearts leaping. Two or three people said I am weeping while I am writing you this email. It was amazing and most of the email and voice maillike 30 to onewas appreciative that being gay is a gift from God.   Take  action!  Please  write to Oprah  and thank her for including LGBT-inclusive faith voices on her show. Share your story about how Rev. Bacons comments affected you, both in your email and in the comments below.            Related Posts:              Statement by GLAAD President on the Rev.

Giuliano, made a  statement  about the selection of the Rt. Reverend V. Gene Robinson to deliver the invocation at the opening celebration of the Presidential Inauguration:   President-elect Obama has made an excellent choice with the selection of Rev. Gene Robinson, and the broadcast will allow millions of people worldwide to participate in this historic event.     Rev. Robinson represents an incredible voice who has made great strides toward encouraging LGBT inclusion in faith communities. By featuring an openly gay faith leader, Obama is sending a strong message about the importance of truly inclusive faith voices that can move us away from exclusion and division and toward the common ground we share.

It was not long ago that President-elect Obama faced heavy criticism from LGBT advocacy groups and leaders for his selection of conservative evangelist  Rick Warren  to give the inaugural invocation.  GLAAD issued  a statement, and also published clips of Warrens previous media statements on LGBT issues.   Obama defended his choice as part of his commitment to diverse voices at his inauguration, and pointed to the closing prayer invitation of straight ally,  The Reverend Joseph Lowery , a United Methodist and veteran Civil Rights activist. Lowery is a signer on the Methodist statement of  People of Color for an All Inclusive Church .    Robinsons prayer at an opening inaugural event in front of the Lincoln Memorial is a powerful reminder of this countrys efforts to move toward freedom and equality for all. Change is possible.   When Bishop Robinson was interviewed by the  Seattle Post-Intelligencer   recently, he reflected on church support of his ministry and said, There is great excitement in my heart to be living in a time when the  church is starting to get it right . We can only imagine that he may have been thinking that the country is starting to get it right, too.

Rick Warren  to give the prayer of invocation at his inauguration.  Obama’s hopeful statements of support for the LGBT community made the invitation to Warren that much more shocking.  Bloggers and our collected  media clips  show that Warren has a long history of using his platform to perpetuate anti-gay stances.   Box Turtle  states:   “Rick Warren claims he’s not a homophobe because he has “many gay friends” and has “eaten dinner in gay homes.”  And yet, he still believes that his friends’ relationships are no different morally from  child rape, incest or polygamy .   As the pastor of Saddleback mega-church (the fourth-largest church in the United States) he and his wife spent millions on global HIV/AIDS ministries. Conservatives criticize him for taking such a “liberal” stance on the HIV/AIDS issue, but he  continues to equate  same-sex marriage with incest and polygamy.   On Father’s Day this year, Warren met was persuaded to meet with the gay-affirming organization Soulforce, where  he argued  that gay people had to be celibate if they want to serve the church.   Saddleback Church drew global media attention as the venue for a presidential debate on values, which Warren followed up by using his media influence to speak against marriage for same-sex marriage. He was instrumental in building support for the passage of Proposition 8, which banned marriage for gay couples.   Today, President-elect Obama  responded at a live press conference  with carefully crafted  talking points  by saying that Warren had invited him to Saddleback in spite of their differing views on many topics and now he has invited Warren to be part of America’s “noisy conversation” of divergent opinions.  Obama pointed to the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery as the minister who will give the benediction and has  vastly different  view on gay issues.   Recently, Warren  said in an interview  over at Beliefnet that he believes in full equality:   Beliefnet: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships?   Warren: I don’t know if I’d use the term there but I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don’t believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles so I fully support equal rights.   Beliefnet: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation?   Warren: You know, not a problem with me.   GLAAD has already urged  the media ask incisive questions about what equality means in relation to employment, housing and protection from hate crimes.  We challenge them to hold both Rick Warren and President-Elect Obama accountable and clarify what  “equality” truly means to them.

LA Times reports on Warrens Christmas Eve sermon     Brad Greenberg  | December 31, 2008    So its come to this for the Rev. Rick Warren, and the once exceptional  Los Angeles Times : Southern Californias waning news leader, which today  devoted two inches to the butchering  of 189 Congo villagers, assigned not one but two reporters to find out what Warren was going to preach about on Christmas Eve. It  wasnt that interesting :            Warren told the 3,100 people who packed the churchs cavernous worship center about some plans that had not turned out as anticipated. President-elect Obamas plans for a noncontroversial inaugurationright out the door, he said, drawing a round of applause from the congregation.        The prominent minister also delivered a sobering message for Christmas.        You may be going through a change in plans right now, he said. You hadnt expected to be laid off or to be financially tight right now. And when that happens, youre asking, Why me, why now?        Jesus said you dont understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later. Thats the . . . thing you have to learn when God changes your plan. You have to learn to trust him.       The article goes on to mention what Warren said the previous weekend at the annual conference of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which I  reported on last Tuesday .    I know the pastorthe author of The Purpose-Driven Life and a rising voice in politics, evangelical and beyondgenerated controversy when President-elect Barack Obama asked him to say the prayer at the Jan. 20 inauguration, and I know that the media is still suffering from its  Jeremiah Wright hangover  and the  absence  of  Sarah Palin , but Warren isnt Wright and Obamas selection  really wasnt as surprising  as some want to portray it.

Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 31, 2008   |  Comments (0)        Franklin Graham: Obama/Warren Criticisms Ludicrous      | December 23, 2008    Evangelist Franklin Graham knows a thing or two about getting flack for praying at an inauguration. He took heat after praying in Jesus's name at President Bush's inauguration in 2001. I just  spoke with Franklin Graham , who gave his take on Obama's decision to ask megachurch pastor Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. We have also compiled our coverage of Warren over the years in a  special section .    Here are some highlights from the interview:       [Obama] is including evangelicals at his inauguration, but I don't know if he'll include them in his administration. Time will tell. But Rick Warren will have Obama's ear on important issues.        Does Warren's acceptance of the invitation give an implicit nod to Obama's administration?       For anybody to be upset at Rick Warren for offering a prayer to almighty God, asking God to give wisdom and guidance to the Obama administration, is ludicrous.        Should Rick Warren pray in the name of Jesus at the inaugural?       I would hope he does because he's a minister of the gospel. There's no other way to pray. A Muslim should not be offended. [Warren] has no other way to pray than in the name of Christ. No one should be offended, because Rick Warren should be who Rick Warren is, and that's a minister of Jesus Christ.        I know you  said a month ago  that your father would not be serving as a spiritual adviser to Barack Obama.       He's 90 years old. He's just happy to get up in the morning.        Do you have any advice for Rick Warren?       My advice to Rick is to stay true to your convictions, and don't back up one step. I don't think he will. When you have the far left and the gay advocates mad at you, you must be doing something right.          Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 23, 2008   |  Comments (18)        Pastor to the President     Mark Silk  | December 22, 2008    Once upon a time, presidents tended to choose their own pastors, or reasonable facsimiles thereof, to give the invocation at their inaugurations. The idea was: Here's the guy who presides over my religious life, the guy I go to for spiritual counsel, and so I'm going to honor him by letting him say the prayer over this latest ceremonial occasion of my life. Thus, John F. Kennedy gave the nod to Boston's Cardinal Richard Cushing in 1961 and, in 1981, Ronald Reagan tapped Bel Air Presbyterian pastor Donn Moomaw. From time to time, the invoking cleric would be chosen for symbolic reasons, as when Dwight Eisenhower selected Orthodox Archbishop Michael in 1957 and Reagan, in 1985, chose the president of Georgetown University, Father Joseph A. O'Hare S.J.    But over the past two decades, it appears that a new office has emerged--that of Pastor to the President. This emergence is a bit obscured by the fact that the only actual holder of that office has been Billy Graham. Graham gave the invocations at the inauguration of George H.W. Bush and both Clinton inaugurals, and was slated to do the same at George W. Bush's 2001 affair, but because of illness had to cede the job to his son Franklin. It is, I think, in this context that Barack Obama's choice of Rick Warren needs to be seen. As has been widely noted, Warren bids fair to become the closest thing to Billy Graham that the country has today. At the moment, he's way more controversial than the now sainted Graham, but in his younger days, Billy was plenty controversial himself.    What's important to recognize is that the position of presidential pastor is not entirely bogus. It entails spiritual counseling, advice and friendship, pastoral care. Graham actually seems to have filled that role for Richard Nixon, which helps explain why Nixon tapped him for his first inaugural invocation. The Clintons are both attached to him; according to Burns Strider, who handled faith outreach for the Hillary Clinton campaign, whenever Hillary was slated to make an appearance in North Carolina, she insisted on paying a call on the old man. And of course, George W. Bush has made central to his faith journey that walk on the beach with Billy. Even if that particular event is, strictly speaking, apocryphal, the personal connection seems real.    Rick Warren is of course the head of the Saddleback world, the crusader for AIDS, the best-selling author of popular religious books. But he also, from what I gather, has taken it upon himself to serve as spiritual counselor to the politically prominent. There is every indication that Obama has availed himself of his services. Amidst all the huffing and puffing about Warren's choice to give next month's invocation, hardly raised at all is the possibility that this was, for Obama, as much a personal as a political decision. His family is, famously, between churches, and his relationship with Jeremiah Wright can hardly be what it once was. Warren seems to have given the president-elect good reason to like him and value his advice; the two call each other friend. We may think whatever we want of either, but this may be more about them than us.    Update: In support of this view of Warren, here's an exchange with Steve Waldman from a  recent interview :        Did you ever talk to President Bush to try to convince him to change his policy?        No. No.        Why not?         Never got the chance. I just didnt. In fact, in the first place, Im a pastor, and people might misunderstand  I dont deal with policy issues with Barack Obama or President Clinton or John McCain. I just dont. Thats not my role. My role is to pastor these guys. As a leader I understand stress.        And even when I disagree with positions they hold, theyve got plenty of political advisors. They dont need me to be a political advisor. Im not a pundit. Im not a politician and thats why I dont take sides. But I am a pastor. And I can deal with hows your family doing? Hows your stress level doing?     (Originally published at  Spiritual Politics .)       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 22, 2008   |  Comments (0)        How Should Warren Then Pray?      | December 18, 2008    California megachurch pastor Rick Warren will be preaching at 16 Christmas services and was not available for an interview with  Christianity Today . However, he sent us a statement about his decision to pray at Barack Obama's inauguration, in response to the  criticism Obama has received  for inviting Warren.       ""I commend President-elect Obama for his courage to willingly take enormous heat from his base by inviting someone like me, with whom he doesnt agree on every issue, to offer the Invocation at his historic Inaugural ceremony.    Hopefully individuals passionately expressing opinions from the left and the right will recognize that both of us have shown a commitment to model civility in America.    The Bible admonishes us to pray for our leaders. I am honored by this opportunity to pray Gods blessing on the office of the President and its current and future inhabitant, asking the Lord to provide wisdom to Americas leaders during this critical time in our nations history.""       Obama's pick also begs the question that  David Waters asks  in the  Washington Post 's On Faith section: ""To Whose God Will Rick Warren Pray?""        Billy Graham used inclusive language when he delivered the Inaugural Invocation in 1989. ""0 God, we consecrate today George Herbert Walker Bush to the presidency of these United States,"" he said. But four years later, Graham ended his invocation at Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration this way: I pray this in the name of the one that's called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, the Everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace. Amen.""       Waters also reminds readers that in 2001, Franklin Graham ended his invocation with, ""in the name of the father, and of the son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit."" And Kirbyjon Caldwell ended with, ""'We respectfully submit this humble prayer in the name that's above all other names, Jesus the Christ.""    At the DNC,  Blue Like Jazz  author Donald Miller  ended his prayer  with ""I make these requests in the name of your son, Jesus, who gave his own life against the forces of injustice,"" putting a slight emphasis on I. Florida megachurch pastor Joel Hunter took a more unconventional approach during  his benediction .        Now I interrupt this prayer for a closing instruction. I want to personalize this. I want this to be a participatory prayer. And so therefore, because we are in a country that is still welcoming all faiths, I would like all of us to close this prayer in the way your faith tradition would close your prayer.  So on the count of three, I want all of you to end this prayer, your prayer, the way you usually end prayer. You ready? One, two, three.  In Jesus' name, Amen.  Let's go change the world for good.       Waters also asks another question: ""Does it matter?"" What do you think?       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 18, 2008   |  Comments (6)        Obama Defends Rick Warren's Inaugural Invocation Plans      |     Barack Obama defended  his choice  of California megapastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at next month's Inauguration, responding to  severe outcry  from gay rights advocates and  liberals .    ""I am a fierce advocate of equality for gay and lesbian Americans. It is something that I have been consistent on and something that I intend to continue to be consistent on in my presidency,""  Obama said  at a news conference this morning. ""What I've also said is that it is important for American to come together even though we may have disagreements on certain social issues.""    Gay rights advocates angrily denounced Obama's choice of Warren, who is an opponent of abortion rights and same-sex marriage.    Your invitation to Reverend Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at your inauguration is a genuine blow to LGBT Americans, the president of Human Rights Campaign, Joe Solomonese,  wrote to Obama yesterday . [W]e feel a deep level of disrespect when one of architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda is given the prominence and the pulpit of your historic nomination.""    To my knowledge, these groups didn't make a fuss when Florida megachurch pastor Joel Hunter, who also opposes abortion and same-sex marriage,  prayed with Obama  on Election Day and  prayed at the Democratic National Convention . However, these groups are  still stinging  from California's decision to ban gay marriage, which Warren vocally supported.         Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 18, 2008   |  Comments (30)        Rick Warren to Give Invocation at Obama Inauguration      | December 17, 2008    Rick Warren, senior pastor at Saddleback Church,  will give the invocation  at Barack Obamas inaugural swearing-in ceremony on January 20.    The benediction will be given by Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, dean of the civil rights movement and co-founder with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.    Obama will be the first president since Harry Truman not to have a close relationship with evangelist Billy Graham. Franklin Graham  told CT last month  that although his father is praying for and would like to meet Obama, his role as counselor is ending. Could Rick Warren fill that role?       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 17, 2008   |  Comments (16)        Rick Warren's Dark Night of the Soul     Steve Waldman  | December 15, 2008       Rick Warren is keeping a list, and checking it often.  He'll have to memorize it because he can't count on having his Blackberry when he needs this list most.  This is Rick Warren's list of questions for God.    In the course of a fascinating conversation last week with Beliefnet and our partner The Wall Street Journal -- click  here for video  of the full interview and  here for a transcript   -- Warren was stunningly candid about having doubts, even "" dark nights of the soul.""     ""Oh absolutely. All the time.""   ""What do you mean 'all the time'?""    ""I've never doubted God. But I've doubted why God does certain things...."".    There are parts of the Bible, for instance, that he doesn't get -- ""slaughters in the Bible and rules that don't seem to make sense and things that just don't seem to me, to be logical.""     ""And I still have doubts, I mean, I read the Bible and go 'whoa, why did God say that?'""    He concludes that these passages are mystifying because he just doesn't have ""the brain capacity"" to understand God -- but he is eager to ask Him a few questions at the appropriate moment.    One is why He gave humans the ability to have babies before they're ready to raise them.  He also wants to know how prayer works - why God answers some prayers right away and not others. ""The truth is, that the vast majority of our prayers, we don't see those kinds of miracles.""    But his number one question, he says, is about suffering:  ""I know why there's evil in the world, I don't understand why so much suffering happens to so many innocent people.""    I don't want to give the impression Warren has lost faith.  Quite the opposite.  Most of our talk was devoted to his absolute conviction that the real ""purpose of Christmas"" is understanding, treasuring and opening the gift of grace - the idea that Jesus said In effect, ""I've paid for everything you need to get into Heaven. I've paid your ticket..... That's the gift.""  ( Watch him talk about ""the gift"")    He offered an inspiring message about the  purpose of Christmas  (the topic of  his new book ) and some special devotionals for Beliefnet viewers.    He also dove headlong into some of the most controversial culture war issues, in ways likely to surprise and perhaps enrage some on the left and right.    Most Likely to Infuriate Liberals :                        Gay marriage is morally equivalent to allowing brothers and sisters to marry.   Watch.                       He opposes torture but didn't try to convince President Bush to change course because ""I never had the opportunity.""   Watch .                     A possibly veiled slap at Islam: ""He could have made us all puppets. ... He could have put us on strings and we'd pray five times a day and we'd have no choice.""   Watch .                      ""Abortion reduction"" efforts are  mostly a ""charade.""   Watch .                     His historical argument that ""social gospel"" Protestantism was ""just Marxism in Christian clothing"" and that ""the mainline [Protestants] died.""   Watch .       Most Likely to Infuriate Conservatives:                        He supports partnership rights for gays including insurance and visitation benefits. This appears to be a similar position to that which just prompted the resignation of a top official of the National Association of Evangelicals.   Watch .                     His declaration that it's a ""no brainer"" that divorce is a bigger threat to the American family than gay marriage, and that Christian leaders focus on gay marriage instead because ""we always love to talk about other people's sins.""   Watch .                       Religious conservatives have misled people into thinking Christ's message was primarily about conservative politics and that politics is the primary way to change culture.   Watch .                       The Bush administration seems to have engaged in torture, which he condemned.   Watch .                       While condemning abortion as a Holocaust and abortion reduction as a ""charade"" he nonetheless said he would support those efforts, which he equated to Schindler's list -- a way of reducing the harm of an overall evil.   Watch .       Most Likely to Titillate Theologians:                        While your behavior doesn't determine whether you get into heaven, it does determine what you do once you're there.   Watch .                     His statement that ""I really don't know"" whether people who don't know about Christ will be blocked entry into heaven.   Watch .                     ""God's will is not done most of the time on earth. When people go, 'oh, that hurricane must have been God's will' - baloney!""   Watch .       Most Likely to Inspire and Challenge:                        The story of his daughter in law's brain tumor and its surprising lesson the family learned.  Watch .                     His relentless commitment to awakening Americans to African poverty.   Watch .                     His personal Christmas prayer.    Watch .                     His argument that the economic collapse comes from abandoning Biblical principles of thrift.  Watch .       Moment I'd Most Like To Follow Up About:     Everyone will have their favorites. But for me the most interesting moment was after he described the gift of grace, and I then asked:  ""Why if he forgives us for murdering or raping would he not forgive us for not believing in Him?""  He took his best shot, but I'm not sure he totally nailed it.   Watch .    Click  here to buy Rick Warren's new book, The Purpose of Christmas .

clueweb09-enwp01-48-07501	"                     National Statement on Religious Diversity          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  National Statement on Religious Diversity  is a result of the  New Zealand Diversity Action Programme , and is intended to provide  a framework for the recognition of  New Zealand 's diverse faith communities and their harmonious interaction with each other, with government and with other groups in society.           Contents       1   Content   2   Background   3   Government ratification   4   Controversy   5   References               [ edit ]   Content   Preamble:  New Zealand is a country of many faiths with a significant minority who profess no religion. Increasing religious diversity is a significant feature of public life.   At the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Governor Hobson affirmed, in response to a question from Catholic Bishop Pompallier, ""the several faiths (beliefs) of England, of the Wesleyans, of Rome, and also Maori custom shall alike be protected"". This foundation creates the opportunity to reaffirm an acknowledgement of the diversity of beliefs in New Zealand.   Christianity has played and continues to play a formative role in the development of New Zealand in terms of the nation's identity, culture, beliefs, institutions and values.   New settlers have always been religiously diverse, but only recently have the numbers of some of their faith communities grown significantly as a result of migration from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. These communities have a positive role to play in our society. It is in this context that we recognise the right to religion and the responsibilities of religious communities.   International treaties including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights uphold the right to freedom of religion and belief - the right to hold a belief; the right to change one's religion or belief; the right to express one's religion or belief; and the right not to hold a belief. These rights are reflected in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and Human Rights Act. The right to religion entails affording this right to others and not infringing their human rights.   The following statement provides a framework for the recognition of New Zealand's diverse faith communities and their harmonious interaction with each other, with government and with other groups in society:   1. The State and Religion     The State seeks to treat all faith communities and those who profess no religion equally before the law. New Zealand has no official or established religion.     2. The Right to Religion     New Zealand upholds the right to freedom of religion and belief and the right to freedom from discrimination on the grounds of religious or other belief.     3. The Right to Safety     Faith communities and their members have a right to safety and security.     4. The Right of Freedom of Expression     The right to freedom of expression and freedom of the media are vital for democracy but should be exercised with responsibility.     5. Recognition and Accommodation     Reasonable steps should be taken in educational and work environments and in the delivery of public services to recognise and accommodate diverse religious beliefs and practices.     6. Education     Schools should teach an understanding of different religious and spiritual traditions in a manner that reflects the diversity of their national and local community.     7. Religious Differences     Debate and disagreement about religious beliefs will occur but must be exercised within the rule of law and without resort to violence.     8. Cooperation and understanding     Government and faith communities have a responsibility to build and maintain positive relationships with each other, and to promote mutual respect and understanding.       [ edit ]   Background   The statement was prepared by the  Victoria University   Religious Studies  Programme and authored by Programme Director  Professor Paul Morris . The statement was the subject of a national process of public consultation coordinated by the  Human Rights Commission , and was endorsed by the National Interfaith Forum in  Hamilton  in February 2007 as a basis for ongoing public discussion.     [ edit ]   Government ratification   Prime Minister   Helen Clark  presented the statement to the third  Asia-Pacific Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation  to be held at  Waitangi  from May 29-31, 2007.     [ edit ]   Controversy   The Statement has caused some controversy over its first clause, which states that ""New Zealand has no official or established religion."" Opponents of the statement argue New Zealand's head of state  Queen Elizabeth II  is the supreme governor of the  Church of England  (although not in Her Majesty's capacity as Queen of New Zealand).  Brian Tamaki , a Bishop of the  Destiny Church  stated: ""That [Christianity] is the chosen religion of the Head of the Commonwealth. For us to depart from that, don't you think that that is bordering on creating some type of treason, religious treason anyhow?"" [ 1 ] . However, a poll of 501 New Zealanders by  Research New Zealand  in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion  [ 2 ] .   Another source of controversy has been the fact that the composition of the working group managing the formulation of the National Statement and its endorsement was limited to representatives of religious groups. Consequently, while extending some rights to non-religious people the Statement did omit to extend the right of safety (clause 4). This has led to some criticism from representatives of non-religious beliefs.     [ edit ]   References       ^   Collins, Simon.

Contents       1   History   2   The Modern Order   3   Sources   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   The order arose in the city of  Mechlin , in the  Duchy of Brabant  (in central  Flanders , now  Belgium ), in the fifteenth century, during the terrible ravages of a  pandemic  called the  ""Black Death.""  Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.
