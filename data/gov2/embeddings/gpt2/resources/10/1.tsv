Two distinct systems for           pretreating wool/cotton fabrics, before dyeing them to union shades, were   investigated: the traditional (including low-and non-formaldehyde-          releasing) resins designed to impart durable press properties to cotton,    and certain commercial dye fixatives originally designed to increase        colorfastness in dyed cotton textiles.  Union shades with superior          colorfastness were found for a low-formaldehyde resin together with a       simple nitrogen-containing compound so that home laundering could be        prescribed.  As for the dye fixative systems, though union shades were      obtained there was limited color stability and this would require the ""dry  clean only"" label.  However, this limitation was overcome by using one      type of dye fixative, a cyanoguanidine, as the pretreatment to dyeing with  wool-reactive dyes.  The advantage to using dye fixative pretreatment       systems over resin systems is one of uniform application and processing     ease.  Resin systems require padding and baking and can lead to uneven      finishing of the fabric for uneven dye uptake.  Dye fixative systems, on    the other hand, allow simple and even application by immersing the fabric   in a solution bath at room temperature; subsequent dyeing leads to even     dye uptake.  The ability to dye wool/cotton to union shades with good       fastness properties will open new markets for comfortable, all-seasonal     apparel incorporating wool.  This will lead to a greater demand for wool    while adding greater value to cotton.

R-7 A-39 P-17  C. Identify basic methods of fabric construction. 1. Weaving (types of weaves) a. Plain weave (1) Defined: simplest and most common weave in which each weft/filling yarn passes successively over and under each warp yarn, alternating with each row. The result is a fabric that is strong and durable. The basket weave is a variation of the plain weave in which two or more yarns are passed successively over and under each other. (2) Fabric examples: broadcloth, chambray, chiffon, gingham, muslin, organdy, percale, poplin, sailcloth, seersucker, shantung, and taffeta. b. Twill weave (1) Defined: formed by passing a filling yarn over and under one, two, or three warp yarns, lapping back one warp yarn in each row. The twill weave creates diagonal ridges on the surface of the fabric called wales. The result is a very strong and durable fabric that is also wrinkle and soil resistant. Herringbone is a variation of a twill weave in which the direction of the ridge reverses itself. (2) Fabric examples: denim, gabardine, serge, surah, and ticking. c. Satin weave (1) Defined: characterized by long yarn floa ts on the surface of the fabric giving a smooth, lustrous appearance. (2) Fabric examples: sateen, satin. d. Variation weaves (1) Pile weave (a) Defined: formed by interlacing three sets of yarns with two sets forming the background and a third (cut or uncut) used to give a three-dimensional effect. Cut pile fabrics have a nap. (b) Fabric examples: corduroy, terrycloth, velvet and fake furs. (2) Dobby weave (a) Defined: uses an attachment that permits the weaving of geometric designs. (b) Fabric examples: fabrics with dots or geometric designs. (3) Jacquard weave (a) Defined: created when simple or complex designs are woven into the fabrics using a complicated type of loom.

(2) Fabric examples: double knits, interlock knits, jersey, ribbed knits, single knits, and sweater knits. b. Warp knits (1) Defined: made on flat knitting machines, with several yarns and needles. Loops are interlocking in the lengthwise direction. Warp knits have selvage edges and do not ravel. (2) Fabric examples : raschel knits and tricot. 3. Other forms of fabric construction a. Types (1) Nonwoven: a fabric in which textile fibers are compacted together using a combination of moisture, heat, chemicals, friction, and /or pressure. (2) Nets and laces : openwork fabrics made by knotting, twisting, or looping yarns. They can be constructed by hand or machine. (3) Braiding : process of interlacing three or more yarns to form a regular diagonal pattern down the length of the resulting cord. (4) Bonding : a method of permanently fastening together two layers of fabric by lamination. A chemical adhesive may be used or the layers may be fused with a web of fibers that melts when heat is applied. (5) Quilting : a layer of padding or batting is sandwiched between two layers and then held in place by machine stitching around decorative areas.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.   Applied commercially, these technologies may cut textile dyeing costs—savings that can be passed on to consumers seeking versatile garments for spring and fall.—By  Tara Weaver-Missick,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

GX087-21-7235310	TEKTRAN   IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR DETECTING COLOR UNIFORMITY IN DYED TEXTILES      Author(s):    CARDAMONE  JEANETTE M              DAMERT  WILLIAM C                          Interpretive Summary:      Evenness or uniformity of color is subjective while quality of color in     terms of value, purity, and hue is objective through instrumental           (colorimetric) measurement.  Thus the textile industry is in need of an     objective measurement system for uniformity of color.  An image analysis    system configured with a TV camera, personal computer, and image analysis   hardware and software was used to capture and store the digital images of   dyed fabrics to analyze the fabrics for uniform coloration after dyeing.    The system was successfully tested on wool, cotton, and wool/cotton         blended fabrics that had been the object of research for chemically         imparting uniform coloration.

BioPreparation™ of Cotton Textiles:             A Cost Effective, Environmentally Compatible             Preparation Process            In textiles, the source of one of the most negative impacts on the            environment originates from traditional processes used to prepare cotton            fiber, yarn, and fabric. Fabric preparation consists of a series of            various treatments and rinsing steps critical to obtaining good results            in subsequent textile finishing processes. These water-intensive wet            processing steps generate large volumes of wastes, particularly from            alkaline scouring and continuous/batch dyeing. These wastes include            large amounts of salts, acids, and alkali. In view of the 40 billion            pounds of cotton fiber that are prepared annually on a global scale,            it becomes clear that the preparation process is a major source of environmentally            harsh chemical contribution to the environment.              Cotton wax, a natural component in the outer layer of cotton fibers,            is a major obstacle in processing textiles and must be removed to ""prepare""            the textile for dyeing and finishing. Conventional chemical preparation            processes involve treatment of the cotton substrate with hot solutions            of sodium hydroxide, chelating agents, and surface active agents, often            followed by a neutralization step with acetic acid. The scouring process            is designed to break down or release natural waxes, oils, and contaminants,            and emulsify or suspend these impurities in the scouring bath. Typically,            scouring wastes contribute high BOD loads during cotton textile preparation            (as much as 50%).             Novozymes' BioPreparation™ technology is an alternative to sodium            hydroxide that offers many advantages for textile wet processing, including            reduced BOD/COD and decreased water use. BioPreparation™ is an            enzymatic process for treating cotton textiles that meets the performance            characteristics of alkaline scour systems while reducing chemical and            effluent load. Pectate lyase is the main scouring agent that degrades            pectin to release the entangled waxes and other components from the            cotton surface. The enzyme is also compatible with other enzymatic preparations            (amylases, cellulases) used to improve the performance properties of            cotton fabrics.             The practical implications that BioPreparation™ technology has            on the textile industry are realized in terms of conservation of chemicals,            water, energy, and time. Based on field trials, textile mills may save            as much as 30 to 50% in water costs by replacing caustic scours or by            combining the usually separate scouring and dyeing steps into one. This            water savings results because BioPreparation™ uses fewer rinsing            steps than required during a traditional caustic scour. Significant            time savings were also demonstrated by combining treatment steps. A            recent statistical survey determined that 162 knitting mills typically            use 89 million m3/year of water in processing goods from scouring to            finishing; the BioPreparation™ approach would save from 27 to 45            million m3/year of water. In addition, field trials established that            BOD and COD loads are decreased by 25 and 40%, respectively, when compared            to conventional sodium hydroxide treatments. Furthermore, these conservation            measures translate directly into costs savings of 30% or more. As such,            this patented process provides an economical and environmentally friendly            alternative to alkaline scour systems currently used in the textile            industry today.

GX100-87-13770133	TEKTRAN   EFFECTIVE BIGUANIDE PRETREATMENTS FOR UNION DYEING WOOL/COTTON BLENDS      Author(s):    CARDAMONE  JEANETTE M              MARMER  WILLIAM N                  PHILLIPS  JOHN G                           Interpretive Summary:      There is difficulty in union dyeing (same color on wool and cotton) wool in the presence of cotton by an efficient and easy process because wool and    cotton require different types of dyes.  Wool and cotton blended textiles   were pretreated before dyeing with nitrogen-containing compounds having     similar chemical structures, and designed as commercial products to improve the dyeability of cotton.  After pretreatments, only the cotton in the      blend was modified and thus it dyed to the same color as wool in the same   dyebath.  Wool and cotton dyes proved effective for union dyeing after      these pretreatments.  The most effective and efficient conditions for       applying these compounds for union dyeing with wool dyes were by padding    the solution on with rollers and this could be done at lower concentrations than when the compounds were applied by leaving the fabrics in solutions    (exhaust).  One pretreatment compound provided antibacterial properties but was found to be not as versatile as the other compound for providing union  shades over a broad range of pretreatment concentrations when cotton dyes   were used.  Based on the colorfastness properties of the union dyed         wool/cotton fabrics, recommendations were made for use as outerwear with    labeling for dry-cleaning only.  This work established the lowest           pretreatment conditions for concentration, acidity/basicity, time, and      temperature of application.   Overall these compounds provided an expedient method for union dyeing by padding and by exhaust and the methods proved to be efficient, economical, and ecologically sound.  This will benefit the    textile industry and wool growers by opening a new market for wool.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.   Applied commercially, these technologies may cut textile dyeing costs—savings that can be passed on to consumers seeking versatile garments for spring and fall.—By  Tara Weaver-Missick,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.

Site Map              Search                                   Dyeing   Dyeing operations are used at various stages of production to add color and intricacy to textiles and increase product value. Most dyeing is performed either by the finishing division of vertically integrated textile companies, or by specialty dyehouses. Specialty dyehouses operate either on a commission basis or purchase greige goods and finish them before selling them to apparel and other product manufacturers. Textiles are dyed using a wide range of dyestuffs, techniques and equipment.   Dyes  used by the textile industry are largely synthetic, typically derived from coal tar and petroleum-based intermediates. Dyes are sold as powders, granules, pastes and liquid dispersions, with concentrations of active ingredients ranging typically from 20 to 80 percent.   Methods of Dyeing   Dyeing can be performed using continuous or batch processes. In batch dyeing, a certain amount of textile substrate, usually 100 to 1,000 kilograms, is loaded into a dyeing machine and brought to equilibrium, or near equilibrium, with a solution containing the dye. Because the dyes have an affinity for the fibers, the dye molecules leave the dye solution and enter the fibers over a period of minutes to hours, depending on the type of dye and fabric used. Auxiliary chemicals and controlled dyebath conditions (mainly temperature) accelerate and optimize the action. The dye is fixed in the fiber using heat and/or chemicals, and the tinted textile substrate is washed to remove unfixed dyes and chemicals. Common methods of batch, or exhaust, dyeing include beam, beck, jet and jig processing (see picture to the left). Pad dyeing can be performed by either batch or continuous processes.   In continuous dyeing processes, textiles are fed continuously into a dye range at speeds usually between 50 and 250 meters per minute. Continuous dyeing accounts for about 60 percent of total yardage of product dyed in the industry (Snowden-Swan, 1995). To be economical, this may require the dyer to process 10,000 meters of textiles or more per color, although specialty ranges are now being designed to run as little as 2,000 meters economically. Continuous dyeing processes typically consist of dye application, dye fixation with chemicals or heat, and washing.    Dye fixation is a measure of the amount of the percentage of dye in a bath that will fix to the fibers of the textile material. Dye fixation on the fiber occurs much more rapidly in continuous dying than in batch dyeing. Each dyeing process requires different amounts of dye per unit of fabric to be dyed. This is significant since color and salts in wastewater from spent dyes are often a pollution concern for textile facilities. In addition, less dye used results in energy conservation and chemical savings. The amounts of dye used depends on the dye exhausted from the dyebaths which determines the required dyebath ratio. The dyebath ratio is the ratio of the units of dye required per unit of fabric and typically ranges from 5 to 50 depending on the type of dye, dyeing system and affinity of the dyes for the fibers.   Dyeing processes may take place at any of several stages of the manufacturing process (fibers, yarn, piece-dyeing). Stock dyeing is used to dye fibers. Top dyeing is used to dye combed wool sliver. Yarn dyeing and piece dyeing is done after the yarn has been constructed into fabric.       Yarn Dyeing.  Yarn dyeing is used to create interesting checks,   stripes and plaids with different-colored yarns in the weaving process. In yarn dyeing, dyestuff penetrates the fibers in the core of the yarn. Some methods of yarn dyeing are stock,   package and skein dyeing. Stock dyeing dyes fiber using perforated tubes. In package dyeing, spools of yarn are stacked on perforated rods in a rack and immersed in a tank where dye is then forced outward from the rods under pressure. The dye is then pressured back through the packages toward the center to fully penetrate the entire yarn. Most carded and combed cotton used for knitted outerwear is package-dyed. In skein dyeing, yarn is loosely coiled on a reel and then dyed. The coils, or skeins, are hung over a rung and immersed in a dyebath (Corbman, 1975). Skein-dyed yarn is used for bulky acrylic and wool yarns. Typical capacity for package dyeing equipment is 1,210   lbs (550 kg) and for skein dyeing equipment is 220 lbs (100 kg).     Piece Dyeing.  Most dyed fabric is piece-dyed since this method gives the manufacturer maximum inventory flexibility to meet color demands as fashion changes. In terms of overall volume, the largest amount of dyeing is performed using beck and jig equipment (Figure 11). Beck dyeing is a versatile, continuous process used to dye long yards of fabric. About 1,980   lbs (900 kg) of fabric can be dyed on beck equipment at a time. The fabric is passed in rope form through the dyebath. The rope moves over a rail onto a reel which immerses it into the dye and then draws the fabric up and forward to the front of the machine. This process is repeated as long as necessary to dye the material uniformly to the desired color intensity. Jig dyeing uses the same procedure of beck   dyeing; however, the fabric is held on rollers at full width rather than in rope form as it is passed through the dyebath (Corbman, 1975). This reduces fabric tendency to crack or crease. Jig dyeing equipment can handle 550   lbs (250 kg) of fabric. Other piece dyeing methods include jet dyeing and pad dyeing. Fabric can be jet-dyed   [at up to 1,100 lbs (500 kg)] by placing it in a heated tube or column where jets of dye solution are forced through it at high pressures. The dye is continually recirculated as the fabric is moved along the tube. Pad dyeing, like jig dyeing, dyes the fabric at full width. The fabric is passed through a trough containing dye and then between two heavy rollers which force the dye into the cloth and squeeze out the excess (Corbman, 1975).
