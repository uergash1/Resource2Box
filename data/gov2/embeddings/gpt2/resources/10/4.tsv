Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                 Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                   1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?
