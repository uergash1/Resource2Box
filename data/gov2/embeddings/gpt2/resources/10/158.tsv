MUMmer uses an efficient data structure called a suffix tree, which allows it very rapidly to align sequences containing millions of nucleotides.  Its use will be demonstrated on several pairs of strains of bacteria, ranging from very highly homologous organisms to much more distantly related organisms.  For very similar organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Rv and CDC1551, the system allows one to quickly catalog all SNPs and all significant insertions.  For more distantly related organisms the system helps provide a mapping between the genes and also identifies significant rearrangements.  For example, it was recently used to identify major segmental duplications between the chromosomes of Arabidopsis thaliana.  It also led to the recent discovery of a new phenomenon in genome structure: a 2-way whole genome palindromic alignment between E. coli and V. cholerae.  Glimmer 2.0, the newest version of the Glimmer system for microbial gene identification, now finds approximately 97--98% of all genes in a genome when compared with published annotation.  Glimmer uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) as a framework for capturing dependencies between nearby nucleotides in a DNA sequence.  When we consider only those genes that have significant homology to genes in other organisms, Glimmer's accuracy rises to better than 99%.  Some recent improvements will be described as well as an evaluation on ten completed genomes.

There are two ways to join the mailing list if you're at NIH.  (If you're not at NIH, contact rweisberg@nih.gov to join.)  (1) Send the following message from the computer where you usually receive mail to LISTSERV@LIST.NIH.GOV: SUBSCRIBE LAMBDA_LUNCH-L your name. Replace ""your name"" by your first and last names.  (2) Go to http://list.nih.gov/.  Browse the lists to find Lambda_Lunch-L.  Follow the instructions to join.  This schedule is also available at http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/lambda.html.

Thompson CDS INSTRUMENT: Discovered that the optical bench temperature mnemonic  BTM12 was 1 degree higher than all other optical bench temperature   mnemonics.  It is believed that during the reboot on the 15th, the  high temperature value may have been improperly read by the processor  onboard and set the value at 24 degrees, instead of the nominal 23  degrees.  The commands were resent, and the temperature did lower to  23 degrees. CDS GROUND SYSTEM: Nominal. DAY PLAN: Science Operations.
