Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

clueweb09-en0007-20-28205	"  Main Page  |  See live article  |  Alphabetical index               Korean language The  Korean language  is spoken primarily and officially in  Korea  ( South Korea  and  North Korea ), also in the  People's Republic of China  ( Yanbian ). Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada , and  Japan . Korean is considered by many to be a member of the  Altaic family , but its proper  classification  is not universally agreed on.  The native Korean writing system, the  Hangul  is alphabetic and phonetic.  Along with  Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ), well over 50% of the Korean vocabulary comes directly or indirectly from from  Chinese .

The Korean names for Korean are:   in North Korea are:    Chosŏnŏ  (in  McCune-Reischauer  romanization, as used in North Korea; 조선어) or     Chosŏnmal  (조선말)   in South Korea are:    Hangugeo  (in  Revised Romanization of Korea , as used in Soth Korea; 한국어) or     Hangungmal  (한국말).  History   Classification and related languages  Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korea has genetic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late.  It does have some semblances considering the  morphology to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakutsk and some of its variants, and some linguistics believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger Ural-Altaic language family.  Korean's seemingly similarities, especially vocabulary and certain prounciations, to Chinese (of the  Sino-Tibetan family ) is superificial and not genetic. They occurred because of close and frequent contacts during the time of recorded history.   Geographic distribution   Dialects  Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal ,  bangeon , or  saturi  in Korean).  The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  Pyeongyang .  These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of Jeju (Cheju) Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists.  One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul  Dialect use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of  Gyeongsang  Dialect have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  Although the naming and grouping of dialects is always changing as the study of dialects develops, here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:     Dialect Where Used   Seoulmal Seoul ,  Incheon , Gaeseong Cities,  Gyeonggi ,  Gangweon , North/South  Hwanghae  Provinces   Pyeonganmal Pyeongyang, Nampo Cities, North/South Pyeongan, Jagang Provinces   Chungcheongmal Daejeon  City, North/South  Chungcheong  Provinces   Jeollamal Gwangju  City, North/South  Jeolla  Provinces   Gyeongsangmal Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan  Cities, North/South  Gyeongsang  Provinces   Jejumal Jeju  Island/Province   Hamgyeongmal Cheongjin, Najin-Seonbong Cities, North/South Hamgyeong,  Yanggang  Provinces       Sounds   Consonants                           Bilabial      Alveolar      Palatal      Velar      Glottal             Stop      plain      p      t      c      k                   tensed      p’      t’      c’      k’                   aspirated      p h      t h      c h      k h                    Fricative      plain             s                    h            tensed             s’                                  Nasal      m      n             ŋ                    Lateral approximant             l                            Example words for consonants:        phoneme    IPA    Romanized    English        p    pal    bal    'foot'        p’    p’al    ppal    'sucking'         p h    p h al    pal    'arm'        m    mal    mal    'horse'        t    tal    dal    'moon'        t’    t’al    ttal    'daughter'         t h    t h al    tal    'riding'        n    nal    nal    'day'        c    cal    jal    'well'        c’    c’al    jjal    'squeezing'         c h    c h al    chal    'kicking'        k    kal    gal    'goin'        k’    k’al    kkal    'spreading'         k h    k h al    kal    'knife'        ŋ    baŋ    bang    'room'        s    sal    sal    'flesh'        s’    s’al    ssal    'rice'         l    balam    baram    'wind'        h    hal    hal    'doing'      [c], [cʰ], and [c'] have more frication than the other stops and are sometimes described as affricates.   The symbol [’] is used to denote the tensed consonants ([p’], [t’], [c’], [k’], and [s’]) but its official  IPA  usage is for ejective consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure.  [s] becomes [ʃ] or [ɕ] before [j] or [i].  [h] becomes [ɸ] before [u] and [ç] before [i] or [j]  [p], [t], [c], and [k] become voiced [b], [d], [ɟ], and [ɡ] between sonorant segments.  Vowels     Monophthongs  Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. The close-mid front rounded vowel [ø] can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but it has largely been replaced by the diphthong [we]. Similarly, the length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but it is no longer made by most younger speakers.          i    siˈɟaŋ    zijang    'hunger'    iː    ˈsiːɟaŋ    zijang    'market'        e    beˈɡɛ    begae    'pillow'    eː    ˈbeːda    beda    'to cut'        ɛ    tʰɛˈjaŋ    taeyang    'sun'    ɛː    ˈtʰɛːdo    taedo    'attitude'        a    ˈmal    mal    'horse'    aː    ˈmaːl    mal    'speech'        o    poˈli    bori    'barley'    oː    ˈpoːsu    bozu    'salary'        u    kuˈli    guri    'bronze'    uː    ˈsuːbak    zubak    'bronze'        ʌ    ˈpʌl    beol    'punishment'    ʌː    ˈpʌːl    beol    'bee'        ɯ    ˈʌːlɯn    eoreun    'seniors'    ɯː    ˈɯːmzik    eumzik    'food'     Diphthongs and glides  [j] and [w] are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                      wi dwi dwi 'back'        ɯi' ˈɯisa uiza 'doctor'     je ˈjeːs’aŋ yessang 'budget'        we kwe gwe 'box'                    jɛ ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'        wɛ wɛ wae 'why'                    ja ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'        wa kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                    jo ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                   ju juˈli yuri 'glass'                                   jʌ jʌːgi yeogi 'here'        wʌ mwʌ mwo 'what'                   Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association   Phonology  Phonetic rules, mostly assimilation, transform the pronunciation of some words.

For example,   p -> b   t -> d   k -> g   Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,   p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)   Hangeul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology.   Grammar  Korean is an  agglutinative language . Korean grammar is similar to that of the Japanese language. The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. Accordingly, whereas in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food"", in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see theme and rheme) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:   H: ""가게에 가세요?""  G: ""예.""   H: *""store-to going-are?""  G: ""yes.""   which in English would translate to:  H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""   Unlike Romance languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honored persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of  Spanish  and  German .   Speech Levels and Honorifics  The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this.  The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .   Honorifics  When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority.  Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like.  Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee, or the like.  On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones.  A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food.""  More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives.  Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim .  (The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeong  (older sibling of the same sex) becomes  hyeongnim .)  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -shi-  (시) after the  stem  and before the verb ending.  Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gashida .  A few verbs have special honorific equivalents.  So  gyeshida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsushida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumushida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations.  These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").   Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an auxiliary verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer.""  Derived from  ollida  is the noun  ollim , which is the humble form of  seonmul  (""gift"").  Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangshin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu,"" the usual word for ""friend) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular)).   Speech Levels  There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.  Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience.  The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix che, which means ""body.""  The highest 5 levels use final verb endings, while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final endings and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean.  (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems.  Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present  indicative form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.     Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now only used in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people;  Samuel E. Martin 's 1954 book  Korean in a Hurry  states that it was the form used by police officers when giving out traffic tickets!   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Informal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age.  Traditionally used more by women than men, though in  Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people.  It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     Vocabulary  The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words.  Roughly 70% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Sino-Korean  words, which are derived from  Chinese characters .  Many of these words were borrowed from  Chinese , although many modern-day scientific terms come from  Japanese .  To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages.  In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from Western languages such as  German  and, more recently,  English .     Writing system   Main article:  Hangul  The Korean language was originally written using "" Hanja "", or  Chinese characters ; it is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write  Sino-Korean  words. Hangeul consists of 24 letters -- 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in blocks of 2 to 5 characters.  Unlike the  Chinese  writing system and the  Japanese   Kanji  system, Hangul is not an  ideographic  system.  The shapes of the individual Hangul letters were designed to model the physical morphology of the tongue, palate and teeth; up to five letters join to form a syllabic unit.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  SAMPA  values:                                       Consonants     p   t    c   k        ᄇ   ᄃ   ᄌ   ᄀ        p’   t’   c’   k’        ᄈ   ᄄ   ᄍ   ᄁ        p h   t h   c h   k h        ᄑ   ᄐ   ᄎ   ᄏ            s       h            ᄉ       ᄒ            s’                    ᄊ                m   n       N        ᄆ   ᄂ       ᄋ        w   r   j            (n/a)   ᄅ   (n/a)                           Vowels     i   e   }   a   o   u   7   M         ᅵ   ᅦ   ᅢ   ᅡ   ᅩ   ᅮ   ᅥ   ᅳ         Mi   je   j}   ja   jo   ju   j7             ᅴ   ᅨ   ᅤ   ᅣ   ᅭ   ᅲ   ᅧ             ui   ue   o}   oa           u7             ᅱ   ᅰ   ᅫ   ᅪ           ᅯ               (See also:  Hangul consonant tables )  Modern Korean is written with  spacess  between  words , a feature not found in the other  CJK  languages (Chinese and Japanese).  Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones.  Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, much as in other East Asian cultures.  Korean is often still written in columns (especially in newspapers and poetry), but is now more usually now written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

Korean is also used by democratic state governments and companies, outside Korea, as a secondary language to assist in public service and to provide corporate customer services. All in all, the language is used by more than 75 million people in the world.   The Korean language is a member of a wider linguistic family of the Altaic languages. The Korean writing system, Hangeul, was invented in 1446 by King Sejong to widely spread education as the Chinese characters was thought to be difficult for a common person to learn through the proclamation of Hoonminjungeum [훈민정음/訓民正音)] which literally means the ""proper sounds to teach the general public."" It is different from the Chinese form of written communication as it is phonetically based.   Numerous underlying words still stem from Hanja and older people in Korea still prefer to write words in Hanja, as they were strictly forbidden to study and speak the Korean language when Japan ruled. Koreans are the only people in the world who fully understand how, when and why their written language was created through the transcripts of King Sejong's innovative contributions.

Classification     Korean, as such, is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own. Its former link to  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does have some semblances considering the  morphology  to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakutsk[?]  and some of its variants.   Though some may think that the Korean language is clearly different to  Japanese , this is due to the Japanese using non-Chinese readings to some  Chinese characters . For instance, the city of ""Hitachi"" (日立) is pronounced ""Il-Lip"" in Korean. This is a case where the Japanese word ""Tachi"" (meaning ""standing"") is used instead of Chinese-based ""Ritsu"". In other words, there are irregularities for pronouncing  Hanja  (or "" Kanji "") in the Japanese language, due to Japanese using and adapting the Chinese script to the Japanese language. Korean knows no such diviation, due to adoption of the Korean alphabet  Hangul .   It should be noted, however, that it were the  Koreans  of  Baekjae[?]  that taught and spread Chinese characters to the  Japanese  during the 7th century which gives explaination for gramatical similarities.

The  standard language[?]  of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  Pyongyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of Jeju (Cheju) Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by many Korean linguists. Jeju Dialect has a structure similar to Japanese, so it is suspected as evidence of a relationship between Korean and Japanese.                            Send this page                                                     Link to this page:  The easy way to educate your website visitors.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners.

This language has its own  Wikipedia  Project. You can visit and contribute at the  Korean language Wikipedia .     The  Korean language  is the most widely used language in  Korea , and is the official language of both  South  and  North  Korea.  The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the  Altaic  family of languages.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in South and North Korea.    In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""    History   The native written script,  Hangul , was devised in 1446, under the decree of  King Sejong .   Hanja  has also been used extensively since the early first millennium, mainly to represent  Sino-Korean  words, but also in the period before the introduction of Hangul, to represent words of native Korean origin.    Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korea has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and some linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty.    Geographic distribution   Dialects   Main article:  Dialects of Korean   (under construction)   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of Seoul Dialect use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:            Standard Dialect     Where Used        Seoul    Seoul ,  Incheon ,  Gyeonggi  ( South Korea );  Kaesŏng  ( North Korea )       P'yŏngan    P'yŏngyang ,  P'yŏngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)        Regional Dialect     Where Used        Chungcheong    Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon    Gangwon  (South Korea)/ Kangwŏn  (North Korea)       Gyeongsang    Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyŏng    Rasŏn , Hamgyŏng region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae    Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju    Jeju  Island/Province (South Korea)       Jeolla    Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)        Sounds   Consonants             Bilabial  Alveolar  Palatal  Velar  Glottal      Stop  plain   p   t   c   k         tensed   p’   t’   c’   k’         aspirated   p h    t h    c h    k h         Fricative   plain     s       h       tensed     s’            Nasal   m   n     ŋ        Lateral approximant     l          Example words for consonants:           phoneme     IPA     Romanized     English           p     pal     bal     'foot'           p’     p’al     ppal     'sucking'            p h     p h al     pal     'arm'           m     mal     mal     'horse'           t     tal     dal     'moon'           t’     t’al     ttal     'daughter'            t h     t h al     tal     'riding'           n     nal     nal     'day'           c     cal     jal     'well'           c’     c’al     jjal     'squeezing'            c h     c h al     chal     'kicking'           k     kal     gal     'going'           k’     k’al     kkal     'spreading'            k h     k h al     kal     'knife'           ŋ     paŋ     bang     'room'           s     sal     sal     'flesh'           s’     s’al     ssal     'rice'            l     palam     baram     'wind'           h     hal     hal     'doing'        [c], [cʰ], and [c'] have more frication than the other stops and are sometimes described as affricates.   The symbol [’] is used to denote the tensed consonants ([p’], [t’], [c’], [k’], and [s’]) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure.    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. The close-mid front rounded vowel [ø] can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but it has largely been replaced by the diphthong [we]. Similarly, the length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but it is no longer made by most younger speakers.           i     siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'     iː     ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'           e     peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'     eː     ˈpeːda     beda     'to cut'           ɛ     tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'     ɛː     ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'           a     ˈmal     mal     'horse'     aː     ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'           o     poˈli     bori     'barley'     oː     ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'           u     kuˈli     guri     'copper'     uː     ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'           ʌ     ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'     ʌː     ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'           ɯ     ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'     ɯː     ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j] and [w] are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                         wi dwi dwi 'back'         ɯi' ˈɯisa uiza 'doctor'      je ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'         we kwe gwe 'box'                      jɛ ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'         wɛ wɛ wae 'why'                      ja ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'         wa kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                      jo ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                      ju juˈli yuri 'glass'                                      jʌ jʌːgi yeogi 'here'         wʌ mwʌ mwo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s] becomes palatalized as [ʃ] or [ɕ] before [j] or [i].  [h] becomes labialized [ɸ] before [o] and [u] and palatalized [ç] before [i] or [j]  [p], [t], [c], and [k] become voiced [b], [d], [ɟ], and [ɡ] between  sonorant  segments.  [l] becomes alveolar flap [ɾ] between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial [r]. For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   鴨綠江 north:  Am r okgang , south:  Am n okgang  (name of a River)   心理學 north:  shim r ihak , south:  shim n ihak  (psychology)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony . It is not as prevalent in modern usage however, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives , and  adverbs .    Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. Accordingly, whereas in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Unlike Romance languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .     Speech Levels and Honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . (The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb ending. Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    Speech Levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  che , which means ""body.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb endings, while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final endings and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present  indicative form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age. Traditionally used more by women than men, though in  Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people. It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Hanja  ( Sino-Korean ) words, which are derived from  Chinese characters . To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from  Western languages  such as  German  and, more recently,  English .  The numbers are a good example of borrowing. Like  Japanese , Korean has two number systems—one native and one borrowed from the Chinese—so Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and some other languages such as  Thai  all appear to have similar words for numbers.    Writing system   Main article:  Hangul   The Korean language was originally written using "" Hanja "", or  Chinese characters ; it is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write  Sino-Korean  words. Hangul consists of 24 letters -- 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in blocks of 2 to 5 characters. Unlike the  Chinese  writing system (including  Japanese   Kanji ), Hangul is not an  ideographic  system. The shapes of the individual Hangul letters were designed to model the physical morphology of the tongue, palate and teeth; up to five letters join to form a syllabic unit.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  SAMPA  values:        Consonants       p   t    c   k           ᄇ   ᄃ   ᄌ   ᄀ           p’   t’   c’   k’           ᄈ   ᄄ   ᄍ   ᄁ           p h   t h   c h   k h           ᄑ   ᄐ   ᄎ   ᄏ               s       h               ᄉ       ᄒ               s’                       ᄊ                   m   n       N           ᄆ   ᄂ       ᄋ           w   r   j               (n/a)   ᄅ   (n/a)               Vowels       i   e   }   a   o   u   7   M            ᅵ   ᅦ   ᅢ   ᅡ   ᅩ   ᅮ   ᅥ   ᅳ            Mi   je   j}   ja   jo   ju   j7                ᅴ   ᅨ   ᅤ   ᅣ   ᅭ   ᅲ   ᅧ                ui   ue   o}   oa           u7                ᅱ   ᅰ   ᅫ   ᅪ           ᅯ                (See also:  Hangul consonant tables )  Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in the other  CJK  languages (Chinese and Japanese). Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, much as in other East Asian cultures. Korean is still sometimes written in columns (especially in poetry), but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. However, it is very difficult to argue that similarities in such key terms like ""water"" and the verbs ""to be"" ""to go"" would arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as Homer B. Hulbert (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  susa ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.
