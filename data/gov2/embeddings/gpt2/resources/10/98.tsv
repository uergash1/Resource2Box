(osa di Parmameans it stuffed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and prosciutto.) Typically made with beef, it is equally delicious and more economical made with pork tenderloin and ideal for entertaining parties of 8 to 10. Seek out true Italian Prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano-Reggiano for this dishven though they are more costly, the superior flavor is worth the expense.                       Makes 10 servings               ACTIVE TIME:  25 minutes               TOTAL TIME:  55 minutes               EASE OF PREPARATION:  Moderate                 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage  1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic  1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary  1 teaspoon kosher salt  1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  2 pork tenderloins (1-1 1/4 pounds each), trimmed  4 thin slices Italian Parma ham (Prosciutto di Parma), divided  1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided  3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided                1. Combine sage, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.   2. Preheat oven to 450°F.  3. Youe going to double butterfly the tenderloins, so they can be flattened, stuffed and rolled. To do that, youl make two long horizontal cuts, one on each side, dividing the tenderloin in thirds without cutting all the way through. Working with one tenderloin at a time, lay it on a cutting board. Holding the knife blade flat, so it parallel to the board, make a lengthwise cut into the side of the tenderloin one-third of the way down from the top, stopping short of the opposite edge so that the flaps remain attached. Rotate the tenderloin 180°. Still holding the knife parallel to the cutting board, make a lengthwise cut into the side opposite the original cut, starting two-thirds of the way down from the top of the tenderloin and taking care not to cut all the way through. Open up the 2 cuts so you have a large rectangle of meat. Use the heel of your hand to gently flatten the meat to about 1/2 inch thick.   4. Cover each butterflied tenderloin with 2 of the ham slices, then spread 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano over the ham, leaving a 1-inch border. Starting with a long side, roll up each tenderloin so the stuffing is in a spiral pattern; then tie the roasts at 2-inch intervals with kitchen string.   5. Lightly brush the roasts all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil then rub with the reserved herb mixture. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roasts, bending to fit if necessary, and cook, turning often, until the outsides are browned, 3 to 5 minutes total.   6. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast, checking often, until the internal temperature reaches 145°F, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. To serve, remove the string and cut the pork into 1-inch-thick slices.

Double butterfly instructions were clear and easy to follow. Thank you for a memorable Easter dinner!   Anonymous, San Francisco, CA        This was relatively easy, after getting past the anxiety of butterflying each of the loins properly.  It was incredibly delicious.  I am not a big pork fan, and I am a cook who usually doesn't eat what I prepare, but I ate it right along with my family and enjoyed it immensely.  One note, I substituded mozzerella for the parm, which gave the meat a cheesier inside.    , Hoboken, NJ        This was outstanding. It was relatively easy to prepare but looked like I had slaved for hours, which is the kind of meal I like! Everyone enjoyed it and asked for seconds.   Anonymous, Aurora, IL        While the visual impact of prosciutto slices would have been more dynamic...the store only had minced...but the flavor was awsome. The whole family loved it. A keeper!   Wolfer, OR        I've made this a few times and it's delicious! I don't even bother to butterfly the loins I just make a slice through the center, but not all the way through obviously, put the stuff in and then fold the flap back over. It's one of my favorite recipes!   Cassie, NJ                   EATINGWELL EDITORS' PICKS               Quick and Healthy Dinners       Make easy, delicious and healthy meals in 15-30 minutes.

It is identified as 1” to 2” in length and can be a variety of colors, more commonly a golden brown.    Like the date, there are several different varieties of figs depending upon the region in which they are grown. When ripe they have a texture similar to a peach, but should be firm, not soft or mushy. In the Middle East one of the most popular recipes for figs is Figs in Syrup, a light desert containing figs drizzled with a sweet syrup.  The fig fruit comes from the fig tree popularly known as the Common Fig. When ripe, the fig fruit is harvested and can be eaten both fresh and dry. Although figs have gained a reputation from the popular cookie, Fig Newtons, fresh figs have an altogether different taste, similar to a strawberry and peach. For those that are health conscious, figs contain more fiber than any other fruit or vegetable, as well as antioxidants.  Figs can sometimes be difficult to find, but they are definitely worth looking for. Most likely they will be found in the produce section of grocery stores, or dried in the baking section. In the U.S. fig season is usually around July and August and lasts only a few months. Dried figs can be found all year long. When purchasing fresh figs, look for fruit that is slightly soft. Fresh figs are highly perishable so purchase only if they will be used within a day or two. Check the fruit to make sure they are not bruised and have a deep, rich color. To store fresh figs, keep in the refrigerator, covered or wrapped. Again, fresh figs will only last a couple of days at most so use as soon as possible.  Dried figs, on the other hand, will last several months when stored wrapped in the refrigerator or a cool, dry place away from light. To prepare, wash fresh figs thoroughly and remove its stem. Dried figs can be used or eaten immediately as is.            Related Articles Fig Varieties. Choosing the right variety for your recipe. Fig Selection and Storage Information.

God does not heal the sick without the aid of the means of healing which lie within the reach of man; or when men refuse to be benefited by the simple remedies that God has provided in pure air and water. When the Lord told Hezekiah that He would spare his life for fifteen years, and as a sign that He would fulfill His promise, caused the sun to go back ten degrees, why did He not put His direct, restoring power upon the King? He told him to apply a bunch of figs to His sore, and that natural remedy, blessed by God, healed him. The God of nature directs the human agent to use natural remedies now.” -   2 SM 286-7         INTERNAL   Fig Juice   made from soaked figs aids:  Sore Throat  Cough  Digestive Ulcers  As a laxative         EXTERNAL   As a poultice:  Split open fig and soak in warm water.   Use on:   Inflamed boil  Gum and teeth abscess  Pain  Scar Tissues     Place thin layer of gauze over affected area then apply fig poultice. Change every eight hours or twice daily.                                                                                 Amazing Health © Copyright 2007.             "

Pat tenderloins dry and dredge in spice mixture until evenly coated.                                                                       Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but  not smoking. Reduce heat to moderate and cook pork, turning occasionally, until meat is browned on all sides and thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each tenderloin registers  145°F, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pork with tongs to a cutting board (reserve skillet) and let stand 10 minutes.                                                                       While pork stands, pour off and discard any fat from skillet, then add pomegranate juice to skillet and boil over moderately high heat until reduced to about 2/3 cup, about 3 minutes (if side of skillet begins to scorch, reduce heat to moderate). Stir together cornstarch and water and whisk into juice, then boil sauce until thickened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.                                                                       Remove from heat and add Sherry vinegar to taste, then swirl in butter until incorporated. Pour sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and skim off  any fat. Season with salt. Slice pork and serve with sauce.                                       add your own note                                                     see all 55 reviews & comments  ›              write your

                           Figs, one of mankind’s oldest fruits, is only now receiving its due attention in homes across the United States. Although considered a fruit, the fig is actually a flower inverted into itself. They are the only fruit to ripen on the tree. Originally native from Turkey to northern India, the fig fruit spread to many of the Mediterranean countries. The primary producers of dried figs today are the United States, Turkey, Greece, and Spain. This highly nutritious fruit arrived in the United States by Spanish missionaries settling in Southern California in 1759. Fig trees were soon planted throughout the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 One serving of figs is 40 grams, about cup, or about 3 Calimyrna figs or about 4 to 5 Mission figs. Figs are high in fiber, providing 20% of the Daily Value — more dietary fiber per serving than any other common dried or fresh fruit. Varieties There are hundreds of fig varieties but the following are most commonly found in today’s markets. The Calimyrna Fig:  Is known for its nut-like flavor and golden skin. This type is commonly eaten as is.  The Mission Fig:  Was named for the mission fathers who planted the fruit along the California coast. This fig is a deep purple which darkens to a rich black when dried.                                                                                         The Kadota Fig:  Is the American version of the original Italian Dattato fig, that is thick-skinned with a creamy amber color when ripe. Practically seedless, this fig is often canned and dried.  The Brown Turkey Fig:  has copper-colored skin, often with hints of purple, and white flesh that shades to pink in the center. This variety is used exclusively for the fresh fig market. Availability Fresh figs are available July through September. Dried figs are never out of season, and are available all year. You can find them in your favorite grocery store in the produce or dried fruit section.                                                                                         Selection Look for figs that are soft and smell sweet. Handle carefully because their fragile skins bruise easily. Storage Store fully ripened figs in the refrigerator up to 2 days; bring to room temperature before serving. Using Dried Figs As a Replacement For Fat in Your Recipes Dried figs are excellent replacement for fat in baked goods. Just remember when using dried figs to replace shortening or oil in baking do not overmix or overbake. Use only half of the normal amount of shortening, margarine, butter or oil, in a recipe when using dried puree. For instance, if 1 cup of margarine is called for, use only cup. Then use of the fig puree.  Here’s a simple fig puree recipe to include in your baking recipes.

Serve mashed or cubed winter squash or sweet potatoes with some chopped figs. The figs are rich on their own, so skip the butter or margarine.
