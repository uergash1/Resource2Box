Howard 's films are pure entertainment; they are well-crafted efforts, frequently technically challenging from a production standpoint, and aimed at mainstream audiences. Though some of his lesser works have been criticized for possessing formulaic scripts,  Howard 's films approach even hackneyed subjects in fresh ways. Though he does not characterize himself as a risk taker, he loves the challenge of exploring different genres; therefore, his filmography includes B-movie actioners, domestic comedies, fantasies, sci-fi, suspense-thrillers, historical dramas, and big-budget action films.     The son of actors Rance and  Jean Howard , he made his theatrical debut at age two in a Baltimore production of The Seven Year Itch. He made his screen debut at age five in the suspenseful political drama The Journey (1959). The youngster became a hot property after that and appeared in several features, including The Music Man and  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  (both 1962). Through this period his father was a strong ally who kept  Howard  from being exploited by filmmakers. In a November 1996 interview with the Detroit News,  Howard  describes an incident in which he was six years old and during rehearsal could not cry on cue ( Howard  doesn't name the production), causing the director to threaten to flog him. Other children may have been terrified, but  Howard  felt secure because his father was on the set and would protect him. When producer  Sheldon Leonard  approached Rance Howard about casting Ronny (as he was billed during childhood) as Opie, the son of widowed sheriff Andy Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968), the elder  Howard  stipulated that his son be allowed time off for a normal childhood. It was as the mischievous but guileless Opie that Ronny Howard became famous. During the popular show's long run,  Howard  occasionally appeared in other feature films.     While a series' demise often signals the death of a child actor's career, particularly if that child is obviously maturing,  Howard  managed the transition gracefully and continued working steadily. He was cast in a new television series,  The Smith Family , in 1971 and starred opposite  Henry Fonda , who became one of  Howard 's mentors, encouraging  Howard  to strive for creative growth and to take periodic risks to keep himself vital. The series lasted one season, but again  Howard  landed on his feet, making a bigger name for himself starring as a callow youth in  George Lucas ' smash hit  American Graffiti  (1973). The film spawned Garry Marshall's long-running hit, the '50s revival sitcom Happy Days (1974). Essentially reprising his role from the film,  Howard  (now billed as Ron Howard) starred as all-American youth Richie Cunningham. Again,  Howard  also worked simultaneously in films, notably in  The Shootist  (1976), where he played a teen who worshipped dying gunslinger  John Wayne .     Though playing a teenager on the series,  Howard  was in his early twenties and felt it was time to follow his longtime dream of becoming a director. Producer  Roger Corman , who had recently starred  Howard  in  Eat My Dust!  (1976), let  Howard  helm the similarly themed  Grand Theft Auto  (1977).  Howard  also co-wrote the screenplay with his father and starred in the film. While not exactly an original masterpiece, the film earned praise for its fast-paced, high-energy action scenes. After leaving Happy Days in 1980, he directed  Bette Davis  in a television movie, Skyward, and managed to earn the great lady's respect with his filmmaking skills.  Howard  had his first big hit in 1982 with the black comedy Nightshift. It was to be the first of many instances in which he would work with producer  Brian Grazer , who eventually became his partner and the co-founder of  Howard 's production company, Imagine Films Entertainment (established in 1985), and screenwriters  Lowell Ganz  and  Babaloo Mandel , who formerly wrote for Happy Days.     Howard  had even greater success with the  Tom Hanks / Darryl Hannah  vehicle  Splash  (1984), which launched Disney's Touchstone Pictures and became the company's most successful live-action film to date. He followed this up with sentimental favorite  Cocoon  (1985). Earlier that year  Howard  starred in an immensely popular television reunion movie, Back to Mayberry. He had his first misstep after hitting it big with Willow, a  George Lucas -produced fantasy extravaganza that never clicked with audiences, though it has since developed a devoted cult following. During the early '90s,  Howard  went into a slump when a series of big-budget films such as  Backdraft  (1991) and  Far and Away  (1992) did relatively poorly with critics and viewers, but came back strongly with  Apollo 13  (1995), a gripping account of a failed moon mission. A masterful blend of special effects wizardry (it contains the most realistic views of weightlessness on film), science, and human interest,  Apollo 13  was a huge international hit, nominated for nine Oscars (it won for Best Sound and Best Editing), and earned  Howard  the coveted Director's Guild Association Outstanding Feature Film Directorial Achievement Award, which puts him in league with such directors as  John Ford ,  Billy Wilder ,  George Cukor , and  Francis Ford Coppola .     In 1996,  Howard  attempted a new genre with the violent, bloody thriller  Ransom , starring  Mel Gibson . While an effective suspense thriller in it's own right,  Ransom  didn't darken  Howard 's sensibilities in any permanent terms, and after a few stints as producer on both the small screen (Felicity, Sports Night and the silver screen (Inventing the Abbots (1997) and Beyond the Mat (1999)),  Howard  was back in the director's chair for Ed TV in 1999. Though it was warmly recieved by critics and gained generally positive notice from those who saw it, Ed TV suffered immediate and fatal comparisons to the more popular and strikingly similar Jim Carrey vehicle, The Truman Show. Undaunted,  Howard  next teamed with the rubber-faced star of Truman for an imaginative and visually dazzling live-action adaptation of Theodore Geisel's animated Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. With it's elaborate sets and costumes, as well as Carrey's giddy performance as the grumpy green Grinch, many found the film an overblown expansion of the beloved children's classic (though many were quick to single-out Carrey's energetic portrayal of the Grinch as a entertainingly distracting highlight).   Once again turning back to reality after the marked departure of The Grinch,  Howard  helmed the sensitive real-life tale of paranoid schizophrenic mathematician turned Nobel Prize winnig genius John Forbes Nash Jr. in A Beautiful Mind (2001). With Russel Crowe essaying the role of Nash and  Jennifer Connelly  as his faithful and enduring wife, the film gained generally positive reception upon release, and only seemed to cement  Howard 's reputation as one of the most versatile and gifted director's of his generation as the filmt took the Best Picture award at both the that year's Golden Globes and Oscars. Academy Award night proved to be an even bigger night for  Howard  as the film also took home awards for Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and, of course, Best Director.     Howard  followed up his Oscar wins with the dark Western drama The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett. Unfortunately, neither critics or audiences were too fond of the over-long film. Lucky for  Howard , his next project would see him re-team with A Beautiful Mind's Russell Crowe. The Depression-era boxing film Cinderella Man starred Crowe as real-life boxer Jim Braddock and was released in 2005 to positive reviews and Oscar-buzz.    When not working,  Howard  spends time at his Connecticut home with his wife, former high school sweetheart Cheryl, and their four children -- three of whom were named after the places in which they were conceived. Neither he nor his wife will permit the kids to become actors until they are fully grown. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide                                                                                                         Movie data provided by                                                                                            © 2007 Getty Images                                                     Add this Person to Favorites                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Need Help?

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon ,  The Da Vinci Code , and its upcoming sequel,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.   Ron Howard recently made a cameo appearance in the 2009 music video for fellow Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx's song ""Blame It"" along side Academy Award winner Forrest Whittaker, Academy Award nominee, Jake Gyllenhaal and Samuel L. Jackson. In the video he is shown holding a glass of champagne.

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Soundtrack   The film features an end credits song, Winter Light, performed by  Linda Ronstadt , based on two themes from the score by  Zbigniew Preisner . However, the song is not featured in the film's original soundtrack, but in Ronstadt's eponymous album  Winter Light .   The soundtrack, released by  Varese Sarabande , contains the original score.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.       [ edit ]   Response     [ edit ]   Critical Reception   Since its 1993 release, the film has garnered exceptionally positive reviews and currently garners a rare 100% ""fresh"" approval rating on the  Rotten Tomatoes  website.

I absolutely loved this film when I was younger, and it's still in my video collection.  Based around a girl called Mary Lennox, who after growing up in India with her parents and losing them in an earthquake, is sent to live with her reclusive uncle in England. After a brief meeting with her Uncle, who is still mourning the loss of his wife 10 years previous, Mary is left to her own accord to wander the gardens and do as she pleases. She finds a key and the most magical secret garden, and with the help of a friendly robin and one of the servants brothers, Dickon, they restore it and learn the secrets of the manor along the way.  It's a great film, and Kate Maberly plays Mary brilliantly, starting off as a bitter selfish girl, who hasn't ever dressed herself, to a young girl capable of loving once again. It's a great family, feel good film, set in the English countryside! emza2511's review and ratings    | 179 words                                         Del.icio.us   Furl   Magnolia   My Yahoo   Digg   Google   StumbleUpon   Facebook Tell a Friend   The Secret Garden Web Sites       Who Wrote the Secret Garden When Was the Secret Garden Written Secret Garden Book Summary of the Secret Garden Characters in Secret Garden Secret Garden Lyrics Secret Garden Movie Film Location for the Secret Garden Author of Secret Garden The Secret Garden Leyburn A Biography of Frances Hodgson Burnett Kate Maberly Now Lepidocybium Forbidden Corner MRs Henry Wood Amazon Ergot Fungus Latin Phrases Arctocephalinae Interflora Frances Hodgson Burnett Tom Jones         Search for:        this topic             Top Childrens Films Bedknobs And Broomsticks Cool Runnings Finding Nemo (U) Goodnight Mister Tom Holes The Incredibles (U) Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Special Edition) Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory Winnie The Pooh - The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh Wizard Of Oz (U) Requested reviews 100 Favourite Nursery Rhymes And Songs Basil The Great Mouse Detective Cinderella Special Edition Hercules Jungle Book 2 (U) Pollyanna Stingray - Complete Series The Hunchback Of Notre Dame The Rescuers Down Under Treasure Planet   Would you like to see a review that's not being listed?

Learn how to watch your favorite TV shows and movies online for free!     The cost of entertainment can be expensive. Luckily, there are websites that allow users to watch TV shows and movies at no cost from your own computer. With no cost to you and just a few minutes of brief advertisements, you can catch up on missed episodes of your favorite shows, relive old memories with television classics and even watch a blockbuster or two.   Online Television    Watching television and movies online is not only free--it is also legal. According to Gregory Karp of the Chicago Tribune in his article  ""Watching TV Solely on Computers is Possible,""  ""Full-length TV shows are available on the Internet, supported by short commercials"" [January 5, 2009].   Online movies and television is available through many websites including:   Television Networks : Find your favorite show's website and they might just have a free episode or two online. Aggregated Websites : A collection of TV shows and older movies sponsored by advertisers. You get the shows for free, but interspersed with ads for products. Some of these websites include:  Hulu.com  and Joost.com. Freebies on Pay Sites:  Many websites offer TV shows and movies for download such as Netflix and Itunes, but sometimes, sites, such as Itunes, offer free or low cost previews, clips or even entire shows Youtube:  Youtube.com and other sites like it offer free clips and samples of movie trailers and shows. Playing TV and Movies on Your Computer   Once you have found a TV show or movie you want to watch you can view it on your computer through your computers media player. If you do not have the necessary software installed on your computer, don't worry! The website will usually direct you to a page where you can download the correct plug-in or software to play media on the Internet.   Pros and Cons of Free TV and Movies Online   Viewing free TV shows and movies online legally on your computer seems like a great alternative to paying for cable or downloading shows from paid sites. But, before you cancel that cable subscription package there are some pros and cons to consider:   Pros   Convenience: You can view the shows you want when you want. Streamline Viewing: Access only the TV shows and movies you are interested in viewing and leave the rest. Don't Miss Out: You can rewind, pause and restart as much as you need to - unlike watching a show on cable. It is free and legal: If you had been tempted to download a show through other means - these options might just change your mind! Cons   Online isn't everything: Not everything can be found online. Also, as Karp notes in his Tribune article, there are often delays with networks loading shows onto the air or even deleting shows from their servers. You may not be able to enjoy a show again and again. If you didn't get to finish watching it and it was removed from the server - you can't catch the rerun! Picture and sound quality: Unless you've done a lot of tweaking to set your computer up only to watch free online TV shows and movies your computer is also doing a lot of other things besides buffering your shows! Slowdowns, delays, sound quality and the like may all interfere with the viewing experience. Watching TV Shows and Movies Online is Here to Stay   Even with the cons of online television and movie viewing - new ways to legally access free shows are created everyday! It may be worth a couple of days delay and a few sound bite issues to see episodes of your favorite TV shows and old movies. At no cost to you - why not ""see"" what all the fuss is about?

IMDb       On the Waterfront  is a  1954   American   drama film  about mob violence and corruption among  longshoremen . The film was directed by  Elia Kazan  and written by  Budd Schulberg . It stars  Marlon Brando ,  Eva Marie Saint ,  Rod Steiger ,  Karl Malden  and  Lee J. Cobb . The soundtrack score was composed by  Leonard Bernstein . It was based on a series of articles written in the  New York Sun  by  Malcolm Johnson .   The film received eight  Academy Awards , including  Best Picture ,  Best Actor , and  Best Director . It is  Leonard Bernstein 's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with musical songs.   On the Waterfront  has often been cited as an allegory of ""naming names"" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s.

This classic story of Mob informers was based on a number of true stories and filmed on location in and around the docks of  Hoboken ,  New Jersey . Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders, but witnesses play deaf and dumb (""D&D""). Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a dockworker whose brother Charley (Rod Steiger) is Friendlys lawyer. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly had Charley instruct Terry to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting on the weaker opponent. As the film begins, Terry sees boss Friendly's men kill another dockworker to keep him from testifying against Friendly before the crime commission, and Terry resents having been tricked into helping to set up the murder. At first Terry is willing to remain D&D. The dead dockworker's lovely sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint) shames ""waterfront priest"" Father Barry (Karl Malden) into fighting against the union/mob. Soon both Edie and Father Barry are urging Terry to testify. Another dockworker does testify, and Friendly arranges for him to have a fatal accident.   As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can bribe, or threaten, him to keep quiet. Charley tries, but fails. In one of the most famous scenes in movie history, Terry reminds Charley that if it had not been for the fixing of the fight, ""I coulda been a contender"". Charley gives Terry a gun and tells him to run. Friendly finds out, and has his goons murder Charley, and try to kill Terry. Terry tries to find, and shoot, Friendly, but Father Barry obstructs that course of action and finally convinces Terry to fight Friendly by testifying. In a final face-to-face confrontation with Friendly, Terry gets beaten up, but the dockworkers fall in behind Terry, sensing that he has defeated Friendly.     [ edit ]   Factual background   On the Waterfront  was based on a 24-part series of articles in the  New York Sun  by  Malcolm Johnson , ""Crime on the Waterfront"". The series won the 1949  Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting . The stories detailed widespread  corruption, extortion, and racketeering  on the waterfront of Manhattan and Brooklyn.   To add realism,  On the Waterfront  was filmed over 36 days on-location in  Hoboken, New Jersey  (in the cargo holds of ships, workers' slum dwellings, the bars, the littered alleys, and on the rooftops). And some of the labor boss' chief bodyguards/goons in the film (Abe Simon as Barney, Tony Galento as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tullio) were real-life, professional ex-heavyweight boxers.          Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy and Eva Marie Saint as Edie Doyle in the film's trailer.       In  On the Waterfront , protagonist Terry Malloy's (Brando's) fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DiVincenzo, who testified before a real-life  Waterfront Commission  on the facts of life on the Hoboken docks and had suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DiVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with  Columbia Pictures  over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DiVincenzo recounted his story to screenwiter  Budd Schulberg  during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings  which some claim never occurred  even though Shulberg attended Di Vincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing. Johnny Friendly was based in part on mobster  Albert Anastasia , chief executioner of  Murder, Inc.  as well as  Michael Clemente , the  International Longshoremen's Association  boss. [ citation needed ]   Karl Malden's character of Father Barry was based on the real-life ""waterfront priest"" Father  John M. Corridan , a graduate of  Regis High School  who operated a  Roman Catholic  labor school on the  west side of Manhattan . Father Corridan was extensively interviewed by Budd Schulberg, who wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan,  Waterfront Priest  by Allen Raymond. The story was filmed in Hoboken, New Jersey, although it is a fictionalized version of events on the New York waterfront.     [ edit ]   Schulberg's later novel   Budd Schulberg later published a novel just called  Waterfront  that was much closer to his original screenplay than what finally ended up on the screen. Among several differences is that in Schulberg's novel and original screen treatment, Terry Malloy dies.     [ edit ]   Political context          Karl Malden as Father Barry with Eva Marie Saint.       In 1952, director Elia Kazan was a ""friendly"" witness before the  House Un-American Activities Committee  (HUAC), in which he identified many alleged Communists in the film industry. That brought him severe criticism. [ 1 ]  Being ""friendly"" before the HUAC could be a possible clue towards the name of the mob boss in the movie, Johnny Friendly.   The original screenplay (called ""The Hook"") was written by renowned playwright  Arthur Miller , who was blacklisted as an alleged Communist. He was replaced by  Budd Schulberg , also a ""friendly"" witness before HUAC. [ 2 ]   On the Waterfront , being about a heroic mob informer, is widely considered to be Kazan's answer to his critics (including his former friend and collaborator Miller), showing that there could be nobility in a man who ""named names."" In the movie, variations of that phrase are repeatedly used by Terry Malloy. The film also repeatedly emphasizes the waterfront's code of ""D and D"" or ""Deaf and Dumb,"" remaining silent at all costs and not ""ratting out"" one's friends. In the end, Malloy does just that and his doing so is depicted sympathetically. Miller's response to the movie's message is contained in his own play,  A View from the Bridge , which presents a contrasting view of those who inform on others.     [ edit ]   Awards and honors   In 1989, this film was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the  Library of Congress  and selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry . It is also on the  Vatican 's list of 45 greatest films of all time, compiled in 1995 [ 3 ] .

Premiered:  September 19, 1994 When is it on?:  Thursdays at 10pm ET on NBC (Check local listings). The show can also be found in syndication on numerous channels. Starring:  Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver   Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kovac    Maura Tierney as Dr. Abby Lockhart    Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Gregory Pratt    Parminder Nagra as Dr. Neela Rasgotra    Linda Cardellini as Nurse Samantha Taggart    Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris    Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett Big Names on the Small Screen:  Several big names have gone through that emergency room, including: George Clooney, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Julianna Margulies, Noah Wyle, CCH Pounder, Anthony Edwards, Ray Liotta, Red Buttons and Sally Field to name a few. Trivia Fact #1:  The basketball net you see outside of the ER is used by many of the actors to help unwind during/after shooting. Trivia Fact #2:  Noah Wylie and his character, John Carter both share the same birthday: June 4th. Trivia Fact #3:  The show does most of the filming in Los Angeles, but twice a year, they do on-location filming in Chicago. Trivia Fact #4:  The character of Carol Hathaway, played by Julianna Margulies was supposed to become brain-dead after a suicide attempt, but the writers decided to make her a series regular. Rae's Take:  After ten years, I still find ""ER"" as refreshing as the first season. The constant turnover of characters keeps viewers on their toes. Plane crashes, gunfire, romantic interludes, and challenging medical cases keeps the element of surprise alive and well. I don't see why this series won't last another few years before audiences completely tune out. “ER” is still Tivo-worthy after all these years. Synopsis:   ""ER""  tracks the inner workings of County General Hospital, a Level One Trauma Center where heroic doctors and nurses are faced with life-and-death decisions on a daily basis. The chief of staff, Dr. Kerry Weaver (Innes), a tough and determined administrator, finds herself at a personal crossroads, trying to strike a balance between her life as a doctor and the life she now wants as a woman.      Also on staff are Dr. Luka Kovac (Visnjic), an ER attending physician from Croatia who is searching – sometimes self-destructively – for something to fill the void of his lost family and failed relationships; Abby Lockhart (Tierney), who recently made the professional transition from nurse to doctor, is making a serious effort to turn her personal life around and Dr. Gregory Pratt (Phifer), a brash, third-year resident with a checkered background that won’t stop haunting him.      Recent additions to the ER include Neela Rasgotra (Nagra), a British-Indian medical student who arrives in Chicago after finishing her undergraduate degree in biophysics and molecular biology at Yale. Samantha Taggart (Cardellini) is a nurse and spirited single mother determined to save lives in a place where nothing is taken for granted.      Dr. Ray Barnett (West) has come aboard as a doctor who would sometimes rather be playing in his band than treating patients. He has a way with the ladies and a knack for making things go smoothly, most of the time.      Summary provided by   NBC Universal .
