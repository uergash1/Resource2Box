Win Cash Prizes in Online Poker Tournaments The bankroll tournament is a National League of Poker favorite. The prizes offered by bankroll tournaments are cash. The value of the cash prize offered will vary by tournament, but typical values for daily bankroll tournaments are $5, $10, $25 and $50. These tournaments start daily on the half hour. If you are interested in larger bankroll tournaments, keep your eyes open for our special bankroll promotions.  In 2006, we gave out $250,000 in prizes! The third type of online poker tournament that you can enter is the qualifying tournament. These tournaments are used to qualify players for great prizes and larger tournaments. Some of the daily qualifying tournaments include the hat qualifier, keychain qualifier, table qualifier and Rayban qualifier.

clueweb09-en0006-14-04998	     Casino100.Net - Casino euro online casino                                                 Casino Euro  is an online casino which uses software from Net Entertainment, a Swedish-based software developer that is traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The site has a good credibility and reputation. Unfortunately, US citizens are not allowed to play on the site except perhaps in free games, but this is no real loss. The site provides a thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience even without the real money bets.                     Layouts, Games and Plays          One of the nice things about  Casino Euro  is its o downloadfeature your actual choice is between playing for real (in which case, registration and an initial deposit is required) or for practice, in which case a single click brings you to the free-games lobby.         The o downloadfeature is fast and quick to load using a broadband connection brings you to the game lobby in the blink of an eye. Selecting a game is just as easy, although the download takes a few seconds. Some players, using a dialup connection, still report quick and easy uploads of games.         Casino Euro  layout is clean and very subdued ool colorspredominate especially at card table games. However even the slots and video poker games show the same uncluttered and clean layouts which is a refreshing change from many online casinos whose idea of games border on the garish and gaudy.         In a way,  Casino Euro  appears to take on the ambience of European (or ld World casinos subdued, elegant and refined. The games move quickly and payouts are excellent whether on the card or table games (blackjack or roulette) or even on the slots and video poker games.         The downside is that there are only a few available slot and video poker games. Although the regular games are available (Deuces Wild, Jacks or Better and so on), the choice remains limited when compared to others.                 Bonuses, Promotions and Cashouts           Casino Euro  offers a signup bonus of up to 111 Euros actually 50 percent of your initial deposit amount. Note that  Casino Euro  games are all in Euros; somewhat confusing if youe not used to the exchange rate. After the first month, subsequent deposits will be matched up to 30 percent of your deposit in other words, a 100 Euro deposit gives you 130 Euros to play with.         Casino Euro  also offers urprisebonuses to random players on an infrequent basis, as well as offering bonuses (under specific terms and conditions) for players who refer a friend to the site. There are also monthly promotional activities that can earn further bonus points.         Deposit options are rather limited, though. Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard and Diners, Neteller and Moneybookers are your options. Withdrawals or cashouts are instantaneous although the actual processing time varies with the payment method employed.

clueweb09-enwp02-22-11709	"                     Texas hold 'em          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Texas hold'em poker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the popular poker variant.  For the Xbox Live Arcade game, see  Texas Hold 'em (video game) .          Texas hold 'em involves community cards available to all players (pictured here on the left).       Texas hold 'em  (also  hold'em ,  holdem ) is the most popular  poker  game in the casinos and poker card rooms across North America and Europe, as well as  online . According to  Doyle Brunson  and  Johnny Moss , it was originally considered a variation of seven card stud, and was called ""Texas hold 'em seven card stud"" back in the 1920's. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  Hold 'em is a  community card  game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two  hole cards  to make a poker hand, in contrast to  poker variants  like  stud  or  draw  where each player holds a separate individual hand.   After slow but steady gains in popularity throughout the 20th century, hold 'em's popularity surged in the 2000s due to exposure on television, on the Internet and in popular literature. During this time hold 'em replaced  7 card stud  as the most common game in U.S. casinos, almost totally eclipsing the once popular game. [ 3 ]  The  no-limit betting  form is used in the widely televised main event of the  World Series of Poker  (WSOP) and the  World Poker Tour  (WPT).   Because each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, it is an excellent game for  strategic analysis  (including  mathematical analysis ). Hold 'em's simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books which provide recommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing relatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays. [ 4 ]           Contents       1   Objective   2   History   3   The hold 'em explosion     3.1   Television and film   3.2   Literature   3.3   Online poker       4   Rules     4.1   Betting structures   4.2   Play of the hand   4.3   The showdown       5   Examples     5.1   Sample showdown   5.2   Sample hand   5.3   Kickers and ties       6   Strategy     6.1   Starting hands   6.2   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures     6.2.1   Cash games   6.2.2   Tournaments           7   Similar games   8   References               [ edit ]   Objective   In Texas hold 'em, like all  variants of poker , individuals compete for an amount of money contributed by the players themselves (called the  pot ). Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.   The game is divided into a series of hands or deals; at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between more than one player is discussed below). A hand may end at  the showdown , in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a  tie . The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand is when all but one player have  folded  and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.   The objective of winning players is not winning every  individual  hand, but rather making mathematically correct decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. By making such decisions, winning poker players maximize long-term winnings by maximizing their  expected utility  on each round of betting. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Johnny Moss, Chill Wills, Amarillo Slim, Jack Binion, and Puggy Pearson outside of Binion's Horseshoe in 1974       Although little is known about the invention of Texas hold 'em, the  Texas State Legislature  officially recognizes  Robstown, Texas  as the game's birthplace, dating the game to the early 1900s. [ 6 ]   After its invention and spread throughout  Texas , hold 'em was introduced to  Las Vegas  in 1967 by a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including  Crandell Addington ,  Doyle Brunson , and  Amarillo Slim . [ 7 ]  Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. ""They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em... I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game.  Draw poker , you only bet twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game."" [ 8 ]   For several years the  Golden Nugget Casino  in  Downtown Las Vegas  was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was ""truly a ' sawdust  joint,' with... oiled sawdust covering the floors."" [ 9 ]  Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of the now-demolished  Dunes Casino  on the  Las Vegas Strip . This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players. [ 9 ]   After a disappointing attempt to establish a ""Gambling Fraternity Convention"", Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games including Texas hold 'em. In 1970  Benny  and  Jack Binion  acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the  World Series of Poker , and moved it to their casino  Binion's Horseshoe Casino  in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be  no-limit  Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event. [ 9 ]  Interest in the Main Event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only 8 entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over 100 entrants in 1982, and over 200 in 1991. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   During this time, Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide,  Super/System  was first published. [ 13 ]  Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold 'em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. [ 14 ]  A few years later,  Al Alvarez  published a book detailing an early  World Series of Poker  event. [ 15 ]  The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the  World Series of Poker . It is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and poker generally), for the first time, to a wider audience. [ 16 ]   Interest in hold 'em outside of  Nevada  began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although  California  had legal card rooms offering  draw poker , Texas hold 'em was prohibited under a statute which made illegal the now unknown game ""stud-horse"". However in 1988, Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from ""stud-horse"" in  Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp , 271 Cal. Rptr. 792 (1990). Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [ 17 ]  (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a skill game, [ 18 ]  but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker. [ 19 ] ) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers  Terry Rogers  and  Liam Flood  introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   The hold 'em explosion   In the first decade of the 21st century, Texas hold 'em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide. [ 3 ]  Many observers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of  online poker , the game's appearance in film and on television, the  2004-05 NHL lockout , [ 21 ]  the appearance of television commercials advertising online cardrooms, and the  2003 World Series of Poker  championship victory by online qualifier  Chris Moneymaker . [ 22 ]           Joe Hachem , winner of  2005 World Series of Poker  main event         [ edit ]   Television and film       Main article:  Poker on television       Prior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie  Rounders  (1998), starring  Matt Damon  and  Edward Norton , gave moviegoers a romantic view of the game as a way of life. Texas hold 'em was the main game played during the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following  Doyle Brunson , as the ""Cadillac of Poker"". A clip of the classic showdown between  Johnny Chan  and  Erik Seidel  from the  1988 World Series of Poker  was also incorporated into the film. [ 23 ]  More recently, a high-stakes Texas Hold'em game was central to the plot of the 2006  James Bond  film  Casino Royale , in place of  baccarat  which was originally the casino game central to the story in the novel from which the film was based.   Hold 'em tournaments had been televised since the late 1970's, but they did not become popular until 1999, when hidden  lipstick cameras  were first used to show players' private hole cards on the  Late Night Poker  TV show in the United Kingdom. [ 24 ]  Hold 'em exploded in popularity as a spectator sport in the United States and Canada in early 2003, when the World Poker Tour adopted the  lipstick cameras  idea. A few months later,  ESPN 's coverage of the  2003 World Series of Poker  featured the unexpected victory of  Internet  player  Chris Moneymaker , an amateur player who gained admission to the tournament by winning a series of online tournaments. Moneymaker's victory initiated a sudden surge of interest in the World Series, based on the  egalitarian  idea that anyone  even a rank novice  can become a world champion. [ 25 ]   In 2003, there were 839 entrants in the WSOP Main Event, [ 26 ]  and triple that number in 2004. [ 27 ]  The crowning of the  2004 WSOP  champion,  Greg ""Fossilman"" Raymer , a  patent attorney  from Connecticut, further fueled the popularity of the event among amateur (and particularly internet) players. [ 28 ]  In the  2005 Main Event , an unprecedented 5,619 entrants vied for a first prize of $7,500,000. The winner,  Joe Hachem  of Australia, was a semi-professional player. [ 29 ]  This growth continued in 2006, with 8,773 entrants and a first place prize of $12,000,000 (won by  Jamie Gold ). [ 30 ]   Beyond the World Series, other television shows  including the long running  World Poker Tour   are credited with increasing the popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 31 ]  In addition to its presence on network and general audience cable television, [ 32 ]  poker has now become a regular part of sports networks' programming in the United States. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Twenty years after the publication of Alvarez's groundbreaking book,  James McManus  published a semi-autobiographical book,  Positively Fifth Street  (2003), which simultaneously describes the trial surrounding the murder of  Ted Binion  and McManus' own entry into the  2000 World Series of Poker . [ 34 ]  McManus, a poker amateur, finished 5th in the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em main event, winning over $200,000. [ 35 ]  In the book McManus discusses events surrounding the World Series, the trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, poker strategy, and some history of poker and the world series.   Michael Craig 's 2005 book  The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King  details a series of high stakes Texas hold 'em one-on-one games between  Texas   banker   Andy Beal  and a rotating group of poker professionals. As of 2006, these games were the highest stakes ever played, reaching $100,000$200,000  fixed limit . [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Online poker          Poker revenues from  Party Gaming  (2002-2006). The drop off in 2006 is due to the  UIGEA .           Main article:  Online poker       The ability to play cheaply and anonymously online has been credited as a cause of the increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 25 ]  Online poker sites both allow people to try out games and also provide an avenue for entry into large tournaments (like the World Series of Poker) via smaller tournaments known as satellites. Both the 2003 and 2004 winners of the World Series qualified by playing in these tournaments. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   Although online poker grew from its inception in 1998 until 2003, Moneymaker's win and the appearance of televisions advertisements in 2003 contributed to a tripling of industry revenues in 2004. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Rules     The descriptions below assume a familiarity with the general  game play of poker , and with  poker hands . For a general introduction to these topics, see  poker ,  poker hands ,  poker probability , and  poker jargon .       [ edit ]   Betting structures     See the article on  betting  for a detailed explanation of betting in these variations of hold 'em.            A standard hold 'em game showing the position of the blinds relative to the dealer button       Hold 'em is normally played using small and big  blind bets   forced bets by two players.  Antes  (forced contributions by all players) may be used in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of  tournament play . A  dealer button  is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The  small blind  is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The  big blind , posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In  tournament poker , the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. (In some cases, the small blind is some other fraction of a small bet, e.g. $10 is a common small blind when the big blind is $15. The  double-blind  structure described above is a commonly used and more recent adoption.)   When only two players remain, special 'head-to-head' or 'heads up' rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while his/her opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the  flop . After the flop, the dealer acts last and remains this way for the remainder of the hand.   The three most common variations of hold 'em are  limit  hold 'em,  no-limit  hold 'em and  pot-limit  hold 'em. Limit hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em found in casino  live action  games in the United States. [ 3 ]  In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and  flop ) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the  small bet . In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the  big bet . No-limit hold 'em is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the  World Series of Poker . In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an  all-in  bet). The minimum raise is equal to the big blind. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a bet of $6 to a total of $8, a raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise, the initial raiser can not re-raise again. This only matters of course if there was a call before the re-raise. In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).   Most casinos that offer hold 'em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional  live straddle , usually double the amount of the big blind, which then acts as the big blind. No-limit games may also allow multiple re-straddles, in any amount that would be a legal raise. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Play of the hand          Each player is dealt two private cards in hold 'em. They are dealt first.       Play begins with each player being dealt two  cards  face down, with the player in the small blind receiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving the last card dealt. (Like most poker games, the deck is a standard 52-card deck, no jokers.) These cards are the player's  hole  or  pocket cards . These are the only cards each player will receive individually, and they will only (possibly) be revealed at the  showdown , making Texas hold 'em a  closed  poker game.   The hand begins with a ""pre-flop"" betting round, beginning with the player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the dealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing  clockwise . A round of betting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their chips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See  betting  for a detailed account. Note that the blinds are considered ""live"" in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they contribute to the amount that the blind player must contribute, and that, if all players call around to the player in the big blind position, that player may either check or raise.   After the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand, the dealer deals a  flop , three face-up  community cards . The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise.   After the flop betting round ends, a single community card (called the  turn  or fourth street) is dealt, followed by a third betting round. A final single community card (called the  river  or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary.   In all casinos, the dealer will  burn  a card before the flop, turn, and river. Because of this burn, players who are betting cannot see the back of the next community card to come, which might be marked. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   The showdown   If a player bets and all other players fold, then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show his hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a  showdown  occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best five-card  poker hand  he can make from the seven cards comprising his two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of his own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form his final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be  playing the board  and can only hope to  split  the pot, since each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand. [ 13 ]   If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order. It is common for players to have closely-valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as  two pair  or  three of a kind ), then  kickers  are used to settle ties (see the second example below). Note that the card's  numerical  rank is of sole importance;  suit values  are irrelevant in Hold'em.     [ edit ]   Examples     [ edit ]   Sample showdown   Here's a sample showdown:       Board           Bob              Carol              Ted              Alice                Each player plays the best 5-card hand they can make with the seven cards available. They have       Bob     Three fours, with ace, king kicker       Carol     Ace-high flush       Ted     Full house, kings full of fours       Alice     8-high straight       In this case, Ted's full house is the best hand, with Carol in 2nd, Alice in 3rd and Bob last.     [ edit ]   Sample hand          The blinds for this example hand       Here is a sample game involving four players. The players' individual hands will not be revealed until the showdown, to give a better sense of what happens during play:   Compulsory bets:  Alice is the dealer. Bob, to Alice's left, posts a small blind of $1, and Carol posts a big blind of $2.   Pre-flop:  Alice deals two hole cards face down to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Ted must act first because he is the first player after the big blind. He cannot  check , since the $2 big blind plays as a bet, so he folds. Alice  calls  the $2. Bob adds an additional $1 to his $1 small blind to call the $2 total. Carol's blind is ""live"" (see  blind ), so she has the  option  to raise here, but she checks instead, ending the first betting round. The pot now contains $6, $2 from each of three players.   Flop:  Alice now burns a card and deals the flop of three face-up community cards,  9   K   3 . On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the player on the dealer's left begins the betting. In this case it is Bob, who checks. Carol opens for $2, Ted has already folded and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. He calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol's initial bet and $2 to match Alice's raise). Carol calls as well, putting in her $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.   Turn:  Alice now burns another card and deals the turn card face up. It is the  5 . Bob checks, Carol checks, and Alice checks; the turn has been  checked around . The pot still contains $18.   River:  Alice burns another card and deals the final river card, the  9 , making the final board  9   K   3   5   9 . Bob bets $4, Carol calls, and Alice folds (Alice's holding was  A   7 ; she was hoping the river card would be a club to make her hand a  flush ).   Showdown:  Bob shows his hand of  Q   9 , so the best five-card hand he can make is  9   9   9   K   Q , for  three  nines, with a king-queen kicker. Carol shows her cards of  K   J , making her final hand  K   K   9   9   J  for  two pair , kings and nines, with a jack kicker. Bob wins the showdown and the $26 pot.     [ edit ]   Kickers and ties   Because of the presence of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is not uncommon for  kickers  to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) to tie. A kicker is a card which is part of the five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's  rank . For instance, in the hand  A - A - A - K - Q , the king and queen are kickers.   The following situation illustrates the importance of breaking ties with kickers and card ranks, as well as the use of the five-card rule. After the turn, the board and players' hole cards are as follows.       Board (after the turn)           Bob         Carol           At the moment, Bob is in the lead with a hand of  Q   Q   8   8   K , making two pair, queens and eights, with a king kicker. This beats Carol's hand of  Q   Q   8   8   10  by virtue of his king kicker.   Suppose the final card were the  A , making the final board  8   Q   8   4   A . Bob and Carol still each have two pair (Queens and eights), but both of them are now entitled to play the final ace as their fifth card, making their hands both two pair, queens and eights, with an ace kicker. Bob's king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, had the last card been King or lower (except a Queen which would make a full house, or a Ten which would give Carol a higher pair), Bob's King would have stayed in game and he would have won.     [ edit ]   Strategy           Doyle Brunson  is credited with bringing poker strategy to a wider audience         See  Poker strategy  for a more detailed discussion of general poker strategy     Most poker authors recommend a tight- aggressive  approach to playing Texas hold 'em. This strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does play (aggressive). [ 4 ]  Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well. [ 4 ]   Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as  position ) is an important element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em. [ 5 ]  Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.   Because of the game's level of complexity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt to develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold'em tournament as an isolated complex system has had some success, [ 41 ]  although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In addition, groups at the  University of Alberta  and  Carnegie Mellon University  are developing poker playing programs utilizing techniques in  game theory  and  artificial intelligence . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Starting hands       Main article:  Texas hold 'em starting hands              A pair of  aces  is statistically the best hand to be dealt in Texas Hold'em Poker       Because there are only two cards dealt to each player, it is easy to characterize all of the starting hands. There are (52  51)  2 = 1,326 distinct possible  combinations  of two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Because  no suit is more powerful than another , many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy. For example, although  J   J  and  J   J  are distinct combinations of cards, they are of equal value as starting hands.   Viewed this way there are only 169 different hole-card combinations. Thirteen of those hands would be pairs, from 2 through ace. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank (12 possible hands containing an ace, 11 possible hands containing a king and no ace, 10 possible hands containing a queen and no ace or king, etc.). Hole cards can both be used in a  flush  if they are suited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs, and 78 possible unsuited non-pairs, for a total of 169 possible hands. [ 44 ]  Suited starting cards are usually considered stronger than unsuited hands, although the magnitude of this strength in different games is debated. [ 45 ]   Because of this limited number of starting hands, most strategy guides involve a detailed discussion of each of these 169 starting hands. This separates hold 'em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories. Another result of this small number is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual hands. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures   Texas Hold'em is commonly played both as a  ""cash"" or ""ring"" game  and as a  tournament game . Strategy for these different forms varies widely.     [ edit ]   Cash games       Main article:  Ring game       Prior to the invention of  poker tournaments , all poker games were played with real money where players bet actual currency (or chips which represented currency). Games which feature wagering actual money on individual hands are still very common and are referred to as ""cash games"" or ""ring games"".   The  no-limit  and  fixed-limit  cash game versions of hold 'em are strategically very different. Doyle Brunson claims that ""the games are so different that there are  not  many players who rank with the best in both types of hold 'em. Many no-limit players have difficulty  gearing down  for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit."" [ 13 ]  Because the size of bets is restricted in limit games, the ability to  bluff  is somewhat curtailed. Since one is not (usually) risking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances. [ 13 ]   Lower stakes games also exhibit different properties than higher stakes games. Small stakes games often involve more players in each hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and betting) to extremely aggressive (many raises). The difference of small stakes games have resulted in several books dedicated to only those games. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments       Main article:  Poker tournament       Texas hold 'em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the  World Series of Poker 's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. [ 48 ]  Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with  chips  that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to ""buy-in"" a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only a small percentage of the players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. ""The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table"" (usually nine players) ""to get paid for each 100 entrants,"" according to poker expert Andrew N. S. Glazer, in his book,  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker . [ 49 ]  As a result the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.   Proper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one's opponents. [ 4 ]  Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Similar games   There are several other poker variants which resemble Texas hold 'em. Hold 'em is a member of a class of poker games known as  community card games , where some cards are available for use by all the players. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private cards and are thus similar to Texas hold 'em.  Royal hold 'em  has the same structure as Texas hold 'em, but the deck contains only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens. [ 51 ]   Pineapple  and  Omaha hold 'em  both vary the number of cards an individual receives before the flop (along with the rules regarding how they may be used to form a hand), but are dealt identically afterward. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  Alternatively, in  Double-board hold'em  all players receive the same number of private cards, but there are two sets of community cards. The winner is either selected for each individual board with each receiving half of the pot, or the best overall hand takes the entire pot, depending on the rules agreed upon by the players. [ 54 ]   Manila  is a hold'em variant popular in Australia. In Manila, players receive two private cards from a reduced deck (containing no cards lower than 7). A five card board is dealt, unlike Texas hold 'em, one card at a time; there is a betting round after each card. Manila has several variations of its own, similar to the variants listed above.

For the Xbox Live Arcade game, see  Texas Hold 'em (video game) .          Texas hold 'em involves community cards available to all players (pictured here on the left).       Texas hold 'em  (also  hold'em ,  holdem ) is the most popular  poker  game in the casinos and poker card rooms across North America and Europe, as well as  online . According to  Doyle Brunson  and  Johnny Moss , it was originally considered a variation of seven card stud, and was called ""Texas hold 'em seven card stud"" back in the 1920's. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  Hold 'em is a  community card  game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two  hole cards  to make a poker hand, in contrast to  poker variants  like  stud  or  draw  where each player holds a separate individual hand.   After slow but steady gains in popularity throughout the 20th century, hold 'em's popularity surged in the 2000s due to exposure on television, on the Internet and in popular literature. During this time hold 'em replaced  7 card stud  as the most common game in U.S. casinos, almost totally eclipsing the once popular game. [ 3 ]  The  no-limit betting  form is used in the widely televised main event of the  World Series of Poker  (WSOP) and the  World Poker Tour  (WPT).   Because each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, it is an excellent game for  strategic analysis  (including  mathematical analysis ). Hold 'em's simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books which provide recommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing relatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays.

Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.   The game is divided into a series of hands or deals; at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between more than one player is discussed below). A hand may end at  the showdown , in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a  tie . The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand is when all but one player have  folded  and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.   The objective of winning players is not winning every  individual  hand, but rather making mathematically correct decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. By making such decisions, winning poker players maximize long-term winnings by maximizing their  expected utility  on each round of betting.

[ 6 ]   After its invention and spread throughout  Texas , hold 'em was introduced to  Las Vegas  in 1967 by a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including  Crandell Addington ,  Doyle Brunson , and  Amarillo Slim . [ 7 ]  Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. ""They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em... I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game.  Draw poker , you only bet twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game."" [ 8 ]   For several years the  Golden Nugget Casino  in  Downtown Las Vegas  was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was ""truly a ' sawdust  joint,' with... oiled sawdust covering the floors."" [ 9 ]  Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of the now-demolished  Dunes Casino  on the  Las Vegas Strip . This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players. [ 9 ]   After a disappointing attempt to establish a ""Gambling Fraternity Convention"", Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games including Texas hold 'em. In 1970  Benny  and  Jack Binion  acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the  World Series of Poker , and moved it to their casino  Binion's Horseshoe Casino  in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be  no-limit  Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event. [ 9 ]  Interest in the Main Event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only 8 entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over 100 entrants in 1982, and over 200 in 1991. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   During this time, Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide,  Super/System  was first published. [ 13 ]  Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold 'em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. [ 14 ]  A few years later,  Al Alvarez  published a book detailing an early  World Series of Poker  event. [ 15 ]  The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the  World Series of Poker . It is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and poker generally), for the first time, to a wider audience. [ 16 ]   Interest in hold 'em outside of  Nevada  began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although  California  had legal card rooms offering  draw poker , Texas hold 'em was prohibited under a statute which made illegal the now unknown game ""stud-horse"". However in 1988, Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from ""stud-horse"" in  Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp , 271 Cal. Rptr. 792 (1990). Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [ 17 ]  (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a skill game, [ 18 ]  but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker. [ 19 ] ) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers  Terry Rogers  and  Liam Flood  introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   The hold 'em explosion   In the first decade of the 21st century, Texas hold 'em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide. [ 3 ]  Many observers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of  online poker , the game's appearance in film and on television, the  2004-05 NHL lockout , [ 21 ]  the appearance of television commercials advertising online cardrooms, and the  2003 World Series of Poker  championship victory by online qualifier  Chris Moneymaker . [ 22 ]           Joe Hachem , winner of  2005 World Series of Poker  main event         [ edit ]   Television and film       Main article:  Poker on television       Prior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie  Rounders  (1998), starring  Matt Damon  and  Edward Norton , gave moviegoers a romantic view of the game as a way of life. Texas hold 'em was the main game played during the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following  Doyle Brunson , as the ""Cadillac of Poker"". A clip of the classic showdown between  Johnny Chan  and  Erik Seidel  from the  1988 World Series of Poker  was also incorporated into the film. [ 23 ]  More recently, a high-stakes Texas Hold'em game was central to the plot of the 2006  James Bond  film  Casino Royale , in place of  baccarat  which was originally the casino game central to the story in the novel from which the film was based.   Hold 'em tournaments had been televised since the late 1970's, but they did not become popular until 1999, when hidden  lipstick cameras  were first used to show players' private hole cards on the  Late Night Poker  TV show in the United Kingdom. [ 24 ]  Hold 'em exploded in popularity as a spectator sport in the United States and Canada in early 2003, when the World Poker Tour adopted the  lipstick cameras  idea. A few months later,  ESPN 's coverage of the  2003 World Series of Poker  featured the unexpected victory of  Internet  player  Chris Moneymaker , an amateur player who gained admission to the tournament by winning a series of online tournaments. Moneymaker's victory initiated a sudden surge of interest in the World Series, based on the  egalitarian  idea that anyone  even a rank novice  can become a world champion. [ 25 ]   In 2003, there were 839 entrants in the WSOP Main Event, [ 26 ]  and triple that number in 2004. [ 27 ]  The crowning of the  2004 WSOP  champion,  Greg ""Fossilman"" Raymer , a  patent attorney  from Connecticut, further fueled the popularity of the event among amateur (and particularly internet) players. [ 28 ]  In the  2005 Main Event , an unprecedented 5,619 entrants vied for a first prize of $7,500,000. The winner,  Joe Hachem  of Australia, was a semi-professional player. [ 29 ]  This growth continued in 2006, with 8,773 entrants and a first place prize of $12,000,000 (won by  Jamie Gold ). [ 30 ]   Beyond the World Series, other television shows  including the long running  World Poker Tour   are credited with increasing the popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 31 ]  In addition to its presence on network and general audience cable television, [ 32 ]  poker has now become a regular part of sports networks' programming in the United States. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Twenty years after the publication of Alvarez's groundbreaking book,  James McManus  published a semi-autobiographical book,  Positively Fifth Street  (2003), which simultaneously describes the trial surrounding the murder of  Ted Binion  and McManus' own entry into the  2000 World Series of Poker . [ 34 ]  McManus, a poker amateur, finished 5th in the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em main event, winning over $200,000. [ 35 ]  In the book McManus discusses events surrounding the World Series, the trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, poker strategy, and some history of poker and the world series.   Michael Craig 's 2005 book  The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King  details a series of high stakes Texas hold 'em one-on-one games between  Texas   banker   Andy Beal  and a rotating group of poker professionals. As of 2006, these games were the highest stakes ever played, reaching $100,000$200,000  fixed limit . [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Online poker          Poker revenues from  Party Gaming  (2002-2006). The drop off in 2006 is due to the  UIGEA .           Main article:  Online poker       The ability to play cheaply and anonymously online has been credited as a cause of the increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 25 ]  Online poker sites both allow people to try out games and also provide an avenue for entry into large tournaments (like the World Series of Poker) via smaller tournaments known as satellites. Both the 2003 and 2004 winners of the World Series qualified by playing in these tournaments. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   Although online poker grew from its inception in 1998 until 2003, Moneymaker's win and the appearance of televisions advertisements in 2003 contributed to a tripling of industry revenues in 2004. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Rules     The descriptions below assume a familiarity with the general  game play of poker , and with  poker hands . For a general introduction to these topics, see  poker ,  poker hands ,  poker probability , and  poker jargon .       [ edit ]   Betting structures     See the article on  betting  for a detailed explanation of betting in these variations of hold 'em.            A standard hold 'em game showing the position of the blinds relative to the dealer button       Hold 'em is normally played using small and big  blind bets   forced bets by two players.  Antes  (forced contributions by all players) may be used in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of  tournament play . A  dealer button  is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The  small blind  is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The  big blind , posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In  tournament poker , the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. (In some cases, the small blind is some other fraction of a small bet, e.g. $10 is a common small blind when the big blind is $15. The  double-blind  structure described above is a commonly used and more recent adoption.)   When only two players remain, special 'head-to-head' or 'heads up' rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while his/her opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the  flop . After the flop, the dealer acts last and remains this way for the remainder of the hand.   The three most common variations of hold 'em are  limit  hold 'em,  no-limit  hold 'em and  pot-limit  hold 'em. Limit hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em found in casino  live action  games in the United States. [ 3 ]  In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and  flop ) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the  small bet . In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the  big bet . No-limit hold 'em is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the  World Series of Poker . In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an  all-in  bet). The minimum raise is equal to the big blind. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a bet of $6 to a total of $8, a raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise, the initial raiser can not re-raise again. This only matters of course if there was a call before the re-raise. In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).   Most casinos that offer hold 'em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional  live straddle , usually double the amount of the big blind, which then acts as the big blind. No-limit games may also allow multiple re-straddles, in any amount that would be a legal raise. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Play of the hand          Each player is dealt two private cards in hold 'em. They are dealt first.       Play begins with each player being dealt two  cards  face down, with the player in the small blind receiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving the last card dealt. (Like most poker games, the deck is a standard 52-card deck, no jokers.) These cards are the player's  hole  or  pocket cards . These are the only cards each player will receive individually, and they will only (possibly) be revealed at the  showdown , making Texas hold 'em a  closed  poker game.   The hand begins with a ""pre-flop"" betting round, beginning with the player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the dealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing  clockwise . A round of betting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their chips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See  betting  for a detailed account. Note that the blinds are considered ""live"" in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they contribute to the amount that the blind player must contribute, and that, if all players call around to the player in the big blind position, that player may either check or raise.   After the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand, the dealer deals a  flop , three face-up  community cards . The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise.   After the flop betting round ends, a single community card (called the  turn  or fourth street) is dealt, followed by a third betting round. A final single community card (called the  river  or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary.   In all casinos, the dealer will  burn  a card before the flop, turn, and river. Because of this burn, players who are betting cannot see the back of the next community card to come, which might be marked. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   The showdown   If a player bets and all other players fold, then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show his hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a  showdown  occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best five-card  poker hand  he can make from the seven cards comprising his two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of his own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form his final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be  playing the board  and can only hope to  split  the pot, since each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand. [ 13 ]   If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order. It is common for players to have closely-valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as  two pair  or  three of a kind ), then  kickers  are used to settle ties (see the second example below). Note that the card's  numerical  rank is of sole importance;  suit values  are irrelevant in Hold'em.     [ edit ]   Examples     [ edit ]   Sample showdown   Here's a sample showdown:       Board           Bob              Carol              Ted              Alice                Each player plays the best 5-card hand they can make with the seven cards available. They have       Bob     Three fours, with ace, king kicker       Carol     Ace-high flush       Ted     Full house, kings full of fours       Alice     8-high straight       In this case, Ted's full house is the best hand, with Carol in 2nd, Alice in 3rd and Bob last.     [ edit ]   Sample hand          The blinds for this example hand       Here is a sample game involving four players. The players' individual hands will not be revealed until the showdown, to give a better sense of what happens during play:   Compulsory bets:  Alice is the dealer. Bob, to Alice's left, posts a small blind of $1, and Carol posts a big blind of $2.   Pre-flop:  Alice deals two hole cards face down to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Ted must act first because he is the first player after the big blind. He cannot  check , since the $2 big blind plays as a bet, so he folds. Alice  calls  the $2. Bob adds an additional $1 to his $1 small blind to call the $2 total. Carol's blind is ""live"" (see  blind ), so she has the  option  to raise here, but she checks instead, ending the first betting round. The pot now contains $6, $2 from each of three players.   Flop:  Alice now burns a card and deals the flop of three face-up community cards,  9   K   3 . On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the player on the dealer's left begins the betting. In this case it is Bob, who checks. Carol opens for $2, Ted has already folded and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. He calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol's initial bet and $2 to match Alice's raise). Carol calls as well, putting in her $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.   Turn:  Alice now burns another card and deals the turn card face up. It is the  5 . Bob checks, Carol checks, and Alice checks; the turn has been  checked around . The pot still contains $18.   River:  Alice burns another card and deals the final river card, the  9 , making the final board  9   K   3   5   9 . Bob bets $4, Carol calls, and Alice folds (Alice's holding was  A   7 ; she was hoping the river card would be a club to make her hand a  flush ).   Showdown:  Bob shows his hand of  Q   9 , so the best five-card hand he can make is  9   9   9   K   Q , for  three  nines, with a king-queen kicker. Carol shows her cards of  K   J , making her final hand  K   K   9   9   J  for  two pair , kings and nines, with a jack kicker. Bob wins the showdown and the $26 pot.     [ edit ]   Kickers and ties   Because of the presence of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is not uncommon for  kickers  to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) to tie. A kicker is a card which is part of the five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's  rank . For instance, in the hand  A - A - A - K - Q , the king and queen are kickers.   The following situation illustrates the importance of breaking ties with kickers and card ranks, as well as the use of the five-card rule. After the turn, the board and players' hole cards are as follows.       Board (after the turn)           Bob         Carol           At the moment, Bob is in the lead with a hand of  Q   Q   8   8   K , making two pair, queens and eights, with a king kicker. This beats Carol's hand of  Q   Q   8   8   10  by virtue of his king kicker.   Suppose the final card were the  A , making the final board  8   Q   8   4   A . Bob and Carol still each have two pair (Queens and eights), but both of them are now entitled to play the final ace as their fifth card, making their hands both two pair, queens and eights, with an ace kicker. Bob's king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, had the last card been King or lower (except a Queen which would make a full house, or a Ten which would give Carol a higher pair), Bob's King would have stayed in game and he would have won.     [ edit ]   Strategy           Doyle Brunson  is credited with bringing poker strategy to a wider audience         See  Poker strategy  for a more detailed discussion of general poker strategy     Most poker authors recommend a tight- aggressive  approach to playing Texas hold 'em. This strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does play (aggressive). [ 4 ]  Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well. [ 4 ]   Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as  position ) is an important element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em. [ 5 ]  Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.   Because of the game's level of complexity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt to develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold'em tournament as an isolated complex system has had some success, [ 41 ]  although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In addition, groups at the  University of Alberta  and  Carnegie Mellon University  are developing poker playing programs utilizing techniques in  game theory  and  artificial intelligence . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Starting hands       Main article:  Texas hold 'em starting hands              A pair of  aces  is statistically the best hand to be dealt in Texas Hold'em Poker       Because there are only two cards dealt to each player, it is easy to characterize all of the starting hands. There are (52  51)  2 = 1,326 distinct possible  combinations  of two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Because  no suit is more powerful than another , many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy. For example, although  J   J  and  J   J  are distinct combinations of cards, they are of equal value as starting hands.   Viewed this way there are only 169 different hole-card combinations. Thirteen of those hands would be pairs, from 2 through ace. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank (12 possible hands containing an ace, 11 possible hands containing a king and no ace, 10 possible hands containing a queen and no ace or king, etc.). Hole cards can both be used in a  flush  if they are suited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs, and 78 possible unsuited non-pairs, for a total of 169 possible hands. [ 44 ]  Suited starting cards are usually considered stronger than unsuited hands, although the magnitude of this strength in different games is debated. [ 45 ]   Because of this limited number of starting hands, most strategy guides involve a detailed discussion of each of these 169 starting hands. This separates hold 'em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories. Another result of this small number is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual hands. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures   Texas Hold'em is commonly played both as a  ""cash"" or ""ring"" game  and as a  tournament game . Strategy for these different forms varies widely.     [ edit ]   Cash games       Main article:  Ring game       Prior to the invention of  poker tournaments , all poker games were played with real money where players bet actual currency (or chips which represented currency). Games which feature wagering actual money on individual hands are still very common and are referred to as ""cash games"" or ""ring games"".   The  no-limit  and  fixed-limit  cash game versions of hold 'em are strategically very different. Doyle Brunson claims that ""the games are so different that there are  not  many players who rank with the best in both types of hold 'em. Many no-limit players have difficulty  gearing down  for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit."" [ 13 ]  Because the size of bets is restricted in limit games, the ability to  bluff  is somewhat curtailed. Since one is not (usually) risking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances. [ 13 ]   Lower stakes games also exhibit different properties than higher stakes games. Small stakes games often involve more players in each hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and betting) to extremely aggressive (many raises). The difference of small stakes games have resulted in several books dedicated to only those games. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments       Main article:  Poker tournament       Texas hold 'em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the  World Series of Poker 's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. [ 48 ]  Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with  chips  that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to ""buy-in"" a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only a small percentage of the players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. ""The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table"" (usually nine players) ""to get paid for each 100 entrants,"" according to poker expert Andrew N. S. Glazer, in his book,  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker . [ 49 ]  As a result the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.   Proper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one's opponents. [ 4 ]  Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Similar games   There are several other poker variants which resemble Texas hold 'em. Hold 'em is a member of a class of poker games known as  community card games , where some cards are available for use by all the players. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private cards and are thus similar to Texas hold 'em.  Royal hold 'em  has the same structure as Texas hold 'em, but the deck contains only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens. [ 51 ]   Pineapple  and  Omaha hold 'em  both vary the number of cards an individual receives before the flop (along with the rules regarding how they may be used to form a hand), but are dealt identically afterward. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  Alternatively, in  Double-board hold'em  all players receive the same number of private cards, but there are two sets of community cards. The winner is either selected for each individual board with each receiving half of the pot, or the best overall hand takes the entire pot, depending on the rules agreed upon by the players. [ 54 ]   Manila  is a hold'em variant popular in Australia. In Manila, players receive two private cards from a reduced deck (containing no cards lower than 7). A five card board is dealt, unlike Texas hold 'em, one card at a time; there is a betting round after each card. Manila has several variations of its own, similar to the variants listed above.

For the PBS network with the same abbreviation, see  Wisconsin Public Television .   The  World Poker Tour (WPT)  is a series of international  poker tournaments  featuring most of the world's professional players. It was started in the United States by attorney/television producer  Steven Lipscomb , who now serves as  CEO  of WPT Enterprises (WPTE), the firm that controls the World Poker Tour.     [ edit ]   Introduction   The World Poker Tour is a collection of  Texas hold 'em   poker tournaments  held internationally, but mainly in the  United States . The television show and the broadcasts of the World Series of Poker have led to a boom in the table game across American homes, in local casino poker rooms and online. The key sponsors of the tour are casinos and online poker sites. The show, which is syndicated internationally, is co-hosted by  World Series of Poker bracelet  winner  Mike Sexton , and actor  Vince Van Patten .  Shana Hiatt  served as the show host and sideline reporter in its first three seasons.  Courtney Friel  took over the host role for the fourth season, and  Sabina Gadecki  for the fifth.  Layla Kayleigh  and  Kimberly Lansing  began serving as hostesses in season six. WPT has announced that poker player and reporter  Amanda Leatherman , who was hired in July 2008 to host ""live updates"" on the WPT website, will be the hostess for season seven.     [ edit ]   Background   The tour had its debut season in the latter part of 2002 and early part of 2003, climaxing with the WPT Championship in April 2003 at the  Bellagio Casino  in  Las Vegas ,  Nevada . The first season aired on the  Travel Channel  on  American   cable television  in the spring of 2003. The show made its network debut on  February 1 ,  2004  on  NBC  with a special ""Battle Of Champions"" tournament, which aired against  CBS  coverage of the  Super Bowl XXXVIII  pre-game show. The Travel Channel aired the first five seasons of the Tour. In April 2007, WPTE announced that the series would move to  GSN  for its sixth season in the spring of 2008  [ 1 ] . The first WPT tournament to air on GSN, the Mirage Poker Showdown, debuted on  March 24 ,  2008 . In July 2008, WPTE announced that the series would move to  Fox Sports Net  for its seventh season.     [ edit ]   Commentary   The show's hosts Mike Sexton and Vince Van Patten give the impression that all of their commentary is recorded live as the tournament happens, and they have occasionally interacted with the players during the game. However, their comments about hole cards are recorded after the tournament takes place because gaming regulations prohibit them from observing a live feed of the ""hole card cameras"" while on the set. Consequently, the broadcast audio is a mix of the live recording, and commentary recorded in post-production.     [ edit ]   Reception   The drawing power of the WPT and most other poker tournaments is that anyone who can pay the ""buy-in"" (an amount ranging from $2,500 to $25,000) or win a ""satellite"" tournament is able to compete against the top professional players.   In 2004, the World Poker Tour created a  Walk of Fame , inducting poker legends  Doyle Brunson  and  Gus Hansen  as well as actor  James Garner .   Now in its sixth season of broadcast, it still remains among the highest rated television programs on cable. It airs Mondays on Game Show Network. The first three seasons of WPT are also available on  NTSC   DVD . (The second season DVD set features audio commentary by several of the players. The third season is only available in a ""Best Of"" format, featuring just half of the episodes.) CITY TV airs the WPT on Sundays at 4pm PST in Canada with a rebroadcast at Midnight (or shortly after depending on the length of their Sunday Night Movie. The series moved to Monday nights since the move to  GSN  in 2008. Beginning with the 2008 season, host Mike Sexton no longer toasts the winner of the Tournament with an ""official beer of the World Poker Tour"" (sponsored in years past by  Anheuser-Busch ). They now provide champagne glasses for their salute.   The seventh season will be shown on  FSN . In accordance with the agreement, one player a week will win a tournament on ClubWPT.com and appear on a televised show.   A series of spin-off tournaments, titled the  Professional Poker Tour , began filming in 2004. Broadcast of the series was delayed, in part because of a dispute with the Travel Channel over rights. In the fall of 2005, WPTE announced that ""a cable channel"" (believed to be  ESPN ) had withdrawn from bidding for the PPT series, and that WPTE was negotiating with the Travel Channel to air the series. On  January 30 ,  2006 , WPTE and the Travel Channel announced that they had dismissed all open lawsuits. The series began regular broadcast  July 5 ,  2006 , but was suspended after one season as WPTE couldn't find a television home for a second season.     [ edit ]   Sherman Act lawsuit   In July 2006, seven poker professionals sued WPTE, alleging violations of the  Sherman Antitrust Act , the California Cartwright Act, and intentional interference with contract (Complaint [ 2 ]  and Response [ 3 ] ). The professionals ( Chris Ferguson ,  Andy Bloch ,  Annie Duke ,  Joe Hachem ,  Phil Gordon ,  Howard Lederer , and  Greg Raymer ) allege that WPTE's standard release forms, required for participation in WPTE events, are anti-competitive and designed to interfere with their contractual obligations to other companies. The anti-competition claim is based on the fact that WPTE's contracts with the casinos that host its tournaments bar those casinos (and other casinos owned by the same parent companies) from hosting non-WPTE poker events. The claim of interference with contract is based on the releases' claim to perpetual rights to the players' likenesses for any use WPTE wishes. The players claim that this would put them in violation of other contracts (such as Ferguson's Activision Games contract or several players' contracts with online poker sites)  [ 4 ] . Hachem and Raymer dropped out of the lawsuit before its eventual settlement.     [ edit ]   Settlement   In April 2008, WPT Enterprises, Inc. settled with the five remaining players of the lawsuit that was brought against them, Chris Ferguson, said about the settlement,  ""We are happy to have come to an agreement that is fair to all players, and to have put in place a new release that clears up ambiguities in how players' images may be used. We are especially happy that this new release will apply to all poker players who wish to participate in WPT tournaments and events."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   WPT Ladies   In January 2008, the WPT announced a set of tournaments for women, known as WPT Ladies. [ 6 ]  The first season will have five events, with buy-ins ranging from $300 to $1,500. The final table of the final event will be televised.     [ edit ]   WPT Walk of Fame   The  World Poker Tour  Walk of Fame  is designed to honor those  poker  players who have played the game well at the highest levels as well as those who have promoted the spread of it through film, television, and literature.   In February 2004, the World Poker Tour Walk of Fame inducted its first members at the  Commerce Casino  in a ceremony before top pros and celebrities in town for the World Poker Tour Invitational Poker Tournament. The induction ceremony was staged on the doorstep of Commerce Casino.   No new players have been inducted since 2004. The original inductees were  Doyle Brunson ,  Gus Hansen  and  James Garner .     [ edit ]   Player of the Year   Points are awarded for all Open events as follows:     Winner: 1000 points   Runner-up: 700 points   3rd place: 600 points   4th place: 500 points   5th place: 400 points   6th place: 300 points   7th place (TV bubble): 200 points     This award is given out to one player per season.
