Overview      A. INTRODUCTION       State estimates of not only the number of uninsured children but their   characteristics have attracted growing interest with the passage of legislation   establishing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Current   Population Survey (CPS), the most widely cited source of data on the uninsured,   has been criticized because its state samples are inadequate to provide state   estimates of uninsured children with sufficient statistical precision to serve   policy needs. To produce detailed breakdowns of uninsured children goes well   beyond what most of the state samples can support. But while it may be   inappropriate to rely on ""direct sample"" estimation to produce the tabulations   that policymakers require, there exist innovative but well-grounded techniques   for developing state and substate estimates by the application of statistical   procedures that ""borrow strength"" from other data sources. This report employs   statistical procedures that allow us to (1) make use of the entire CPS sample   in developing estimates for each state and (2) incorporate data from a wide   variety of other sources. We apply these procedures to the March 1998 CPS to   develop state estimates of the number of uninsured children in January 1998 by   poverty level and age. The report also includes illustrative estimates of the   number of children simulated to be eligible for Medicaid and the number who   would be eligible for coverage under the SCHIP if the September 1999 rules had   been in effect in 1997.       Part I of this report is organized as follows. Section B discusses the   purpose of the tables in this report, and Section C provides a brief   description of the methodology. Section D presents estimates of uninsured rates   among children for the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), and Section   E presents illustrative estimates of the number of children who are eligible   for Medicaid and SCHIP, by state. These estimates are based on a simulation   model that incorporates state program detail. Finally, Section F discusses some   caveats regarding these estimates.       Part II of the report consists primarily of the state tables--10 per   state. Three of the tables are based entirely on the March 1998 CPS data   without any of the enhancements that we have introduced. They are included to   demonstrate, first, how limiting they are for most states and, second, to show   how closely (or not) our enhanced estimates match in broad terms certain state   characteristics that can be estimated directly from the CPS sample data. A   Technical Appendix follows the state tables and outlines the procedures that we   employed to develop the estimates.                B. PURPOSE OF THE TABLES IN THIS REPORT       While much attention has focused on the inadequacy of the state   estimates of uninsured children that the CPS provides, state and federal needs   go well beyond a simple count of the number of uninsured children (or adults)   in each state. How many of the uninsured children fall into different poverty   levels? What are their ages? The answers to these questions are important   because they have a direct bearing on how many children are eligible for   existing public health insurance programs or may be eligible for new programs.   To states that are trying to incrementally expand their coverage of children,   it is very important to know how many children may become eligible for coverage   with a given incremental change in the eligibility criteria. States need to   know what it will cost, potentially, to extend coverage beyond current levels.   Uncertainty about these numbers and therefore the cost implications of   expanding coverage usually translates into caution in the design of new   programs or modifications to existing programs. With better information, many   states may find that they can afford to be more generous in the coverage that   they extend to the uninsured.       The tables in this report are intended to provide baseline information   that states could find useful in planning future expansions of their SCHIP   initiatives and in evaluating their progress in reducing the number of children   who are without health insurance. (1)    Moreover, the database that was used to create these tables can be used to   generate customized tables that better suit the needs of individual states or   federal policymakers.                C. METHODOLOGY       The estimates presented in this report were derived from the March 1998   CPS public use file after making a number of enhancements discussed below and   in the Technical Appendix. The CPS is a monthly sample survey of 50,000   households in the United States. It serves as the source of the official   monthly unemployment estimates for the nation and the 50 states and the   District of Columbia. Interviews are conducted with all civilian non   institutionalized persons age 15 and older in the sample households. Each   March, the Census Bureau includes a supplemental questionnaire in the CPS   interview. The data collected in this questionnaire are the source of the   official estimates of the incidence of poverty in the United States. In   addition, the March supplement collects information on the health insurance   coverage of all household members (including children). These data have become   the source of the most widely-cited estimates of the number of uninsured   children in the United States each year.       While the CPS sample was designed to support state-level estimates of   unemployment rates and other labor force statistics, the sample sizes for most   states are inadequate for satisfactorily precise monthly estimates that use   only the survey data for that month. (2)    Thus, even if we are producing just a single estimate for each state--such as   the number of uninsured children--that estimate will generally be imprecise due   to the high sampling error associated with small samples. This means that we   will be very uncertain about the true number of uninsured children and able to   say for a typical state only that the number falls within a wide range, a range   that is too wide to provide useful guidance for developing policy or   administering a program.       This problem is even more severe when we must produce many estimates   for each state, such as a table showing the distribution of uninsured children   across poverty and age categories. Then, the already small sample for a state   must be spread across the many cells of the table. It is not unusual for the   available sample to have no observations in some cells even though the state   population obviously has uninsured children with the characteristics defined by   those cells.       When large samples are not available, a standard approach to improving   the precision of sample estimates is to borrow strength. (3)  This entails the development of statistical   models that allow us to derive, say, a 1998 estimate of uninsured children in   Virginia using not only the 1998 data for Virginia from the main sample survey   database but also data from other states, earlier years, and auxiliary sources,   such as administrative records. Knowing something about the numbers of   uninsured children in Virginia in 1996 and 1997 and the numbers of uninsured   children in other states with economic and demographic conditions similar to   Virginia's, we would generally be able to reduce substantially our uncertainty   about how many uninsured children lived in Virginia in 1998.       To derive most of the estimates presented in this report, we have used   a method for borrowing strength that is described in detail by Schirm and   Zaslavsky (1997). With this method, we have reweighted the March 1998 CPS   database to produce 51 sets of weights--one set for each state and the District   of Columbia. We use the Virginia weights to derive estimates for Virginia. Each   of the roughly 50,000 households in the CPS database--regardless of state of   residence--gets a Virginia weight, greatly increasing the size of the sample   from which to obtain estimates for Virginia. How much Virginia weight a   household gets and, therefore, its relative contribution to estimates for   Virginia depends on the household's characteristics. If a household from, say,   Montana has characteristics that would make it unusual were it in Virginia, as   opposed to other states, it receives a relatively small--probably   negligible--Virginia weight. If, instead, a household of that type would be   more common in Virginia than in other states, it receives a relatively large   Virginia weight.       The Virginia weight assigned to a household with a particular set of   characteristics depends on the aggregate characteristics of Virginia.   Specifically, Virginia weights are controlled so that totals derived for   Virginia using Virginia weights equal specified values. For example, the   weights might be controlled so as to reproduce specified totals of children,   children below 100 percent of poverty, and uninsured children. By controlling   the weights, we ensure that the entire database--when weighted according to the   Virginia weights--looks like Virginia in terms of totals that are relevant to   ascertaining the patterns of insurance coverage among children. (4)       In reweighting the March 1998 CPS database, we used controls reflecting   the age and racial/ethnic structure of each state's child population, the   distribution of children across poverty categories, and the numbers of   uninsured children (by poverty category). The full list of totals to which we   controlled weights appears in the Technical Appendix.       Reweighting a database as we have described can substantially improve   the precision of estimates because the samples used to derive the estimates are   much larger than when we use only the observations from a single state. Using   observations from all the states allows us to borrow strength. Although this   alone improves precision, we have further improved precision by using   administrative estimates or empirical Bayes shrinkage estimates--rather than   direct sample estimates --for many of the control totals used in the   reweighting. (5)  The administrative   totals, which are population estimates derived from mainly vital records (and   decennial census) data, have essentially no sampling error, and the shrinkage   totals, which are derived by borrowing strength, are more precise than direct   sample estimates. The specific sources of control totals are described in   greater detail in the  Technical Appendix . (6)          D. ESTIMATES OF THE   UNINSURED       Table I.1 reports the March 1998 CPS sample sizes for all children and   uninsured children by state and compares the model-based estimates of the   uninsured rate with the direct sample estimates. The sample sizes underscore   why it is necessary to employ procedures of the kind used here to construct   state-level tabulations of uninsured children. Most state samples include fewer   than 100 uninsured children, and 15 states have fewer than 50. Spreading such   small numbers of observations over a table with 24 cells (the number of cells   in each of the state tables in Part II) cannot yield much information of   value.

Differences between the model-based and direct sample estimates vary   from 0.1 to 5.2 percentage points (plus or minus). The two estimates are within   one percentage point for 25 states but differ by three percentage points or   more for 8 states. Sample size is clearly relevant but not the sole factor   affecting the size of the difference. For example, all nine states with CPS   sample sizes of more than 1,000 children have differences of 1 percentage point   or less, but the two largest differences occur in states with above average   sample sizes (Arizona and Arkansas). Perhaps more importantly, the model-based   estimates show the impact of shrinkage toward the mean. Generally the most   extreme rates--which are probably too extreme--are pulled toward the center. We   see this in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, where the   model-based estimates are lower than the (high) direct sample estimates, and in   Hawaii, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin, where the model-based   estimates are greater than the (low) direct sample estimates. This result is   not universal, however. There are states with low direct sample uninsured rates   (for example, Vermont and Minnesota) that get assigned even lower rates by the   model-based procedure. As low as the direct sample estimates were in these   states, the regression model predicted even lower rates. Thus the model did not   indiscriminantly eliminate high and low rates.       Table I.2 reports uninsured rates by poverty level for the model-based   estimates. It is quite clear from an examination of these rates that the   model-based procedure does not generate homogenous uninsured rates across the   states. Rather, there are distinctly different patterns in the rates for groups   of states.

              SOURCE: Mathematica Policy Research, from     the March 1998 CPS and other sources.                 For example, there is a general tendency for children who are between   100 percent and 150 percent of poverty to have the highest uninsured rates.   Children below 100 percent of poverty often have access to Medicaid while   children above 150 percent of poverty are more likely to have   employer-sponsored or other private insurance. But despite these tendencies we   do see a number of states in which the uninsured rates are highest among   children under 50 percent of poverty and then decline with each succeeding   higher income level. Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma,   Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming are among the states that fit this pattern. It is   likely that these states have low participation in Medicaid since most children   under 50 percent of poverty will be covered by Medicaid. In general, the states   that fit this pattern have large Hispanic populations or western locations. The   high uninsured rates of Hispanic children are well-documented. For the western   states, the high uninsured rates at low income levels may reflect low   participation in safety net programs generally. Whatever the reason, there is a   clear pattern that the model-based estimates are able to identify.       Four states--Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin--have   single-digit uninsured rates in the two lowest poverty classes. The first three   of these are noted for their broad Medicaid coverage expansions, and we would   guess that Medicaid participation is very high among the eligible populations.   That the model-based estimates can differentiate between these states and the   rest provides additional face validity.          E. ILLUSTRATIVE ESTIMATES OF UNINSURED CHILDREN   ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AND SCHIP       Development of the model-based estimation procedures employed here was   motivated by an interest in applying the methodology of microsimulation to   individual states. Microsimulation is particularly useful for estimating the   incremental impact of small changes in program eligibility on caseloads and   costs, but it requires a very large sample. (7)  To illustrate the application of   microsimulation to the reweighted March 1998 database, we have prepared a   simulation of eligibility under both Medicaid (1997 rules) and SCHIP (September   1999 rules) and applied this simulation model to the reweighted data. The   simulation program captures most of the major elements of state differentiation   in income eligibility limits by age, the use of gross versus net income, and,   to some degree, the application of asset tests. (8)  We base eligibility on annual family   income rather than trying to construct monthly income streams that would allow   a more literal replication of the Medicaid eligibility determination. This is a   widely-used practice--in large part because the CPS and other major surveys   collect only annual income data. Furthermore, given that the CPS provides only   annual rather than monthly estimates of insurance coverage, basing eligibility   on simulated monthly rather than reported annual income would not solve the   problem of relating eligibility to insurance coverage.        The first four columns of Table I.3 present state estimates of the   number of uninsured children, the number of all children who were simulated to   be eligible for Medicaid (without regard to insurance coverage), and both the   number and percentage of these Medicaid-eligible children who were reported as   uninsured. The final three columns present estimates of children who were   simulated to be eligible for either Medicaid or SCHIP (again without regard to   insurance coverage) and the number and percentage of these   Medicaid/SCHIP-eligible children who were uninsured. Medicaid eligibility is   based on program rules that were in effect in 1997 while SCHIP eligibility is   based on state program provisions that were in effect in September 1999. Thus   SCHIP eligibility is prospective or hypothetical rather than actual eligibility   in 1997. It should be noted as well that even in the absence of SCHIP, Medicaid   eligibility would have grown between 1997 and 1999. Earlier reforms extended   eligibility to low income children who were born after September 30, 1983. As   these children age, a larger and larger share of all children are made eligible   by these provisions.

         SOURCE: Mathematica Policy Research, from     the March 1998 CPS and other sources.                 Across all of the states, our estimates of uninsured children who were   eligible for Medicaid total 4.2 million out of the 11.5 million uninsured   children under 19. Our simulation of SCHIP eligibility suggests that SCHIP   would have extended eligibility for public insurance coverage to about 2.4   million additional children.       The estimated percentage of simulated Medicaid-eligible children who   were uninsured in each state helps us to understand the patterns of uninsurance   among low income children that we saw in Table I.2. Nationally, 22.0 percent of   our simulated Medicaid-eligible children were uninsured. Among the states, this   rate varies from a low of 7 percent (Minnesota and Wisconsin) to a high of 33   percent (Arizona). Generally, states with higher uninsured rates among children   under 100 percent of poverty than among children between 100 and 150 percent of   poverty have high rates of Medicaid-eligible uninsured in Table I.3. For   example, Arizona, Florida, and Idaho have higher uninsured rates in the two   lowest poverty classes than in the 100 to 150 percent class, and all three have   Medicaid-eligible uninsured rates in excess of 30 percent. At the other end of   the distribution, we singled out Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin for   their relatively low uninsured rates among children below 100 percent of   poverty, and all four of these have Medicaid-eligible uninsured rates below 10   percent.       Some important implications of the impact of SCHIP eligibility at the   state level can be seen in Table I.4, which shows by state the number of   uninsured children who were  not  simulated to be Medicaid-eligible and   both the number and percentage of these who would be made eligible for coverage   under SCHIP. Nationally, SCHIP would extend eligibility to about one-third of   the uninsured children who were not otherwise eligible for Medicaid in 1997.   This varies substantially by state--in part because some states were already   covering a large part of the population that other states would now cover under   SCHIP. Hawaii and Minnesota, which provide broad coverage under Medicaid, would   extend coverage to fewer than 5 percent of the uninsured who were not eligible   for Medicaid, whereas Alabama, with comparatively low Medicaid coverage, would   extend coverage through SCHIP to nearly 60 percent of its remaining uninsured   children. At the same time, Texas with comparatively low Medicaid coverage   would extend coverage through SCHIP to only 12 percent of its remaining   uninsured children while DC would extend coverage to 57 percent.

(9)  In the   final column we see that three states would leave more than 10 percent of their   low income children uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid or SCHIP: Arkansas   (16 percent), Mississippi (11 percent), and Texas (13 percent). (10)  Most states, however, would leave   fewer than 2 percent of their low income children uninsured and ineligible for   Medicaid or SCHIP.

F. CAVEATS ABOUT THESE   ESTIMATES       We highlight three caveats that apply to the tables presented in Part   II and one additional caveat that applies to further use of the reweighted CPS   database. The first three are the CPS's undercount of the Medicaid population,   the overstatement of uninsurance among infants, and the limitations of the   Medicaid simulation. The fourth involves limitations on the kinds of data that   can be tabulated with the reweighted database.      1. Medicaid Undercount       It is widely known that the Medicaid enrollment in the CPS understates   estimates compiled from the states' program administrative statistics. It is   much less widely known that this Medicaid undercount has been growing. (11)  It is very likely that at least some   of the children reported as uninsured were actually covered by Medicaid. (12)    We have not attempted to adjust our estimates in any way for this Medicaid   undercount, so a portion (and perhaps a large portion) of those children that   we report as eligible for Medicaid but uninsured may have actually been covered   by Medicaid. (13)      2. Uninsured Rates for Infants         Despite their greater access to Medicaid, infants are reported to have   higher uninsured rates than children 1 to 5. This is peculiar to the CPS,   however, and it is very likely due to a combination of two factors: (1) the   uninsured being identified as those who report no insurance (as opposed to   reporting that they were uninsured) and (2) insurance coverage being measured   for the previous year (Czajka and Lewis 1999). Children born between the end of   the reference year and the March survey date cannot in truth be described as   having had coverage of any kind the previous year, and parents who answer the   questions literally will end up with their newborn infants classified as   uninsured. It is not possible to identify infants born after the end of the   reference year, and so it is not possible to screen out those who may have been   misclassified. Users of the data need to be aware that the rate of uninsurance   among infants is overstated.       3. Medicaid Eligibility       The rules governing Medicaid eligibility, which vary by state, are   extraordinarily complex. A complete simulation of all the ways that a child can   become eligible for Medicaid is impossible--both because of the limitations of   survey data and because the full details of eligibility, state by state, are   not documented in any accessible form. For this reason, any Medicaid   eligibility simulation is going to involve simplifications. It is quite rare,   for example, that anyone simulates eligibility under the medically needy   provisions, other than indirectly, and we have not done so here. Nor have we   incorporated state-specific differences in the calculation and application of   disregards. The information required to do so for all of the states is not   readily available, and that limits not only our own simulation but those that   could be constructed by others--even with substantially more resources.      4. Tabulating the Reweighted Database       The reweighting of the CPS database for state estimation was   accomplished by applying a number of controls that, depending on which of the   51 sets of weights is chosen, make the database ""look like"" a specific state.   The controls were chosen because of their relevance to estimating the number of   uninsured children by age and poverty level. While it is possible to tabulate   any field on the CPS file with the state weights that we have constructed, the   state-specificity of the resulting tabulation deteriorates with the declining   relevance of children's age, race and Hispanic origin, poverty level, and   insurance coverage (insured or not) to the fields being tabulated. In addition,   fields that depend on rules that differ across states, such as AFDC   participation or Medicaid participation, may be inconsistent with the rules in   most other states and, for this reason, should not be tabulated or used to   infer eligibility in a simulation algorithm. (14)                II. State Estimates       The sections that follow present ten tabulations for each of the 50   states and the District of Columbia. The tables are organized by state. Each   table consists of a cross-tabulation of a defined population of children by   poverty level and age. The tables utilize six poverty levels:           Less than 50 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)      50 percent to less than 100 percent      100 percent to less than 150 percent      150 percent to less than 200 percent      200 percent to less than 350 percent      350 percent or greater           The four age categories are:           Less than 1 year of age (infant)      1 to 5      6 to 12      13 to 18           These age categories match those that the Health Care Financing   Administration is using in reports of SCHIP enrollment.       Each table describes a different population or sub population within   the state. The first seven tables were produced from the reweighted CPS   database. That is, they are model-based estimates. They are dated January 1998   rather than March 1998 because the population estimates that were used as   external controls are effectively January 1998 numbers.           Table II.A: Model-based Estimates of the Number of Children by Age     and Poverty Level, January 1998      Table II.B: Model-based Estimates of the Number of Children in     January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.C: Model-based Estimates of the Percent of Children in     January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.D: Model-based Estimates of Simulated Medicaid-Eligible     Children, January 1998      Table II.E: Model-based Estimates of Simulated Medicaid-Eligible     Children in January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.F: Model-based Estimates of Simulated SCHIP- or     Medicaid-eligible Children, January 1998      Table II.G: Model-based Estimates of Simulated SCHIP- or     Medicaid-eligible Children in January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous     Year           The final three tables are direct sample estimates from the March 1998   survey. They use no other data. They provide counterparts to the first three of   the tables listed above and were included so that we could demonstrate on a   state-by-state basis how much our borrowing strength methodology has improved   our ability to produce usable state-level information. These final three tables   are:           Table II.H: Direct Sample Estimates of the Number of Children by Age     and Poverty Level, March 1998      Table II.I: Direct Sample Estimates of the Number of Children in     March 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.J: Direct Sample Estimates of the Percent of Children in     March 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year           These tables are dated March 1998 because the March CPS sample is   weighted to population estimates for the month of March. (15)       We walk through these tables for Alabama to illustrate their   interpretation. Table II.A.1 indicates that there were about 1.2 million   children in Alabama in January 1998 and provides a breakdown by poverty level   and age. (16)  These estimates indicate,   for example, that there were 122,000 children in families with incomes below 50   percent of poverty and that about 33,000 were 13 to 18 years old. Table II.B.1   shows the number of uninsured children, which totaled 195,000. Children in   families between 100 and 150 percent of poverty accounted for the largest   number of uninsured (47,100) in any poverty class and nearly three times as   many as children in families above 350 percent of poverty. Table II.C.1 gives   the percentage of children who were uninsured in the previous year. The   estimates in this table were prepared by dividing each cell entry in Table   II.B.1 by the corresponding cell entry in Table II.A.1. Table II.C.1 indicates,   for example, that 19 percent of all Alabama children 13 to 18 years old were   uninsured while 38 percent of the 13 to 18 year-olds in families under 50   percent of poverty were uninsured.       Table II.D.1 presents estimates of the number of Alabama children who   were simulated to be eligible for Medicaid, without regard to their existing   insurance coverage. Very small numbers with family incomes above 200 percent of   poverty appear to be eligible, indicating the impact of income disregards that   extend eligibility beyond the nominal limits. Table II.E.1 shows how many of   these simulated Medicaid-eligible children were uninsured the previous year.   Note that none of the children who were simulated to be eligible with family   incomes above 200 percent of poverty were uninsured. Table II.F.1 provides   estimates of the number of children who were simulated to be eligible for   either Medicaid or SCHIP. (17)  Table   II.F.1 shows that about 533,000 Alabama children were simulated to be eligible   for either program when existing insurance coverage was ignored while Table   II.G.1 shows that only 141,000 of these eligible children were actually   uninsured the previous year.       Tables II.H.1, II.I.1, and II.J.1 are direct sample estimates from the   CPS, and they correspond in content to Tables II.A.1, II.B.1, and II.C.1. Table   II.H.1 shows all children, and it is about 90,000 lower than the total   represented in Table II.A.1. The difference is due to our use of population   controls that are external to the CPS and that include detail for children   under 15. (18)  While the totals are   nearly the same, however, there are striking differences between Tables II.A.1   and II.H.1 in the estimates for combinations of poverty level and age. For   example, Table II.A.1 shows almost 7,000 infants below 50 percent of poverty   while table II.H.1 shows double that number (and half as many as the number 1   to 5). The differences between Tables II.B.1 and II.I.1, which show the number   of uninsured children, are even more dramatic. Table II.I.1 contains several   cells for which there were no sample observations whereas Table II.B.1 has no   empty cells. The totals are different because our model-based estimate of the   uninsured rate in Alabama was higher than the CPS direct sample estimate (see   Table I.1). The relative numbers of children in adjacent age categories in   Table II.I.1 fluctuate dramatically across poverty levels. For example, there   are more than twice as many 13 to 18 year-olds as 6 to 12 year-olds between 100   and 150 percent of poverty but 10 times as many 6 to 12 year-olds as 13 to   18-year olds between 200 and 350 percent of poverty. In Table II.B.1 the   relative numbers of children in the two age groups vary little by poverty level   until the top category. Finally, the uninsured rates reported in Table II.J.1   show sharp fluctuations across the table and even between adjoining cells   whereas those reported in Table II.C.1 are much smoother.           Footnotes:           1.  An earlier application of the methodology employed   in this report was used to assist the State of New Jersey in its SCHIP design   and planning efforts (see Czajka, Rosenbach, and Schirm 1999).      2.  Recognizing the limitations of the CPS, Congress   has appropriated funds for enhancing the CPS to support more precise state   estimates of the numbers of uninsured children. But, such enhancements have not   yet been designed, let alone implemented, and it is unlikely that the expanded   sample will support detailed breakdowns of uninsured children.      3.  Estimators that borrow strength have been used   successfully in administering important public programs. For example, the   Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses data from administrative sources to help   construct the monthly estimates of state unemployment rates. Another estimator   has been used for several years to derive state estimates for allocating   federal funds under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,   Infants, and Children (WIC) (Schirm and Long 1995). Similar estimators have   also been used to obtain state and county estimates of poor school-aged   children for allocating federal Title I funds for compensatory education in   elementary and secondary schools (National Research Council 1998). Thus the   methodology that we employ in producing the tables presented in this report   follows a long line of successful applications of statistical enhancements to   the CPS for the purpose of preparing estimates at the state level.      4.  In contrast, with the original CPS sample weights,   the database looks like the whole United States.      5.  Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods average direct   sample estimates with predictions from regression models that derive their   predictions based on state characteristics measured by decennial census and   administrative records data (e.g., the poverty rate according to the census or   the ratio of children enrolled in Medicaid, according to Medicaid   administrative data, to the total population of children, which is derived from   a combination of census and administrative data).      6.  Prior to reweighting the CPS database to borrow   strength, we controlled the weights of households  within  each state to   a set of population totals characterizing the age and race/ethnic structure of   the state's child population (the same set of totals that is later used in the   reweighting). Such control totals are not used by the Census Bureau in   weighting the CPS because of the emphasis placed on using the survey for   producing employment estimates. Indeed, the only state-level control on weights   used by the Census Bureau is the total population aged 16 and over, which is   regarded as the population of working age. Because we are developing estimates   pertaining to the child population, our within-state adjustment of weights to   child population totals should improve the precision of the estimates. Then,   borrowing strength by reweighting should lead to further improvements in   precision.      7.  If the underlying database is too small, the   estimates of incremental changes to programs tend to be either zero or   excessively large.      8.  For Medicaid, the most important limitation of our   simulation is the exclusion of eligibility under state medically needy   provisions. The CPS lacks the medical expenditure data required to simulate   these provisions. For SCHIP the most important limitation is our inability to   take into account the waiting periods that a number of states have introduced   to discourage parents from dropping employer-sponsored coverage for their   children and enrolling them in SCHIP. The CPS provides no information on   duration of uninsurance and, furthermore, the details on state waiting periods   that we would require in order to simulate them are not readily available.   These waiting periods can reduce potential eligibility by a significant amount.        9.  Poverty in this table is measured relative to the   Census Bureau's poverty thresholds while program eligibility is based on the   poverty guidelines released by the Department of Health and Human Services   (DHHS). While generally similar, the two series differ in a number of respects,   and this may account for the fact that small percentages of children below 200   percent of poverty are simulated to be ineligible for Medicaid or SCHIP in   states with SCHIP eligibility limits of 200 percent. The Census Bureau poverty   threshold may define 200 percent of poverty as a slightly higher dollar figure   than the corresponding DHHS guideline used to determine eligibility, such that   a small number of children fall between the two figures. In addition, the   poverty guidelines recognize the markedly higher living costs in Hawaii and   Alaska than the rest of the nation and are set at higher levels while the   Census Bureau thresholds are undifferentiated across the states.      10.  Access to coverage among low income children in   Arkansas, currently, is actually better than this suggests. In September 1997,   Arkansas implemented the ARKids First program under a section 1115 Medicaid   waiver. Because of its late introduction, this program which provides coverage   for children up to 200 percent of poverty is not included in our simulation of   Medicaid eligibility in 1997 for the state of Arkansas. Nor is it included in   the combined Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility simulation, which mixes Medicaid   eligibility rules in 1997 with SCHIP eligibility rules as of September 1999. A   simulation based on a later point in time would very likely include this   extended coverage under SCHIP; state officials have indicated that there are   plans to transform ARKids First into a state SCHIP (Irvin and Czajka 2000).        11.  Comparison of CPS estimates with Medicaid   administrative statistics indicates that the CPS undercount of Medicaid   children under 15  grew  by about 3 million children between the March   1994 and March 1998 surveys. In March 1994 the undercount was estimated to be   about 17 percent or 3.2 million children. See Czajka and Lewis (1999) for a   discussion.      12.  Underreporting of coverage probably accounts for   most of the Medicaid undercount. Persons who failed to report their Medicaid   coverage could have reported another form of coverage during the year--either   as an incorrect description of their Medicaid coverage or as other coverage   that they actually had during the year. Part of the undercount could also be   due to CPS underrepresentation of low income households. This has quite   different implications, however. If low income households are underrepresented,   then not only Medicaid enrollees but uninsured people will be undercounted as   well. We are not aware of any evidence of an under-representation of low income   households in the CPS, but the possibility is one that must be recognized.   Under-representation of low income households might arise for many of the same   reasons that the decennial census undercounts the population.      13.  Both our ASPE project officers and the majority   of a technical advisory committee recommended against any adjustment for the   Medicaid undercount. The concern is not about the reality of a sizable   undercount but the uncertainty as to what it implies about the estimate of the   uninsured.      14.  Researchers who apply microsimulation to   estimate changes in eligibility under hypothetical program reforms are familiar   with the limitations of reported participation under such scenarios. Schirm and   Zaslavsky (1998) propose a solution to this problem.      15.  As we explain in the Technical Appendix, one of   the ways in which our methodology reduces the sampling error in state estimates   of uninsured children is by incorporating more state-specific detail for   children than the Census Bureau uses in weighting the March CPS. The added   detail includes race and Hispanic origin and multiple age categories. In order   to include this additional detail, however, we had to use population estimates   that the Census Bureau prepares for July 1 of each year. We averaged the July 1   estimates for 1997 and 1998, yielding estimates that we then characterize as   January 1, 1998.      16.  The numeral 1 is appended to each of the 10   tables for Alabama, the numeral 2 to each of the 10 tables for Alaska, and so   on.      17.  We combine the two programs because the SCHIP   eligibility criteria that we were asked to use refer to September 1999 while   the Medicaid eligibility criteria apply to 1997. Medicaid eligibility is   continuing to grow because of the phase-in of poverty-related eligiblity   provisions, so subtracting the 1997 Medicaid eligibles from the 1999 SCHIP   eligibles would attribute too much of the growth in eligibility to SCHIP.      18.  As we noted in an earlier footnote, the Census   Bureau applies no state-specific controls to the population under 16 when it   constructs weights for the CPS.

The provision requires that a State, which has entered into an                agreement with the Commissioner for Federal administration of the                State's supplementary payments, to remit payments and fees no                later than the business day preceding the SSI payment date.

The administrative fees would be credited to a special fund of the                U.S. Treasury to defray expenses in carrying out title VIII and                federally administered State recognition payments.

There are four                categories of statutory employees-certain full-time life insurance                sales people, agent drivers or commission drivers, homeworkers and                full-time traveling or city salespeople. While these individuals                will continue to be treated as statutory employees for Social                Security purposes and self-employed for income tax purposes, they                now will be treated as self-employed for SSI purposes.                 The provision is effective upon enactment.                Individual Development Accounts (Section 610)                               Excludes for determining means-tested program eligibility and                benefit amount, funds (and accrued interest) in an individual                development account provided for under the ""Assets for                Independence Act"" (P.L. 105-285). (Previously only matching funds                were excluded. The funds deposited by the individual and interest                on those deposits could have been counted for SSI purposes.)

Establishes a 45-day period for the processing of initial                claims, a 30-day period for the processing of appeals at the                reconsideration level, a 90-day period for the processing of                appeals at the hearing level, and a 90-day period for the                processing of appeals to the Departmental Appeals Board of the                Department of Health and Human Services.                 Permits the party requesting the hearing to waive the 90-day                time limit at the hearing level.                 These provisions apply with respect to initial determinations                made on or after October 1, 2002.                Permitting Premium Reductions Additional Benefits Under              Medicare+Choice Plans (Title VI, Subtitle A, Section 606)                               Allows, beginning for plan year 2003, managed care providers                participating in the Medicare Plus Choice program to offer                beneficiaries, instead of options for additional services as                required under current law, a reduction in the Part B Medicare                premium. The reduction could take the form of a reduction in the                premium withheld from monthly Social Security benefits, a                retroactive adjustment in the amount withheld or a rebate.                 Outreach on Availability of Medicare Cost-Sharing Assistance to              Eligible Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (Title IX, Subtitle B,              Section 911)                               Adds section 1144 to the Social Security Act, which requires                that the Commissioner of Social Security:                                   Identify Medicare beneficiaries-- Qualified Medicare                  Beneficiaries (QMBs), Specified Low-Income Medicare (SLMBs), and                  Qualified Individuals (QI's) -- who may be eligible for payment                  of the cost of Medicare cost-sharing under the Medicaid program                  (although not specified, presumably on the basis of the amount                  of the beneficiary's title II benefit);                   Notify individuals who may be eligible of the availability                  of cost sharing assistance under the Medicaid program that the                  assistance is conditioned on meeting the eligibility                  requirements, including an assets test, of individual States'                  cost-sharing programs under Medicaid;                   Furnish each State agency administering a cost-sharing                  program under Medicaid the name and address of beneficiaries who                  live in that State and who are identified as potentially                  eligible for cost-sharing; and                   Update information for the States each year, including                  information on beneficiaries who may have become eligible for a                  cost-sharing program during the year because of a reduction in                  their title II benefits.                  The provision is effective one year after the date of                enactment.                 Requires that the Comptroller General study and report to the                Congress on the impact of section 1144 on the enrollment in                cost-sharing programs of individuals and make recommendations for                legislative changes the Comptroller deems appropriate. The report                is due 18 months after the Commissioner of Social Security first                conducts outreach under the provision.                Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (H.R. 5662)               Title III-Subtitle A-Administrative Provisions               Adjustments for Consumer Price Index Error (Section 308)                               Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine                whether a technical error in the computation of the Consumer Price                Index for 1999 has or will result in a shortfall in payments to                beneficiaries of Federal benefits programs, including Social                Security and SSI payments and payments under title VIII of the                Social Security Act (Special Veterans Benefits) as compared to                payments that would have been made had the error not occurred.                 Requires the head of any agency administering Federal benefits                programs to make an initial determination as to whether, and the                extent to which, the error resulted in a shortfall to                beneficiaries; and submit a report, no later than 30 days after                enactment, to the Director of OMB and to each House of the                Congress describing the shortfall.                 Requires OMB, within 60 days after enactment, to direct that                payment or payments be made to compensate for any identified                shortfall.                 Provides that payments made as a result of this change in the                law shall be disregarded in determining income under title VIII of                the Social Security Act or any applicable means-tested program.                 Also requires the Director of OMB to submit to Congress by                April 1, 2001, a report on the activities undertaken by OMB in                accordance with this section.                                                                                                     Privacy        Policy  |  Accessibility Policy  |         Linking Policy  |  Site        Map"
GX236-21-3439549	"Preface The Supplement is a major data resource on our nation's social insurance and welfare programs. The majority of the data concern the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance programs, known collectively as Social Security, and the Supplemental Security Income program. The Supplement has been published annually since 1940. Decisions affecting the future of Social Security are facilitated by the availability of relevant data over a long period. The data provide a base for research, policy analysis, and proposals for changing the programs. In addition to meeting the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) information needs, the Supplement strengthens the agency's ability to respond to requests for program data from congressional committees, government agencies at all levels, and the research community. One of our most important goals is to provide clear and meaningful program data. For this reason, we have repackaged the all-in-one Table 5.A1 into smaller, more manageable statistical tables so that it is easier to locate data on specific beneficiary populations. The Supplement is prepared by SSA staff from various components throughout the agency. I would also like to express my thanks to the many people in other federal agencies for their contributions. The inside cover includes a list of the agencies and persons contributing to this edition. General questions or comments about this report are welcome and should be directed to Rona M. Blumenthal at 410-965-0163 or rona.m.blumenthal@ssa.gov. For specific questions about the data, please call the contact listed on each table. This report is available on our Web site at www.ssa.gov/policy. For additional copies of the report, please telephone 202-358-6274 or e-mail ores.publications@ssa.gov.

Of the 2001 awards, 502,800 went to blind or disabled recipients aged 18-64, 157,000 to those blind or disabled under age 18, and 110,800 to recipients aged 65 or older.  4  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Health Care Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A) Total benefits paid in calendar year 2001 Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) Total benefits paid in calendar year 2001 Number of enrollees in July 2001, (one or both of Parts A and B) Aged Disabled Administrative costs, 2001 Hospital Insurance As a percentage of total benefits paid Supplementary Medical Insurance As a percentage of total benefits paid Medicaid Medical service expenditures in fiscal year 1998 Number of unduplicated recipients, fiscal year 1998 Average 1998 vendor payment per unduplicated recipient Persons aged 65 or older Permanently and totally disabled persons Dependent children under age 21 Average 1998 vendor payment for medical services Nursing facility services Inpatient general hospital care Prescribed drugs Physicians services $142.3 billion 40.7 million $10,242 $9,095 $1,203 $19,379 $5,031 $699 $327 $141.2 billion $99.7 billion 40.0 million 34.4 million 5.5 million $2.2 billion 1.6 percent $1.7 billion 1.7 percent  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  5   Unemployment Insurance 2001 Total payments Average-- Weekly benefit amount (regular programs) Duration of benefits Weekly insured unemployment Covered employment $31.6 billion $238 13.8 weeks 3.0 million 127.9 billion  Workers' Compensation 2000 Benefit payments Total Compensation payments Medical and hospitalization Benefits paid by-- Private insurance carriers State and federal funds Employers' self-insurance Covered workers per month Costs as a percentage of covered payroll  $45.9 billion 25.9 billion 20.0 billion 25.7 billion 10.4 billion 9.8 billion 126.6 million 1.25 percent  Temporary Disability Insurance Programs in effect in-- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the railroad industry.

Eligibility and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's contributions to Social Security. Benefits are paid as an earned right to workers, their families and their survivors. There is no means test to qualify for benefits. At the end of December 2001, 45.9 million people were receiving benefits at a rate exceeding $36 billion each month ($432 billion annually). According to the latest Social Security Trustees Report, these cash benefits comprised 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. During the same year, approximately 153 million employees and self-employed workers, along with employers, contributed more than $516 billion to the OASDI trust funds--through which contributions are credited and benefits are paid. Social Security benefits are essential to the economic well-being of millions of individuals. Social Security pays benefits to more than 90 percent of those 65 or older. It is the major source of income (providing 50 percent or more of total income) for 64 percent of the beneficiaries. It contributes 90 percent or more of income for almost one-third of the beneficiaries, and is the only source of income for 20 percent of them (see Charts 14 at the end of this section). 1. Monthly benefits for workers and their families. 2. Vocational rehabilitation services for disabled beneficiaries. 3. Administrative costs (currently less than 1 percent of expenditures). 4. The lump-sum death payment to eligible survivors. Revenue received from FICA payments is transferred to the U.S. Treasury. FICA revenue in excess of outlays is used to purchase special interest-bearing Treasury bonds. These securities remain assets of the trust funds until needed to cover Social Security costs. 0  Structure and Organization The OASDI program is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which became an independent agency in 1995. The Commissioner of Social Security serves a 6-year term following appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate. A bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board serves to review existing laws and policies and commissions studies and issues recommendations intended to anticipate changing circumstances. The President appoints three of the seven board members and Congress appoints the other four members. The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. Major headquarter components include the National Computer Center that contains SSA's mainframe computers that drive our systems, much of the executive staff for policy, programs and systems as well as field support components. SSA's field structure is divided into 10 geographic regions containing over 1,300 field installations in communities throughout the country. Office sizes range from large urban offices with 50 or more employees to remote resident stations staffed by one or two individuals. Each region is headed by a Regional Commissioner, and staffed with specialists to handle regional administrative tasks and to assist field offices with operational issues. In addition, there are teleservice centers servicing all regions. While physically located within the various regions, each teleservice center manages the public's Social Security business from throughout the nation using state of the art communications systems. Seven program service centers provide service and support for the field offices in some aspects of Social Security's workloads. Tables 2.F12.F11 provide SSA administrative data on the agency's national workforce (Tables 2.F12.F3), claims workloads (Tables 2.F42.F6), delivery of services (Table 2.F7), and its hearings and appeals operations (Tables 2.F82.F11).  Contributions and Trust Funds A person contributes to Social Security either through payroll taxes or self-employment taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA). Employers match the employee contribution, while self-employed workers pay an amount equal to the combined employer-employee contributions. (Self-employed workers receive a special tax deduction to ease the impact of paying the higher rate.) There is a maximum yearly amount of earnings subject to OASDI taxes, $84,900 in 2002. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance. Employees whose contributions exceed the maximum taxable amount because they worked for more than one employer can receive refunds of excess FICA payments when they file their tax returns. Taxes are allocated to the Old-Age (Retirement) and Survivors Insurance (OASI), the Disability Insurance (DI), and the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. In addition to the taxes on covered earnings, OASI and DI trust fund revenues include interest on trust fund securities, income from taxation of OASI and DI benefits, certain technical transfers, and gifts or bequests. By law, the OASI and DI trust funds may only be disbursed for:  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  9   Social Security  Significant Program Changes Program changes occur through legislation or (in areas where authority is delegated to the Commissioner) through regulation. Elimination of Annual Earnings Test for Persons Reaching Full Retirement Age Public Law 106-182, The Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary attains full retirement age (FRA). Elimination of this earnings test is effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1999. The earnings limit that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the limits previously established for persons at FRA through age 69--$25,000 in 2001, and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $3 of earnings above these exempt amounts. In determining earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. The legislation also permits retired workers to earn delayed retirement credits for any months between the attainment of full retirement age and age 70 for which the worker requests that benefits not be paid. Public Law 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continued to be pegged to increases in the average wage. This amount increased from $10,680 in 2001 to $11,280 in 2002. Withholding for beneficiaries subject to this earnings test is at $1 for each $2 of earnings over the exempt amounts. Work Incentives Improvement Act The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, Public Law 106-170, was enacted on December 17, 1999. This legislation provides major enhancements to SSA's programs that assist disabled beneficiaries who attempt to return to work. It provides beneficiaries more choices in vocational rehabilitation services, and offers expanded health care for beneficiaries who are no longer eligible for cash benefits due to work. Effective October 1, 2000, the Act offers extended Medicare coverage to beneficiaries who return to work, and offers buy-in for Medicaid coverage. The Ticket to Work provisions of this legislation are being phased in over a 3-year period that began January 1, 2001. The Ticket to Work will emphasize and encourage rehabilitation efforts and will reimburse private employment service providers for their services to beneficiaries attempting to return to work. These providers are called Employment Networks. Most disability beneficiaries will receive a Ticket that they may use to obtain vocational rehabilitation, job training, or other support services.  Individuals may take their ticket to any of the Employment Networks that offer services in their communities. By the end of 2002, SSA expects to have distributed tickets to beneficiaries in 33 states and the District of Columbia. In 2003, tickets will be distributed in the remaining 17 states, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Also beginning January 1, 2001, former beneficiaries may have their benefits resumed if their work activity ends within 5 years of the month their benefits stopped and they are still disabled Regulatory Increases in Substantial Gainful Activity and in Trial Work Period Amounts Effective July 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration raised from $500 to $700 the amount of monthly earnings for a nonblind disabled individual to be considered engaging in substantial gainful activity (SGA). Effective January 1, 2001, the top SGA level was raised to $740 per month, with the provision that ongoing SGA levels will be automatically adjusted annually based on increases in the national average wage index. Effective January 1, 2002, the level is $780 per month. The SGA threshold is part of the definition of disability that requires an individual to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity to be eligible for benefits. Earnings of more than the top SGA level will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is engaged in SGA. Earnings of less than $780 per month will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is not engaged in SGA. A different definition of SGA applies to blind persons receiving Social Security disability benefits. Increases in the SGA amount for blind individuals have long been pegged to increases in the national average wage index and thus were not affected by the 1999 or subsequent rule changes. The level for blind individuals increased from $1,240 in 2001 to $1,300 in 2002. New rules also affect the trial work period (TWP). The TWP allows disability beneficiaries to test their ability to work for at least 9 months. During the TWP, beneficiaries may earn any amount and still receive full benefits. The monthly level at which earnings count toward the 9-month TWP was raised from $200 to $530 effective January 1, 2001, with future increases pegged to the national average wage index. Effective January 1, 2002, the level is $560. After completion of 9 trial work months, the SGA level is used to determine whether earnings are substantial or not. If earnings fall below the SGA level, full benefits generally continue. If earnings are higher than the SGA level, cash benefits are usually suspended while medical benefits continue. Table 2.A30 provides related historical data on disability program earnings guidelines, including reference to recent changes in thresholds for determining SGA.  10  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security  Coverage and Financing In 2001, about 153 million persons worked in employment or self-employment covered under the OASDI program. In recent years, coverage has become nearly universal for work performed in the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately 96 percent of the American workforce are covered by OASDI. Workers excluded from coverage fall into five major categories: 1. Civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, 2. Railroad workers (who are covered under the railroad retirement system, which is coordinated with Social Security), 3. Certain employees of state and local governments who are covered under their employers' retirement systems, 4. Domestic workers and farm workers whose earnings do not meet certain minimum requirements (workers in industry and commerce are covered regardless of the amount of earnings), and 5. Persons with very low net earnings from selfemployment, generally under $400 annually. 0  A self-employed person pays the combined employeeemployer rate of 12.4 percent for OASDI and 2.9 for HI under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA). Two deduction provisions reduce the SECA and income tax liability of self-employed persons. The intent of these provisions is to treat the self-employed in much the same manner as employees and employers are treated for purposes of FICA and income taxes. The first provision allows a deduction from net earnings from self-employment equal to the amount of net earnings before the deduction, times one-half the SECA tax rate. The effect of this deduction is intended to be analogous to the treatment of the FICA tax paid by the employer, which is disregarded as remuneration to the employee for FICA and income tax purposes. The second provision allows an income tax deduction, equal to one-half of the amount of the SECA tax paid, which is designed to reflect the income tax deductibility of the employer's share of the FICA tax. Table 2.A5 describes income tax credits for 19841989 intended to cushion the impact of increases in FICA and SECA taxes enacted in 1983. The SECA tax credits were replaced, effective 1990, by the deduction provisions described above. Table 2.A6 outlines the history of provisions regarding appropriations from general revenues and interfund borrowing.  Table 2.A1 outlines the history of coverage provisions and table 2.A2 provides a history of provisions regarding noncontributory wage credits, mostly for military service. For most employees, taxes are withheld from wages beginning with the first dollar earned. The exceptions are domestic employees, election workers, and agricultural workers. In 2002, a domestic employee must earn $1,300 from any single employer in a calendar year before FICA is withheld. Most election workers must earn $1,200 in 2002 before FICA is withheld. Most agricultural workers wages are covered if the employer pays more than $2,500 in total wages in a year or if the individual worker earns over $150 in a year from a single employer. Employees, their employers, and the self-employed each pay taxes on earnings in covered employment and self-employment up to an annual maximum taxable amount for OASDI. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). The OASDI maximum taxable amount--$84,900 in 2002--is updated automatically each year in relation to increases in the national average annual wage. The current FICA tax rate applicable to both employees and employers is 6.2 percent for OASDI (5.30 percent for OASI and 0.9 percent for DI), and 1.45 percent for HI. See Table 2.A3 for annual amounts of maximum taxable earnings and contribution rates. Table 2.A4 shows historical annual maximum amounts of contributions by employees and self-employed persons. 0  Insured Status To become eligible for his or her benefit and benefits for family members or survivors, a worker must earn a minimum number of credits based on work in covered employment or self-employment. These credits are described as quarters of coverage. In 2002, a quarter of coverage (QC) is credited for each $870 in annual covered earnings, up to a maximum of four QCs for the year. Earnings of $3,480 or more in 2002 will give the worker four QCs regardless of when the money is actually earned or paid during the year. The amount of earnings required for a QC is adjusted automatically each year in proportion to increases in the average wage level. Fully Insured Eligibility for most types of benefits requires that the worker be fully insured. To be fully insured a worker must have a number of QCs at least equal to the number of calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950 if later) and the year in which he or she reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies--whichever occurs first. Under this requirement, workers who reach age 62 in 1991 or later need the maximum number of 40 QCs to be fully insured. For workers who become disabled or die before age 62, the number of QCs needed for fully insured status depends on their age at the time the worker is disabled or dies. A minimum of 6 QCs is required regardless of age.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  11   Social Security Currently Insured If a worker dies before achieving fully insured status, benefits can still be paid to qualified survivors if the worker was ""currently insured"" at the time of death. (In the case of a young worker, survivors benefits are potentially payable to a worker's children and to a widow(er) with children in care.) To be currently insured, the worker must have earned 6 QCs in the 12 quarters before death (that is, 6 of the last 13 quarters, including the quarter in which death occurred). Disability Insured To qualify for disability benefits, a nonblind worker must have recent work activity as well as being fully insured. Under the test involving recent work experience, a nonblind worker older than age 31 must have earned at least 20 QCs among the 40 calendar quarters ending with the quarter in which the disability began. Workers disabled at ages 24 through 30 must have earned QCs in one-half of the calendar quarters elapsing between age 21 and the calendar quarter in which the disability began. Workers under age 24 need 6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with the quarter of disability onset. Workers who qualify for benefits based on blindness need only be fully insured. Table 2.A7 summarizes the basic provisions concerning insured status. Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Each agreement includes rules that assign a worker's coverage to only one country. The second goal of the agreement is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers and their family members may qualify for a partial U.S. benefit based on ""totalized"" (that is, combined) credits from both countries. Similarly, workers may qualify for partial benefits from the foreign country based on totalized credits. Table 5.M1 shows the number of beneficiaries receiving totalization payments and their average benefits.  Benefit Computation and Automatic Adjustment Provisions The primary insurance amount (PIA) is the monthly benefit amount payable to the worker upon retirement at full retirement age or upon entitlement to disability benefits. The PIA is also the base figure from which monthly benefit amounts payable to the worker's family members or survivors are determined. The PIA is derived from the worker's annual taxable earnings, averaged over a period that encompasses most of the worker's adult years. Until the late 1970s, the average monthly wage (AMW) was the earnings measure generally used. For workers first eligible for benefits after 1978, average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) have replaced the AMW as the usually applicable earnings measure. The PIA computation based on AIME currently involves the following three steps: 1. Indexing of earnings. The worker's annual taxable earnings after 1950 are updated, or indexed, to reflect the general earnings level in the indexing year--the second calendar year before the year in which the worker is first eligible; that is, first reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies. Earnings in years after the indexing year are not indexed but instead are counted at their actual value. A worker's earnings for a given year are indexed by multiplying them by the following ratio (indexing factor): The average wage in the national economy for the indexing year, divided by the corresponding average wage figure for the year to be indexed.  International Agreements The President is authorized to enter into international Social Security agreements (also called ""totalization"" agreements) to coordinate the U.S. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program with comparable programs of other countries. The United States currently has Social Security agreements in effect with 20 countries. Social Security Agreements and Effective Dates Australia ................. Austria ....................

Table 2.A9 shows indexed earnings for workers first eligible in 19952002 who had maximum taxable earnings in each year after 1950. For a detailed description of an AIME computation, see Appendix D, ""Computing a Retired-Worker Benefit."" 2. Determining AIME. The period used to calculate AIME equals the number of full calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950, if later) and the year of first eligibility, usually excluding the lowest 5 years. Workers disabled before age 47 have from zero to 4 excluded years from the computation. At an absolute minimum, 2 years are used to compute AIME. The actual years used in the computation (the ""computation years"") are the years of highest indexed earnings after 1950, including any years before age 22 or after age 61 as well as the year of disability or death. AIME is calculated as the sum of indexed earnings in the computation period, divided by the number of months in that period. Table 2.A10 provides a historical outline of provisions related to AIME and AMW, and describes variations in the number of dropout years. Tables 2.A15 and 2.A16 describe AMW benefit computations based on the worker's nonindexed earnings after 1936 and 1950, respectively. (Very few persons currently being awarded benefits have PlAs computed under these old-start or new-start computation methods. These methods, particularly the new-start method shown in Table 2.A16, are more frequently applicable in earnings recomputations for workers who reached age 62 before 1979.) 3. Computing the PIA. The formula used to compute the PIA from AIME is weighted to provide a higher PIA-toAIME ratio for workers with comparatively low earnings. The formula applies declining percentage conversion rates to three AIME brackets. For workers who reach age 62, become disabled, or die in 2002, the formula provides a PIA equal to the sum of: 90 percent of the first $592 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $2,975 of AIME, plus 15 percent of AIME over $3,567. Beginning with the first year of eligibility, the PIA is increased by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). 0 0  Table 2.A11 shows the PIA formula and first applicable COLA for workers first eligible in 1979 or later.  The dollar amounts defining the AIME brackets are referred to as ""bend points."" These bend points (as described in Table 2.A11) are updated automatically each year in proportion to increases in the national average wage level. This automatic adjustment ensures that benefit levels for successive generations of eligible workers will keep up with rising earnings levels, thereby assuring consistent rates of earnings replacement from one generation of beneficiaries to the next. The benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of eligibility (or death) rather than on the year benefits are first received. Thus the PIA of a worker retiring at age 65 in 2002 is calculated using the benefit formula that applies to all workers first eligible in 1999 (the ""year of attainment"" of age 62). The PIA derived from that formula is then increased by the COLAs effective for December, 1999, 2000, and 2001 to obtain the PIA effective at age 65. Subsequent recomputations of the worker's benefit, including additional earnings not originally considered, delayed retirement credits or additional COLA increases, all refer to the basic computation that originally applied, based on the year of attainment. Beginning in 1981, benefits have been rounded to the next lower ten cents at each step in the computation. The final benefit payment is rounded to the next lower dollar amount (if not already an even dollar). Prior to 1981, benefits were paid in ten-cent increments after rounding up to the next dime in each computation step. A cost-of-living increase in benefits generally is established each year if the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), prepared by the Department of Labor, indicates a percentage increase (after rounding) of at least 0.1 percent between two specified quarters. The arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for July, August, and September in the year of determination is compared with the arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for the later of (a) July, August, and September in the year in which the last effective cost-of-living increase was established or (b) the 3 months of the calendar quarter in which the effective month of the last general benefit increase occurred. The percentage increase in the CPI-W, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent, represents the size of the increase in benefits, effective for December of the year in which the determination is made. Under certain conditions, depending on the size of the combined OASDI trust funds relative to estimated disbursements, the applicability and size of a cost-of-living adjustment may be determined under an alternative method, called the ""stabilizer provision."" In no case, however, are benefits reduced below the level of benefits in the year of determination. Historically, this provision has never been triggered.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  13   Social Security Table 2.A18 presents a history of provisions relating to the automatic adjustment of benefits, including a description of the stabilizer provision. In addition, the Table includes a summary history and description of provisions relating to the annual automatic adjustment of (1) the maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, (2) the dollar amount needed to establish a quarter of coverage, (3) the bend points defining the AIME brackets in the PIA formula and the PIA brackets in the maximum family benefit formula, and (4) the exempt amounts under the earnings (retirement) test. All of these adjustments are linked to increases in the level of the national average annual wage, rather than to increases in the CPI. Table 2.A19 illustrates the cumulative effect of statutory and automatic increases in benefits for workers who have been in benefit status over varying time periods. Alternative PIA Computation Provisions Special minimum PIA. Workers with low earnings but steady attachment to the workforce over most of their adult years may qualify for monthly benefits based on the special minimum PIA computation. This computation does not depend on the worker's average earnings, but on the number of coverage years--years in which the worker had earnings equal to or above a specified amount. The level of the special minimum PIA is the same for workers having the same number of coverage years, regardless of age or year of first eligibility. Increases in the special minimum PIA are linked to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). See Table 2.A12 for additional information on the special minimum PIA. Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The WEP affects persons who receive a pension based on noncovered work after 1956 and Social Security benefits. First eligibility for the noncovered pension and Social Security benefits must be after December 31, 1985 for WEP to apply. WEP reduces the Social Security PIA upon which SSA benefits are based and affects all benefits paid on that record, except survivors. The WEP reduction ceases when entitlement to the pension payment ends, the wage earner dies, or the wage earner earns a total of 30 years of substantial Social Security earnings. The WEP reduction amount is never more than one-half of the noncovered pension. A WEP PIA is generally based on 40 percent of the first bend point instead of 90 percent as with the regular PIA: Example: A retired worker with a noncovered pension of $2,000 a month and less than 20 years of covered employment attains age 62 in 2002. 0  Normal PIA, based on AIME of $800. $592 x .90 = $532.80 $208 x .32 = $66.56 PIA = $599.30 WEP PIA, based on AIME of $800. $592 x .40 = $236.80 $208 x .32 = $66.56 PIA = $303.30 If a worker has more than 20 years of substantial covered earnings, the WEP PIA begins to increase. With the 21st year of substantial covered earnings, the first bend point percentage is increased by 5 percentage points. This rate of increase applies for each additional year of substantial covered earnings, through the 30th year of substantial earnings at which point WEP no longer applies. After 23 years of substantial coverage, for example, the first bend point percentage would be 55 percent. Thirty years of substantial earnings would yield a first bend point percentage of 90 percent (the normal percentage of the first bend point). Examples of pensions subject to WEP are U.S. Civil Service Retirement System annuities, retirement benefits based on foreign earnings, and state and local pensions based on noncovered earnings. Table 2.A11.1 provides more detail about the WEP computation and contains the amounts of substantial earnings for years after 1990. Substantial earnings for earlier years are listed in Table 2.A12. Family maximum provisions. Monthly benefits payable to the worker and family members or to the worker's survivors are subject to a maximum family benefit amount. The family maximum level for retired-worker families or survivor families usually ranges from 150 percent to 188 percent of the worker's PIA. The maximum benefit for disabled-worker families is the smaller of 85 percent of AIME (or 100 percent of PIA, if larger) or 150 percent of the PIA. Like the formula for determining the PIA, the maximum family benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of first eligibility (that is, the year of attainment of age 62, onset of disability, or death). Once the worker's maximum family benefit amount for the year of first eligibility is determined, it is updated in line with the COLAs. For information on family maximum provisions, as described here, see Table 2.A13 (comparison of family maximums to the PIAs on which they are based), and Table 2.A14 (disability family maximums). Table 2.A17 shows the maximum family benefit amounts applicable in cases of first eligibility before 1979.  14  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security  Benefit Types and Levels Retired and Disabled Workers The full retirement age (FRA) is the earliest age at which an unreduced retirement benefit is payable (sometimes referred to as the ""normal retirement age""). The age for full retirement benefits is scheduled to rise gradually from age 65 to age 67, with the first incremental increase affecting workers who reached age 62 in the year 2000. Workers over age 62 who retire before FRA can receive reduced benefits. The monthly rate of reduction from the full retirement benefit (that is, the PIA) is 5/9 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA. The reduction rate is 5/12 of 1 percent a month for any additional months. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age. If a disabled worker receives a reduced retirement benefit for months before disability entitlement, the disability benefit is reduced by the number of months for which he or she received the reduced benefit. For workers who postpone their retirement beyond the full retirement age, benefits are increased for each month of nonpayment beyond that age and age 70. This increase is called a ""delayed retirement credit,"" and is potentially available for any or all months following attainment of the full retirement age (maximum of 60 months for persons who attained age 65 prior to 2003). The annual rate of increase for delayed retirement credits is 7 percent for workers who reach age 62 in 2001 and 2002, and will eventually rise to 8 percent for workers reaching age 62 in 2005 or later. Spouses and Children of Workers Spouses receive 50 percent of the worker's PIA (regardless of the worker's actual benefit amount), if the spouse has attained the full retirement age at entitlement to spousal benefits. The spouse of a retired or disabled worker can elect monthly benefits as early as age 62. These benefits are reduced at the rate of 25/36 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA and 5/12 of 1 percent for each additional month. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 25 percent to 35 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age (FRA) for spouses attaining age 62 in that year. Children of retired or disabled workers are also eligible to receive monthly benefits. The term ""child"" refers to a child under the age of 18, a child aged 1819 attending elementary or secondary school full time, or to an adult child, aged 18 or older, who was disabled prior to age 22. In addition, young spouses (that is, those under the age of 62) who care for a worker's entitled child may also be eligible. For purposes of defining young spouses' benefits, the term  ""child"" refers to a child under age 16, or to an adult child of the worker who was disabled prior to age 22. Children of retired or disabled workers can receive up to 50 percent of the worker's PIA, as can young spouses. (The benefit of a young spouse is not reduced for age.) Monthly benefits payable to the spouse and children of a retired or disabled worker are limited to a family maximum amount, as discussed earlier. Benefits are payable to unmarried divorced spouses of retirement age who were married at least 10 years to the worker. A divorced spouse benefit is excluded from family maximum provisions. Divorced spouses age 62 or older and divorced for 2 or more years (after marriage of 10 or more years) may be independently entitled on the record of the ex-spouse if the ex-spouse could be entitled if he or she applied. Survivors Benefits Widows and widowers of fully insured workers are eligible for unreduced benefits at full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. As with retired workers and spouses, widow(er)s' FRA will gradually increase to age 67. Widows and widowers can elect reduced monthly benefits at age 60 or, if disabled, as early as age 50. Surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits if married to the worker for at least 10 years and not remarried before age 60 (age 50 if disabled). For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is 65, the monthly rate of reduction for the first 60 months immediately preceding FRA is 19/40 of 1 percent of the worker's PIA, with a maximum reduction of 28.5 percent at age 60. For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is over 65, the amount of reduction for each month prior to FRA is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the maximum reduction at age 60 remains 28.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Benefits for widows and widowers are increased if the deceased worker delayed retirement beyond the FRA. In these cases, the survivor benefits include any delayed retirement credits the deceased worker had earned. Conversely, if the worker had elected early retirement, widow(er)s' benefits are limited for widow(er)s first entitled to survivors benefits at age 62 or later. For these beneficiaries, the benefit is the higher of 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA or the amount the worker would be receiving if still alive. Disabled widow(er)s ages 5060 receive the age 60 widow's rate (71.5 percent of PIA) regardless of their age at the time of entitlement. Children of deceased workers and mothers and fathers under FRA are eligible to receive monthly benefits up to 75 percent of the worker's PIA if the worker died either fully or currently insured. Mothers and fathers must be caring for the worker's entitled child who is either under age 16 or disabled. A dependent parent aged 62 or older is eligible for monthly benefits equal to 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Each of two dependent parents can qualify for benefits  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  15   Social Security equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA. Monthly benefits payable to survivors are reduced to conform to the family maximum benefit payable on the deceased worker's account. Benefits for a surviving divorced spouse, however, are disregarded when computing the maximum family benefit. See Table 2.A20 for more information on the increases in the full (or normal) retirement age for workers. Table 2.A21 describes age-related reductions for dependent beneficiaries, as does Table 2.A22 (widow(er)s). Additionally, Tables 2.A23 and 2.A24 show the history of legislation relating to special monthly benefits payable to certain persons born before January 2, 1900. Table 2.A25 summarizes the history of certain OASDI benefits other than monthly benefit payments. Table 2.A26 presents illustrative monthly benefit amounts for selected beneficiary families, based on hypothetical earnings histories representing five different earnings levels. Table 2.A27 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 62 in various years beginning with 1957 (the first full year benefits became available at age 62). Table 2.A28 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 65 in various years beginning with 1940. Provisions for Railroad Retirement Board Beneficiaries The OASDI tables do not include a number of persons receiving Railroad Retirement benefits who would be eligible for Social Security benefits had they applied. The reason they have not applied is that receipt of a Social Security benefit would reduce their Railroad Retirement benefit by a like amount. The number of persons is not available, but is estimated to be less than 100,000. The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, effective January 1, 1975, provided that the regular annuity for employees with 10 or more years of railroad service who retired after December 31, 1974, will consist of two components. Public Law 107-90 (the 2001 amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974) effective January 1, 2002 revised the railroad service work requirement. The railroad service work requirement is 10 or more years of railroad service or, effective January 1, 2002, have at least 5 years of railroad service after December 31, 1995. The two components are unchanged:  Tier 1. A basic Social Security level component equivalent to what would be paid under the Social Security Act on the basis of the employee's combined railroad and nonrailroad service, reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit under OASDI actually paid on the basis of nonrailroad work; and  Tier 2. A ""private pension"" component payable over and above the Social Security equivalent, calculated on the basis of the number of years of railroad service.  Effect of Current Earnings on Benefits Beneficiaries under the full retirement age (FRA) with earnings in excess of certain exempt amounts may have all or part of their benefits withheld as a result of the annual earnings test (AET) provisions of the Social Security Act. For those at or above FRA, however, there have been recent changes to AET provisions. Amendments in 1996 eased the impact of AET provisions, while changes in 2000 removed the AET altogether for beneficiaries aged 65 or older. Public Law 104- 121, enacted March 29, 1996, substantially raised the exempt amounts under the annual earnings test for persons who have reached full retirement age. These amounts are $12,500 in 1996; $13,500 in 1997; $14,500 in 1998; $15,500 in 1999; $17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 in benefits for every $3 of earnings above the FRA exempt amount. Public Law 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000, eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches FRA. The annual earnings test that applies in the year one attains FRA is based on the more generous annual limits established under P.L. 104-121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). After 2002, the annual exempt amount will be indexed to the growth in average wages. In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be counted. Public Laws 104-121 and 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year. This annual amount continues to be pegged to increases in average wages. The amount was $10,680 in 2001, and is $11,280 in 2002. When the annual earnings limit affects working beneficiaries under FRA, benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. Individuals have the option to receive reduced benefits under a monthly earnings test if it is to their advantage to do so. This option is usually exercised in the first year of retirement, because in that year the monthly test permits payment for some months even if the annual earnings limit is greatly exceeded. Under the monthly test, beneficiaries receive a full monthly benefit for months in which they do not earn over an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual earnings limit. The monthly earnings test is applied to the self-employed based on hours they work instead of monthly earnings. Generally, beneficiaries are eligible for the monthly earnings test in only one year.  16  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security Table 2.A29 provides historical detail on the retirement test. Beneficiaries entitled on the basis of their own disability--disabled workers, disabled adult children, and disabled widow(er)s--are not subject to the earnings test. Substantial earnings by disabled beneficiaries, however, may indicate that they are able to do work which constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are therefore no longer disabled. Although other factors are considered, numerical earnings thresholds are used in a determination of SGA. Table 2.A30 provides historical thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA). Table 2.A31 shows the history of provisions related to taxation of Social Security benefits. Table 2.A32 offers examples to illustrate when benefits are taxable and the amount subject to taxation. CONTACT: Curt Pauzenga (410) 965-7210 or Joseph Bondar (410) 965-0162.  Taxation of Benefits Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on the beneficiary's income, marital status, and filing status. The definition of income for this provision is as follows: Adjusted gross income (before Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are considered), plus tax-exempt interest income, with further modification of adjusted gross income in some cases involving certain tax provisions of limited applicability among the beneficiary population; plus onehalf of Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits. For married beneficiaries filing jointly with adjusted gross income under $32,000 a year, no Social Security benefits are subject to taxation. If adjusted gross income exceeds $32,000 but is under $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of one-half of income over $32,000. If a couple's adjusted gross income exceeds $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is 85 percent of income over $44,000 plus the lesser of $6,000 or one-half of benefits. However, no more than 85 percent of benefits are subject to income tax. The income thresholds for single beneficiaries are $25,000 and $32,000. If members of a married couple are filing separately, they do not have a minimum threshold if they lived together any time during the tax year. The amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits, or 85 percent of all income as defined above. Like all matters dealing with tax liability, taxation of Social Security benefits fall under the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  17   Supplemental Security Income The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, provides income support to persons aged 65 or older, blind or disabled adults, and blind or disabled children. Eligibility requirements and federal payment standards are nationally uniform. The 2002 federal SSI benefit rate for an individual living in his or her own household and with no other countable income is $545 monthly; for a couple (with both husband and wife eligible), the SSI benefit rate is $817 monthly. Payments under SSI began in January 1974 . It replaced the former federal-state adult assistance programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Under SSI each eligible person is provided a monthly cash payment based on a statutory federal benefit rate. Since 1975, these rates have been increased by the same percentage, as the cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefits. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and is receiving both food and shelter from the person in whose household they are living, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third. This is done instead of determining the actual dollar value of the in-kind support and maintenance. For institutionalized persons, the eligibility requirements and payment standards depend on the type of institution. With some exceptions, inmates of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. For persons institutionalized for a complete calendar month, a maximum federal SSI payment of $30 per month applies where (1) the institution receives a substantial part of the cost of the person's care from the Medicaid program, or (2) recipients under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution,. Other eligible persons in institutions may receive up to the full federal benefit rate. The federal payment is based on the individual's countable income. The first $20 monthly in OASDI benefits or other earned or unearned income is not counted. Also excluded is $65 monthly of earnings plus one-half of any earnings above $65. For example, a person living in his or her own household, whose sole income is a $200 monthly OASDI benefit, would receive $365 in federal SSI payments: $545 - ($200 - $20) = ($545 - $180) = $365. A person whose income consists of $500 in gross monthly earnings would receive $337.50 in federal SSI payments: $545 - (($500 - $85) / 2) = $207.50 countable earnings FBR $545 -$207.50 = $337.50 federal SSI Individuals generally are not eligible for SSI if they have resources in excess of $2,000 (or $3,000 for a couple). Certain resources are excluded, most commonly a home, an automobile, and household goods and personal effects of reasonable value. States have the option to supplement the federal SSI payment for all or selected categories of persons, regardless of previous state program eligibility. CONTACT: Lenna D.

Aged: Any person aged 65 or older. Blind: Any person with 20/200 or less vision in the better eye with the use of correcting lenses, or with tunnel vision of 20 degrees or less. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Blind (AB) program is eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of blindness. Disabled: Any person unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. For a child under age 18, eligibility is based on disability of severity comparable with that of an adult. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) program to SSI is also eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of disability. 1973 Public Law 93-233, enacted December 31 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Only persons who had received APTD before July 1973 and were on the rolls in December 1973 may receive SSI on the basis of the state definition of disability; those who became eligible for state aid from July to December 1973 must meet the federal definition of disability. A disabled recipient who loses federal SSI eligibility because of earnings at the substantial gainful activity level may continue to receive a special benefit under section 1619 and retain eligibility for Medicaid under title XIX of the Social Security Act. This special benefit status may continue as long as the recipient has the disabling impairment and meets all nondisability SSI eligibility criteria. States have the option of supplementing this special benefit. This provision of the law was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Beginning in January 1984, under a 1-year demonstration project, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for either regular SSI payments or special monthly benefits. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 legislation were extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 amendments are made permanent. The provisions were amended effective July 1, 1987, with significant modifications to simplify administration and to allow free movement between regular SSI disability payments and either the special cash benefit or Medicaid eligibility under section 1619. The distinction between a disabled person eligible for regular SSI payments and one eligible for 1619(a) is that the latter has several months with gross earnings above the SGA level. Previously, section 1619(a) status required completion of a trial work period and the determination that the work was SGA. For individuals under age 18, the ""comparable severity"" standard is eliminated and replaced with a requirement that a child be considered disabled if he/she has a medically determinable impairment that results in ""marked and severe functional limitations,"" and meets the  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  19   SSI: History of Provisions existing statutory duration requirement. The law also eliminates references to ""maladaptive behaviors"" in the Listing of Impairments for children, and discontinues the use of individualized functional assessments for children. SSI eligibility is prohibited for an individual in any month during which such an individual is a fugitive felon, fleeing prosecution, or violating state or federal conditions of probation or parole. In addition, SSI eligibility is prohibited for 10 years for those convicted of fraudulently claiming residence to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more states.a  Other Eligibility Provisions Citizenship and Residence 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 The individual must reside within izen or an alien lawfully admitted United States under color of law. dar month lose their eligibility for one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and be a citfor permanent residence or permanently residing in the Persons living outside the United States for an entire calensuch a month.  1976 Public Law 94-241, enacted March 24 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Eligibility for SSI is extended to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands, effective January 9, 1978. The income and resources of the immigration sponsors of aliens applying for SSI are considered in determining eligibility for and the amount of payment. After allowances for the needs of the sponsor and his/her family, the remainder is deemed available for the support of the alien applicant for a 3-year period after admission to the United States for permanent residence. This provision does not apply to those who become blind or disabled after admission, to refugees, or to persons granted political asylum. (See ""Deeming of Income and Resources"" on page 30 for subsequent changes to sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions.) SSI eligibility is continued for a disabled or blind child who was receiving SSI benefits while living in the United States and is now living with a parent who is a member of the U.S. armed forces assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States, but not where the parent is stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Above provision made applicable where the parent is a member of the U.S. armed forces and stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Prohibits SSI eligibility for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national unless they are in a ""qualified alien"" category and meet one of certain exceptions such as lawful permanent residents who earn or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of earnings, certain refugee type categories eligible for up to 5 years of time-limited eligibility, or active duty U.S. military or veterans and their spouses and children. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996 (the enactment date of the law) for 1 year after the enactment date for those aliens found ineligible under the new standards.  1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  a  This last provision was repealed in 1999 by Public Law 106-169 and replaced with a provision providing for nonpayment of benefits for up to 24 months for making false or misleading statements regarding material facts.  20  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30 1997 Public Law 105-18, enacted June 12 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-193 to add to the list of ""qualified aliens"" certain noncitizens (and their children) who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent or a member of the spouse's or parent's family living in the same household. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1997, for those found ineligible under the new alien standards of Public Law 104-193. Further amends Public Law 104-193 to add Cuban and Haitian entrants, and the child of a parent who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, to the list of qualified aliens. Provides that Cuban and Haitian entrants and Amerasian immigrants qualify for time limited eligibility, and increases the time limit from 5 to 7 years for all time-limited categories. Additional exceptions are added for qualified aliens: (1) lawfully residing in the United States and receiving SSI benefits on August 22, 1996; and (2) lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996 and meeting the definition of blind or disabled in the Social Security Act. Certain noncitizen American Indians are excepted from the alien nonpayment provisions of Public Law 104-193. Extends eligibility for ""nonqualified aliens"" receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1998. 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 2000 Public Law 106-386, enacted October 28 Permanently extends eligibility of all remaining ""nonqualified aliens"" who were receiving SSI benefits when Public Law 104-193 was enacted on August 22, 1996. Noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, may be eligible for SSI to the same extent as refugees, if they are determined to be victims of ""severe forms of trafficking in persons.""  Other Benefits 1980 Public Law 96-272, enacted June 17 SSI applicants and recipients are not required as a condition of eligibility to elect to receive Veterans Administration pensions under the Veterans and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 if the state of residence lacks a medically needy program under title XIX.  Drug Addiction and Alcoholism (DA&A) 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Any disabled individual who has been medically determined to be an alcoholic or drug addict must accept appropriate treatment, if available, in an approved facility and demonstrate compliance with conditions and requirements for treatment. SSI payments are required to be made through a representative payee--another person or public or private agency designated by SSA to manage the recipient's benefit on his/her behalf. 1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15 Any individual who is receiving SSI based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability must comply with the DA&A treatment requirements. The individual must accept appropriate treatment when it is available and comply with the conditions and terms of treatment. Instances of noncompliance with the requirements result in progressively longer payment suspensions. Before payments can resume, the individual must demonstrate compliance for specific periods; 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, for the first, second, third and subsequent instances of noncompliance. An individual who is not in compliance with the DA&A treatment require-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  21   SSI: History of Provisions ments for 12 consecutive months shall not be eligible for payments; however, this does not prevent such individuals from reapplying and again becoming eligible for payments. SSI disability payments based on DA&A are also limited to a total of 36 benefit months (beginning March 1995) regardless of whether appropriate treatment is available. Months for which benefits are not due and received do not count towards the 36-month limit. Payments based on DA&A must be made to a representative payee. Preference is required to be given to community based nonprofit social service agencies and federal, state, or local government agencies in representative payee selection. These agencies when serving as payees for individuals receiving payments based on DA&A may retain the lesser of 10 percent of the monthly benefit or $57 (indexed to the consumer price index (CPI)) as compensation for their services. Establishment of one or more referral and monitoring agencies for each state is required. 1996 Public Law 104-121, enacted March 29 An individual is not considered disabled if DA&A is a contributing factor material to a finding of disability. Applies DA&A representative payee requirements enacted under Public Law 103-296 to disabled SSI recipients who have a DA&A condition and are incapable of managing their benefits. In addition, these recipients shall be referred to the appropriate state agency administering the state plan for substance abuse treatment.  Institutionalization 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 An individual who is an inmate of a public institution is ineligible for SSI payments unless the institution is a facility approved for Medicaid payments and is receiving such payments on behalf of the person. Under regulations, the Medicaid payment must represent more than 50 percent of the cost of services provided by the facility to the individual. An inmate of a publicly operated community residence serving no more than 16 persons may, if otherwise eligible, receive SSI. Payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless for a period of up to 3 months in any 12-month period. Effective July 1, 1987, disabled or blind recipients who were receiving special SSI payments or had special SSI recipient status under section 1619 in the month preceding the first full month of institutionalization, may receive payments based on the full federal benefit rate for the initial 2 full months of institutionalization, if they reside in certain public medical, psychiatric or Medicaid facilities, or in private Medicaid facilities. Effective January 1, 1988, payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless, for up to 6 months in a 9-month period. Effective July 1, 1988, continued payment of SSI benefits for up to 3 months is permitted, at the rate that was applicable in the month prior to the first full month of institutionalization, for individuals whose expected institutional stay on admission is not likely to exceed 3 months, as certified by a physician, and for whom the receipt of benefits is necessary to maintain living arrangements to which they may return.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Effective December 1996, institutionalized children under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution may receive no more than $30 per month in federal SSI.  Vocational Rehabilitation and Treatment 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 Blind or disabled individuals receiving federal SSI benefits who are under age 65, must be referred to the state agency providing services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and must accept the services offered. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Blind or disabled children under age 16 must be referred to the state agency administering crippled children's services or to another agency designated by the state. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Of funds provided for these services, at least 90 percent must be used for children under age 6 or for those who have never attended public schools. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Disabled SSI recipients who medically recover while enrolled in approved vocational rehabilitation programs of state VR agencies, may continue to receive benefits during their participation in such programs if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that continuation in the program will increase the probability that they leave the rolls permanently. Funding no longer provided under title XVI for medical, social, developmental and rehabilitative services to disabled or blind children. Reimbursement for the cost of rehabilitation services will be made if the services result in the recipient's return to work. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 Authorizes the reimbursement of states for the cost of VR services provided to individuals who (1) continue to receive benefits after medical recovery because they are participating in a state VR program or (2) refuse, without good cause, to continue in or cooperate with the VR program in which they had been participating. Provision for continuation of payments to SSI recipients who have medically recovered while enrolled in an approved vocational rehabilitation program extended to blind SSI recipients. Reimbursement authorized for the cost of vocational rehabilitation services provided in months in which the individual was not receiving federal SSI payments, if:  1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5   SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes was retained under work incentive provisions, or   Benefits were in suspense b status (for a reason other than cessation of disability or blindness), or   Federally administered state supplementation was received.  b  Recipients who have lost eligibility for SSI benefits for fewer than 13 consecutive months are in suspended payment status.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  23   SSI: History of Provisions Extends the provision providing for benefit continuation to SSI recipients who medically recover while participating in a state VR program to include SSI recipients participating in a non-state VR program. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program which will provide SSI (and OASDI) disability beneficiaries with a ticket that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, from an employment network of their choice.  Continuing Disability Reviews and Eligibility Redeterminations 1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15 During each of fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, requires SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDRs) on a minimum of 100,000 SSI recipients. In addition, during the same period, requires SSA to redetermine the SSI eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Redeterminations for persons turning age 18 could count toward the 100,000 CDR requirement. Repeals the requirement that SSA redetermine the eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Requires a CDR:  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22   At least once every 3 years for SSI recipients under age 18 who are eligible by reason of an impairment which is likely to improve, and   Not later than 12 months after birth for recipients whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of their disability. Requires eligibility redetermination for all childhood SSI recipients eligible for the month before the month in which they attain age 18. Requires redetermination of eligibility for children considered disabled based on an individual functional assessment and/or consideration of maladaptive behavior. Requires the representative payee of a childhood disability recipient whose continuing eligibility is being reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is receiving treatment which is considered medically necessary and available for the condition which was the basis for providing SSI benefits. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to extend from 12 to 18 months the period for redetermining the disability of children under age 18 under the new childhood disability standard. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to permit SSA to schedule a CDR for a disabled child for whom low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, at a date after the child's first birthday if the Commissioner determines the impairment is not expected to improve within 12 months of the child's birth. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to provide SSA the authority to make redeterminations of disabled childhood recipients who attain age 18, more than 1 year after the date such recipient attains age 18. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Prohibits the initiation of a CDR during the period that a recipient is ""using a ticket"" under the Ticket to Work program.  24  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions  Deeming of Income and Resources 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Deeming occurs when the income and resources of certain family members living in the same household with the SSI recipient are considered in determining the amount of the SSI payment. These family members are the ineligible spouse of an adult recipient and the ineligible parents of a child recipient under age 21. After deduction of personal allocations for the spouse (or parents) and for ineligible children in the home, and after application of income exclusions, any remaining income of the spouse (or parents) is added to the income of the eligible person. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19 Children aged 18 or older are not subject to parental deeming. Sponsor 's income and resources deemed to an alien for 3 years. Disabled children receiving home care services under state Medicaid programs, who are ineligible for SSI because of deeming of parental income, and who received SSI benefits limited to $30 while in a medical treatment facility, may receive the $30 monthly allowance that would be payable if the recipient were institutionalized. Sponsor-to-alien deeming period extended from 3 years to 5 years, effective January 1, 1994, through September 30, 1996. Considers an ineligible spouse or parent who is absent from the household due to active military service to be a member of the household for deeming purposes. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Deeming of income and resources from an immigration sponsor to a noncitizen continues until citizenship, with exceptions for those who earn, or can be credited with, 40 qualifying quarters of earnings. Effective for those whose sponsor signs a new legally enforceable affidavit of support. Amends Public Law 104-193 to add two exceptions to the sponsor-to-alien deeming:  1993 Public Law 103-152, enacted November 24  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30   Provides that if the noncitizen is indigent and would be unable to obtain food and shelter without SSI benefits even after receiving support from the sponsor, then only the amount of income and resources actually provided by the sponsor will be counted for a 12-month period after a determination of indigence; and   Provides that in certain cases, deeming would not apply for a 12-month period (with some options for extension) if the noncitizen (or his/her children) has been battered, or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-208 to add an additional exception to sponsor-to-alien deeming when the parent of a noncitizen has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members.  Federal Benefit Payments Federal Benefit Rates Basic benefit standards are used in computing the amount of federal SSI payments. Benefit levels differ for individuals and couples living in households and for persons in Medicaid institutions. Individuals or couples living in their own households receive the full federal benefit. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and receiving support and  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  25   SSI: History of Provisions maintenance there, the federal benefit is reduced by one-third. The federal benefit rates for persons in households are increased annually to reflect increases in the cost of living. Legislation affecting the level of federal benefit rates since the inception of the SSI program are summarized in table 2.B1.  Windfall Offset 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1984 Public Law 98-617, enacted November 8 Offset (by reduction of retroactive Social Security benefits) to prevent persons whose initial OASDI payment is retroactive from receiving more in total benefits for the same period than if they were paid the benefits when regularly due. Offset provision expanded to allow for reduction of retroactive SSI benefits and to apply in cases of OASDI benefit reinstatement.  Proration of Benefit 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Benefit for first month of eligibility to be prorated by the number of days in the month for which an application has been filed and there is eligibility. Changes the effective date of an SSI application to the first day of the month following the date on which the application was filed or on which the individual first becomes eligible, whichever is later. This, in effect, eliminates prorated payments in initial claims.  Retrospective Monthly Accounting 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to one under which the benefit amount is computed on a monthly basis and is based on income and other characteristics in the previous (or second previous) month. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving title II payments. The effect of the increased title II income at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Provides an exception to retrospective monthly accounting so that amounts received under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), foster care, refugee cash assistance, Cuban-Haitian entrant assistance, or general and child welfare assistance provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are counted only in the month received. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving the value of the onethird reduction. The effect of the increased value at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Effective January 1995.  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  Uncashed Checks 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 States that have federally administered supplements to be credited their share of SSI checks that remain unnegotiated for 180 days.  26  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1987 Public Law 100-86, enacted August 10  SSI checks now unnegotiable after 1 year. States are credited their share of SSI checks after 1 year rather than 180 days.  Rounding of Payment Amounts 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 Cost-of-living adjustments in the federal SSI benefit and income eligibility levels are to be rounded to the next lower whole dollar, after the adjustment is calculated. Subsequent costof-living adjustments will be calculated on the previous year 's benefit standard before rounding.  Penalties Resulting in Nonpayment of Benefits for False or Misleading Statements 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Provides for the nonpayment of OASDI and for the first, second, and third or subsequen statement or representation of material fact the individual knew, or should have known, fact.

Earned income tax credit treated as earned income (temporarily excluded from 1975 through 1980). Remunerations received in sheltered workshops and work activity centers are considered earned income and qualify for earned income exclusions. Impairment-related work expenses paid by the individual (including cost for attendant care, medical equipment, drugs, and services necessary to control an impairment) are deducted from earnings when determining if an individual is engaging in substantial gainful activity. Impairment-related work expenses are excluded in calculating income for benefit purposes if initial eligibility for benefits exists on the basis of countable income without applying this exclusion. 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1982 Public Law 97-377, enacted December 21 1983 Public Law 97-424, enacted January 6 Modifies provision under which irregularly or infrequently received income is excluded to conform to change from quarterly to monthly accounting; amounts excludable: $20 or less of unearned income and $10 of earned income in a month.

Presumptive payment provision was extended to persons applying on the basis of blindness.  Extends the period for receipt of payments to 6 months.  Emergency Advance Payments 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Any applicant who can be presumed to meet the criteria of eligibility, but has not yet been determined eligible, and who is faced with a financial emergency may receive an immediate cash advance of up to $100. Increases the maximum emergency advance payment amount to the maximum amount of the regular federal SSI monthly benefit rate, plus, if any, the federally administered state supplementary payment. Applicants who have a financial emergency may receive an emergency advance payment in the month of application, which, effective with this law, is always prior to the first month of eligibility. These advance payments are recouped by proportional reductions in the recipient's first 6 months of SSI benefits.  Interim Assistance Reimbursement 1974 Public Law 93-368, enacted August 7 1976 Public Law 94-365, enacted July 14 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 SSA may enter into agreements with the states to repay them directly for assistance payments made to an SSI applicant while his/her claim is being adjudicated.

Extends interim assistance reimbursement to situations in which payments are made by states or political subdivisions to persons whose SSI payments were suspended or terminated and who subsequently are found to be eligible for such benefits. Also clarifies that the payment from which the interim assistance reimbursement is paid must be the first payment of benefits relating to the interim period.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  33   SSI: History of Provisions  Medicaid Eligibility 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States can provide Medicaid coverage to all recipients of SSI payments. Alternatively, they can limit coverage by applying more restrictive criteria from the state Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. States can accept SSA determination of eligibility, or make their own determination. 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for cash SSI payments due to the cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Blind or disabled recipients under age 65 no longer eligible for either regular or special SSI payments because of their earnings may retain SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes under the following conditions: (1) they continue to have the disabling impairment, (2) they meet all nondisability eligibility criteria except for earned income, (3) they would be seriously inhibited from continuing employment without Medicaid services, and (4) their earnings are insufficient to provide a reasonable equivalent of SSI payments and Medicaid. In states that do not provide Medicaid coverage categorically to all SSI recipients, qualification for Medicaid benefits depends on the state's specific eligibility and program requirements. The Medicaid provision of the 1980 legislation was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Under a 1-year demonstration project, beginning January 1, 1984, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for regular or special SSI payments or for retention of Medicaid eligibility. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-272, enacted April 7 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 Medicaid provision of 1980 legislation extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). Restores Medicaid eligibility for some disabled widow(er)s who became ineligible for SSI when their title II benefits increased in 1984 because of a change in the Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits reduction factor. The SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility provision of the 1980 amendments is made permanent. Effective July 1, 1987, certain expenses are excluded from earnings when determining sufficiency of earnings to establish SSI recipient status eligibility for Medicaid purposes:       Impairment-related work expenses of disabled persons, Work expenses of blind persons, Income required for achieving an approved self-support plan, and The value of publicly funded attendant care services.  Effective July 1, 1987, preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for SSI payments because of entitlement to, or an increase in, Social Security disabled adult child benefits on or after the effective date. Effective July 1, 1987, requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for recipients in special SSI status (either receiving special SSI payments or in the special recipient status described for 1980) if they received Medicaid coverage the month before special SSI status.  34  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  Effective July 1, 1988, restores or preserves the Medicaid eligibility of persons aged 60 or older who are eligible for Social Security benefits as widows or widowers (but not eligible for Medicare) and who become ineligible for SSI payments or state supplementation because of the receipt of old-age or survivors insurance benefits under Social Security. Age limit for retention of SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes (1980 and subsequent work incentive provisions, above) is eliminated. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of SSI recipients who become ineligible for payments when they become entitled to Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits following the revised definition used for their disability.  1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  Requires states to continue Medicaid payments as of August 22, 1996 and except that their eligibility terminated disability standard established under  coverage for disabled children who were receiving SSI would have continued to be eligible for such payments because they did not meet the revised SSI childhood Public Law 104-193.  State Supplementation 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States are given the option of providing supplementary payments both to recipients transferred from the state program and to those newly eligible for SSI. States may either administer the payments themselves or have the Social Security Administration make payments on their behalf. When state supplementary payments are federally administered, the Social Security Administration makes eligibility and payment determinations for the state and assumes administrative costs. ""Hold harmless"" protection, which limits a state's fiscal liability to its share of OAA, AB, and APTD expenditures for calendar year 1972, is provided to states electing federal administration of their supplementary plans. This provision applies only to supplementary payments that do not, on the average, exceed a state's ""adjusted payment level."" (The adjusted payment level is the average of the payments that individuals with no other income received in January 1972; it may include the bonus value of food stamps. Adjustments are provided for payments that had been below state standards.) 1973 Public Law 93-66, enacted July 9 Provision is made for mandatory state supplementation as assurance against reduction of income for persons who received state assistance in December 1973 and were transferred to SSI. These supplementary payments must equal the difference between (1) the amount of the state assistance payment that the individual received in December 1973 plus other income and (2) his/her federal SSI payment plus other income. After June 30, 1977, when the federal SSI payment level is increased by a cost-of-living increase, such an increase will be excluded in calculating the ""hold harmless"" amount. Requires states to maintain state supplementation payments at the level of December 1976 (""maintenance of payments"") or to continue to pay in supplements the same total annual amounts (""maintenance of expenditures"") when the federal SSI payment level is increased and thereby pass through any increases in federal benefits without reducing state supplements.  1976 Public Law 94-585, enacted October 21  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  35   SSI: History of Provisions 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20  Begins a 3-year phase out of ""hold harmless"" protection. Effective with fiscal year 1985, Wisconsin and Hawaii (the only remaining ""hold harmless"" states) assumed the full cost of their supplementary payments. Federal pass-through law is adjusted (1) by substituting the state supplementary payment levels in effect in March 1983 for those in effect in December 1976 as the levels that states must maintain in complying with the pass-through requirements, and (2) with regard to the $20 (individual) and $30 (couple) increase in the federal SSI standard in July 1983, by requiring states to pass through only as much as would have been required if the SSI cost-of-living adjustment had been made in July 1983. Provides for federal administration of state supplements to residents of medical institutions. Provides for required pass through of $5 increase in federal rate for persons whose care in institutions is paid in substantial part by Medicaid. Requires states to pay fees for federal administration of their state supplementation payments. The fees are $1.67 for each monthly supplementary payment in fiscal year 1994, $3.33 in fiscal year 1995, and $5.00 in fiscal year 1996. Fees for subsequent fiscal years will be $5.00 or another amount determined by the Commissioner to be appropriate. The Commissioner may charge the states additional fees for services they request that are beyond the level customarily provided in administering state supplementary payments. Revises the schedule of per-payment fees for federal administration of state supplementation for fiscal years 1998 ($6.20) through 2002 ($8.50) and provides a formula for determining the fee beyond fiscal year 2002. A state which has an agreement with SSA to administer its supplementation payments, must remit both payments and fees prior to the SSI payment date. Changes the effective date of above provision from 2009 to 2001.  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 2000 Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21  Overpayment Recovery 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 Limits the rate of recovering overpayments from monthly payments to the lesser of: (1) the monthly payment, or (2) 10 percent of a recipient's monthly income. Permits a higher or lower adjustment at the request of the recipient subject to the agreement of the Commissioner. The limit does not apply if fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the recipient or spouse in connection with the overpayment. Waives recovery of certain overpayments due to amount of excess resources of $50 or less. Provides temporary authority for the recovery of overpayments from tax refunds. 1988 Public Law 100-485, enacted October 13 Grants permanent authority to recover overpayments from tax refunds.  36  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14  Authorizes SSA to collect SSI overpayments by offsetting Social Security benefits, with a maximum monthly offset of no more than 10 percent of the Social Security benefit. Makes representative payees liable for an SSI overpayment caused by a payment made to a recipient who has died, and requires SSA to establish an overpayment control record under the representative payee's Social Security number. Requires SSA to recover SSI overpayments from SSI lump-sum amounts by withholding at least 50 percent of the lump-sum payment or the amount of the overpayment, whichever is less.

They should be used only as overviews and general guides to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the policies or legal positions of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These summaries do not render any legal, accounting, or other professional advice, nor are they intended to explain fully all of the provisions or exclusions of the relevant laws, regulations, and rulings of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Original sources of authority should be researched and utilized. care-only coverage in federal, state, or local government employment are eligible beginning at age 65. Similarly, individuals who have been entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability benefits for at least 24 months, and government employees with Medicare-only coverage who have been disabled for more than 29 months, are entitled to HI benefits. HI coverage is also provided to insured workers with ESRD (and to insured workers' spouses and children with ESRD), as well as to some otherwise ineligible aged and disabled beneficiaries who voluntarily pay a monthly premium for their coverage. In 2001, the HI program provided protection against the costs of hospital and specific other medical care to almost 40 million people (34 million aged and 6 million disabled enrollees). HI benefit payments totaled $141.2 billion in 2001. The following health care services are covered under Medicare's HI program:  Inpatient hospital care coverage includes costs of a semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating and recovery rooms, intensive care, inpatient prescription drugs, laboratory tests, X-rays, psychiatric hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, and longterm care (LTC) hospitalization when medically necessary, as well as all other medically necessary services and supplies provided in the hospital. An initial deductible payment is required of beneficiaries who are admitted to a hospital, plus copayments for all hospital days following day 60 within a benefit period (described later).  Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is covered by HI only if it follows within 30 days (generally) of a hospitalization of 3 days or more and is certified as medically necessary. Covered services are similar to those for inpatient hospital but also include rehabilitation services and appliances. The number of SNF days provided under Medicare is limited to 100 days per benefit period (described later), with a copayment required for days 21100. HI does not cover nursing facility care if the patient does not require skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation services.  Home health agency (HHA) care is covered by both HI and SMI. The BBA transferred from HI to SMI those home health services furnished on or after January 1, 1998 that are unassociated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. HI will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a 3-day hospital stay or a skilled nursing facility stay; SMI covers any visits thereafter. Home health care under HI and SMI has no copayment and no deductible. HHA care, including care provided by a home health aide, may be furnished part-time by a HHA in the residence of a home-bound beneficiary if intermittent or part-time skilled nursing and/or certain other therapy or rehabilitation  Overview Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, designated ""Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled,"" is commonly known as Medicare. As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, the Medicare legislation established a health insurance program for aged persons to complement the retirement, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. When first implemented in 1966, Medicare covered most persons age 65 or older. In 1973, the following groups also became eligible for Medicare benefits: persons entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability cash benefits for at least 24 months, most persons with endstage renal disease (ESRD), and certain otherwise noncovered aged persons who elect to pay a premium for Medicare coverage. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) allowed persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease) to waive the 24-month waiting period. Medicare has traditionally consisted of two parts: Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as Part A, and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), also known as Part B. A new, third part of Medicare, sometimes known as Part C, is the Medicare+Choice program, which was established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) and which expanded beneficiaries' options for participation in private-sector health care plans. When Medicare began on July 1, 1966, approximately 19 million people enrolled. In 2002, over 40 million people are enrolled in one or both of Parts A and B of the Medicare program, and 5 million of them have chosen to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan.  Coverage HI is generally provided automatically, and free of premiums, to persons age 65 or older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, whether they have claimed these monthly cash benefits or not. Also, workers and their spouses with a sufficient period of Medi-  38  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare care is necessary. Certain medical supplies and durable medical equipment (DME) may also be provided, though beneficiaries must pay a 20-percent coinsurance for DME, as required under SMI of Medicare. There must be a plan of treatment and periodical review by a physician. Full-time nursing care, food, blood, and drugs are not provided as HHA services.  Hospice care is a service provided to terminally ill persons with life expectancies of 6 months or less who elect to forgo the standard Medicare benefits for treatment of their illness and to receive only hospice care for it. Such care includes pain relief, supportive medical and social services, physical therapy, nursing services, and symptom management. However, if a hospice patient requires treatment for a condition that is not related to the terminal illness, Medicare will pay for all covered services necessary for that condition. The Medicare beneficiary pays no deductible for the hospice program, but does pay small coinsurance amounts for drugs and inpatient respite care. An important HI component is the benefit period, which starts when the beneficiary first enters a hospital and ends when there has been a break of at least 60 consecutive days since inpatient hospital or skilled nursing care was provided. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods covered by HI during a beneficiary's lifetime; however, inpatient hospital care is normally limited to 90 days during a benefit period, and copayment requirements (detailed later) apply for days 6190. If a beneficiary exhausts the 90 days of inpatient hospital care available in a benefit period, he or she can elect to use days of Medicare coverage from a non-renewable ""lifetime reserve"" of up to 60 (total) additional days of inpatient hospital care. Copayments are also required for such additional days. All citizens (and certain legal aliens) age 65 or older, and all disabled persons entitled to coverage under HI, are eligible to enroll in the SMI program on a voluntary basis by payment of a monthly premium. Almost all persons entitled to HI choose to enroll in SMI. In 2001, the SMI program provided protection against the costs of physician and other medical services to almost 38 million people (33 million aged and 5 million disabled). SMI benefits totaled $99.7 billion in 2001. The SMI program covers the following services and supplies:  Physicians' and surgeons' services, including some covered services furnished by chiropractors, podiatrists, dentists, and optometrists. Also covered are the services provided by these Medicare-approved practitioners who are not physicians: certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers (other than in a hospital or skilled nursing facility), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in collaboration with a physician.  Services in an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including same-day surgery, and ambulance services.  Home health care not covered under HI.  Laboratory tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic radiology services, as well as certain preventive care screening tests.  Ambulatory surgical center services in a Medicareapproved facility.  Most physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology services.  Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, and mental health care in a partial hospitalization psychiatric program, if a physician certifies that inpatient treatment would be required without it.  Radiation therapy, renal (kidney) dialysis and transplants, heart, lung, heart-lung, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow transplants, and, as of April 2001, intestinal transplants.  Approved durable medical equipment for home use, such as oxygen equipment and wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and surgical dressings, splints, and casts.  Drugs and biologicals that cannot be self-administered, such as hepatitis B vaccines and immunosuppressive drugs (certain self-administered anticancer drugs are covered). To be covered, all services must be either medically necessary or one of several prescribed preventive benefits. SMI services are generally subject to a deductible and coinsurance (see next section). Certain medical services and related care are subject to special payment rules, including deductibles (for blood), maximum approved amounts (for Medicare-approved physical, speech, or occupational therapy services performed after 2002 in settings other than hospitals), and higher cost-sharing requirements (such as those for outpatient treatments for mental illness). It should be noted that some health care services are not covered by Medicare. Non-covered services include long-term nursing care, custodial care, and certain other health care needs, such as dentures and dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and most prescription drugs. These services are not a part of the Medicare program unless they are a part of a private health plan under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare+Choice (Part C) is an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare. While all Medicare beneficiaries can receive their benefits through the original fee-for-service (FFS) program, most beneficiaries enrolled in both HI and SMI can choose to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan instead. Organiza-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  39   Medicare tions that seek to contract as Medicare+Choice plans must meet specific organizational, financial, and other requirements. Following are the primary Medicare+Choice plans:  Coordinated care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other certified coordinated care plans and entities that meet the standards set forth in the law.  Private, unrestricted FFS plans, which allow beneficiaries to select certain private providers. For those providers who agree to accept the plan's payment terms and conditions, this option does not place the providers at risk, nor does it vary payment rates based on utilization.  Medical savings account (MSA) plans, which provide benefits after a single high deductible is met. Medicare makes an annual deposit to the MSA, and the beneficiary is expected to use the money in the MSA to pay for medical expenses below the annual deductible. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide at least the current Medicare benefit package, excluding hospice services. Plans may offer additional covered services and are required to do so (or return excess payments) if plan costs are lower than the Medicare payments received by the plan. There are some restrictions as to who may elect an MSA plan, even when enrollment is no longer limited to a certain number of participants. employment income without limit. (Prior to 1994, the tax applied only up to a specified maximum amount of earnings.) The HI tax rate is specified in the Social Security Act and cannot be changed without legislation. The HI trust fund also receives income from the following sources: (1) a portion of the income taxes levied on Social Security benefits paid to high-income beneficiaries; (2) premiums from certain persons who are not otherwise eligible and choose to enroll voluntarily; (3) reimbursements from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for the cost of providing HI coverage to certain aged persons who retired when the HI program began and thus were unable to earn sufficient quarters of coverage (and those federal retirees similarly unable to earn sufficient quarters of Medicare-qualified federal employment); (4) interest earnings on its invested assets; and (5) other small miscellaneous income sources. The taxes paid each year are used mainly to pay benefits for current beneficiaries. The SMI program is financed through premium payments ($58.70 per beneficiary per month in 2003) and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Beneficiary premiums are generally set at a level that covers 25 percent of the average expenditures for aged beneficiaries. Therefore, the contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury are the largest source of SMI income. The SMI trust fund also receives income from interest earnings on its invested assets, as well as a small amount of miscellaneous income. Beneficiary premiums and general fund payments are redetermined annually, to match estimated program costs for the following year. Capitation payments to Medicare+Choice plans are financed from the HI and SMI trust funds in proportion to the relative weights of HI and SMI benefits to the total benefits paid by the Medicare program. Beneficiary Payment Liabilities Fee-for-service beneficiaries are responsible for charges not covered by the Medicare program and for various cost-sharing aspects of both HI and SMI. These liabilities may be paid (1) by the Medicare beneficiary; (2) by a third party, such as an employer-sponsored retiree health plan or private ""Medigap"" insurance; or (3) by Medicaid, if the person is eligible. The term ""Medigap"" is used to mean private health insurance that pays, within limits, most of the health care service charges not covered by Parts A or B of Medicare. These policies, which must meet federally imposed standards, are offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BC/BS) and various commercial health insurance companies. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans, the beneficiary's payment share is based on the cost-sharing structure of the specific plan selected by the beneficiary, since each plan has its own requirements. Most plans have lower deductibles and coinsurance than are required of fee-for-service beneficiaries. Such beneficiaries pay the  Program Financing, Beneficiary Liabilities, and Provider Payments All financial operations for Medicare are handled through two trust funds, one for the HI program and one for the SMI program. These trust funds, which are special accounts in the U.S. Treasury, are credited with all receipts and charged with all expenditures for benefits and administrative costs. The trust funds cannot be used for any other purpose. Assets not needed for the payment of costs are invested in special Treasury securities. The following sections describe Medicare's financing provisions, beneficiary cost-sharing requirements, and the basis for determining Medicare reimbursements to health care providers. Program Financing The HI program is financed primarily through a mandatory payroll tax. Almost all employees and self-employed workers in the United States work in employment covered by the HI program and pay taxes to support the cost of benefits for aged and disabled beneficiaries. The HI tax rate is 1.45 percent of earnings, to be paid by each employee and a matching amount by the employer for each employee, and 2.90 percent for self-employed persons. Beginning in 1994, this tax is paid on all covered wages and self-  40  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare monthly Part B premium and may, depending on the plan, pay an additional plan premium. For hospital care covered under HI, a fee-for-service beneficiary's payment share includes a one-time deductible amount at the beginning of each benefit period ($840 in 2003). This deductible covers the beneficiary's part of the first 60 days of each spell of inpatient hospital care. If continued inpatient care is needed beyond the 60 days, additional coinsurance payments ($210 per day in 2003) are required through the 90th day of a benefit period. Each HI beneficiary also has a ""lifetime reserve"" of 60 additional hospital days that may be used when the covered days within a benefit period have been exhausted. Lifetime reserve days may be used only once, and coinsurance payments ($420 per day in 2003) are required. For skilled nursing care covered under HI, Medicare fully covers the first 20 days of SNF care in a benefit period. But for days 21100, a copayment ($105 per day in 2003) is required from the beneficiary. After 100 days of SNF care per benefit period, Medicare pays nothing for SNF care. Home health care has no deductible or coinsurance payment by the beneficiary. In any HI service, the beneficiary is responsible for fees to cover the first 3 pints or units of non-replaced blood per calendar year. The beneficiary has the option of paying the fee or of having the blood replaced. There are no premiums for most people covered by the HI program. Eligibility is generally earned through the work experience of the beneficiary or of his or her spouse. However, most aged people who are otherwise ineligible for premium-free HI coverage can enroll voluntarily by paying a monthly premium, if they also enroll in SMI. For people with fewer than 30 quarters of coverage as defined by SSA, the 2003 HI monthly premium rate is $316; for those with 30 to 39 quarters of coverage, the rate is reduced to $174. Voluntary coverage upon payment of the HI premium, with or without enrolling in SMI, is also available to disabled individuals for whom cash benefits have ceased due to earnings in excess of those allowed for receiving cash benefits. For SMI, the beneficiary's payment share includes the following: one annual deductible (currently $100); the monthly premiums; the coinsurance payments for SMI services (usually 20 percent of the medically allowed charges); a deductible for blood; certain charges above the Medicare-allowed charge (for claims not on assignment); and payment for any services that are not covered by Medicare. For outpatient mental health treatment services, the beneficiary is liable for 50 percent of the approved charges. Provider Payments For HI, before 1983, payments to on a reasonable cost basis. Medicar inpatient hospital services are now bursement mechanism known as the providers were made e payments for most made under a reimprospective payment system (PPS). Under PPS, a specific predetermined amount is paid for each inpatient hospital stay, based on each stay's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification. In some cases the payment the hospital receives is less than the hospital's actual cost for providing the HI-covered inpatient hospital services for the stay; in other cases it is more. The hospital absorbs the loss or makes a profit. Certain payment adjustments exist for extraordinarily costly inpatient hospital stays. Payments for skilled nursing care and home health care are made under separate prospective payment systems. Payments for inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric care are currently reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, but prospective payment systems are expected to be implemented in the near future, as required by the BBA. For SMI, before 1992, physicians were paid on the basis of reasonable charge. This amount was initially defined as the lowest of (1) the physician's actual charge; (2) the physician's customary charge; or (3) the prevailing charge for similar services in that locality. Beginning January 1992, allowed charges were defined as the lesser of (1) the submitted charges, or (2) the amount determined by a fee schedule based on a relative value scale (RVS). Payments for DME and clinical laboratory services are also based on a fee schedule. Most hospital outpatient services are reimbursed on a prospective payment system, and home health care is reimbursed under the same prospective payment system as HI. If a doctor or supplier agrees to accept the Medicareapproved rate as payment in full (""takes assignment""), then payments provided must be considered as payments in full for that service. The provider may not request any added payments (beyond the initial annual deductible and coinsurance) from the beneficiary or insurer. If the provider does not take assignment, the beneficiary will be charged for the excess (which may be paid by Medigap insurance). Limits now exist on the excess that doctors or suppliers can charge. Physicians are ""participating physicians"" if they agree before the beginning of the year to accept assignment for all Medicare services they furnish during the year. Since Medicare beneficiaries may select their doctors, they have the option to choose those who participate. Medicare payments to Medicare+Choice plans are based on a blend of local and national capitated rates, generally determined by the capitation payment methodology described in section 1853 of the Social Security Act. Actual payments to plans vary based on demographic characteristics of the enrolled population. New ""risk adjusters"" based on demographics and health status are currently being phased in to better match Medicare capitation payments to the expected costs of individual beneficiaries.  Claims Processing Medicare's HI and SMI fee-for-service claims are processed by nongovernment organizations or agencies that  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  41   Medicare contract to serve as the fiscal agent between providers and the federal government. These claims processors are known as intermediaries and carriers. They apply the Medicare coverage rules to determine the appropriateness of claims. Medicare intermediaries process HI claims for institutional services, including inpatient hospital claims, SNFs, HHAs, and hospice services. They also process outpatient hospital claims for SMI. Examples of intermediaries are BC/ BS (which utilize their plans in various states) and other commercial insurance companies. Intermediaries' responsibilities include the following:  Determining costs and reimbursement amounts.  Maintaining records.  Establishing controls.  Safeguarding against fraud and abuse or excess use.  Conducting reviews and audits.  Making the payments to providers for services.  Assisting both providers and beneficiaries as needed. Medicare carriers handle SMI claims for services by physicians and medical suppliers. Examples of carriers are the BS plans in a state, and various commercial insurance companies. Carriers' responsibilities include the following:  Determining charges allowed by Medicare.  Maintaining quality-of-performance records.  Assisting in fraud and abuse investigations.  Assisting both suppliers and beneficiaries as needed.  Making payments to physicians and suppliers for services that are covered under SMI. Peer review organizations (PROs) are groups of practicing health care professionals who are paid by the federal government to generally oversee the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries in each state and to improve the quality of services. PROs educate other health care professionals and assist in the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services to the Medicare population. The ongoing effort to combat monetary fraud and abuse in the Medicare program was intensified after enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), which created the Medicare Integrity Program. Prior to this 1996 legislation, CMS was limited by law to contracting with its current carriers and fiscal intermediaries to perform payment safeguard activities. The Medicare Integrity Program provided CMS with stable, increasing funding for payment safeguard activities, as well as new authorities to contract with entities to perform specific payment safeguard functions.  Administration Department of Health and Human Services has the overall responsibility for administration of the Medicare program. Within DHHS, responsibility for administering Medicare rests with CMS. SSA assists, however, by initially determining an individual's Medicare entitlement, by withholding Part B premiums from the Social Security benefit checks of beneficiaries, and by maintaining Medicare data on the master beneficiary record, which is SSA's primary record of beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury collects the HI payroll taxes from workers and their employers. A Board of Trustees, composed of two appointed members of the public and four members who serve by virtue of their positions in the federal government, oversees the financial operations of the HI and SMI trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is the managing trustee. The Board of Trustees reports to Congress on the financial and actuarial status of the Medicare trust funds on or about the first day of April each year. State agencies (usually State Health Departments under agreements with CMS) identify, survey, and inspect provider and supplier facilities and institutions wishing to participate in the Medicare program. In consultation with CMS, these agencies then certify the facilities that are qualified.  Data Summary The Medicare program covers 95 percent of our nation's aged population, as well as many people who are on Social Security because of disability. In 2001, HI covered about 40 million enrollees with benefit payments of $141.2 billion, and SMI covered about 38 million enrollees with benefit payments of $99.7 billion. Administrative costs were about 2 percent of HI and about 2 percent of SMI disbursements for 2001. Total disbursements for Medicare in 2001 were $241 billion. Note: Medicare enrollment data are based on estimates prepared for the 2002 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees to Congress (available on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/publications/trusteesreport/). Medicare benefits, administrative costs, and total disbursements for 2001 are actual amounts for the calendar year, as reported by the Department of the Treasury.

Act * Insured Status Entitlement to Hospital Insurance Benefits 1965 Individual aged 65 or older entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program, or aged 65 before 1968, or 3 quarters of coverage (QC) after 1965 and before attainment of age 65. 3 QC for each year after 1966 and before attainment of age 65. Disabled individual, under age 65, entitled to disability benefits for 24 consecutive months under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program (excludes spouses and children of disabled individuals). Individual under age 65 who has end stage renal disease (ESRD) and who is either fully or currently insured, or is entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program or is the spouse or dependent child of such an insured individual or beneficiary. Entitlement begins on the first day of the third month following the initiation of a course of renal dialysis and ends with the 12th month following the month in which either the dialysis terminates or the individual has a renal transplant. Individual aged 65 or older enrolled in the SMI program who is not otherwise entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of Hospital Insurance premium. 1980 Individual who would be entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program if application were made. Disabled individual under age 65 entitled to disability benefits for at least 24 months, not necessarily consecutive, under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program. Medicare coverage extended for up to 36 months for disabled individuals whose disability continues, but whose monthly benefit ceased because they engaged in substantial gainful activity. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled-worker beneficiary becomes entitled again within 5 years (7 years for disabled widows and widowers and disabled children aged 18 or older). 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 Federal employees covered under HI based on QC for earnings as federal employees and/ or based on deemed QC for earnings as federal employees before 1983.

Individual under age 65 entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Medicare Benefits HI and SMI 1965 1981 Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to benefits provided by liability insurance policies or under no-fault insurance. Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to end stage renal disease (ESRD) for up to 12 months. For workers and their spouses aged 65-69, Medicare is the secondary payer when benefits are provided under an employer-based group health plan (applicable to employers with 20 or more employees who sponsor or contribute to the group plan). Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) will be authorized as providers of benefits. The Secretary of HHS must certify the prospective payment mechanism for HMOs before implementation. 1984 Medicare secondary payer provisions are extended to spouses aged 65-69 of workers under age 65 whose employer-based group health plan covers such spouses. For HMOs, includes medical and other health services furnished by clinical psychologists. 1985 1986 Provides payment for liver transplant services. Extends the working age secondary payer provision to cover workers and their spouses beyond age 69. For HMOs that offered organ transplants as a basic health service on Apr. 15, 1985, such services may be offered from Oct. 1, 1985, through Apr. 1, 1988. For disabled individuals who are covered by employer-based health plans (with at least 100 employees), Medicare is the secondary payer, effective for 1987-1991. 1987 Requires HMOs/competitive medical plans that cease to contract with Medicare to provide or arrange supplemental coverage of benefits related to preexisting conditions for the lesser of 6 months or the duration of an exclusion period. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Clarifies that the secondary payer provision for disabled individuals covered under employerbased health plans for employers with at least 500 employees applies to employers who are government entities. 1990 Requires that Medicare be the secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to ESRD for up to 18 months (extended from 12 months), effective Feb. 1, 1991, to Jan. 1, 1996. The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans (see 1986.); effective through Sept. 30, 1995. 1993 The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans is effective through Sept. 30, 1998.  1972  1982  44  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions The secondary payer provision for beneficiaries with ESRD applies to all beneficiaries with end stage renal disease, not only those entitled to Medicare solely on the basis of it. The extension to include the first 18 months of an individual's entitlement on the basis of ESRD is effective through Sept. 30, 1998. 1997 Established an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare, referred to as Medicare+Choice. All Medicare beneficiaries can receive their Medicare benefits through the original fee-for-service program. In addition, most beneficiaries can choose instead to receive their Medicare benefits through one of the following Medicare+Choice plans: (1) coordinated care plans (such as HMOs, provider-sponsored organizations, and preferred provider organizations); (2) Medical Savings Account (MSA)/ High Deductible plans (through a demonstration available for up to 390,000 beneficiaries); or (3) private fee-for-service plans. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide the current Medicare benefit package (excluding hospice services) and any additional health services required under the adjusted community rate (ACR) process. MSA plans provide Medicare benefits after a single high deductible is met, and enrollees receive an annual deposit in their Medical Savings Account. Transition rules for current Medicare HMO program also provided. The provision making Medicare the secondary payer for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans, previously scheduled to expire Sept. 30, 1998, made permanent. The provision making Medicare secondary payer for the first 12 months of entitlement due to ESRD, which had been extended on a temporary basis (through Sept. 30, 1998) to include the first 18 months of entitlement, has been extended, permanently, to include the first 30 months of entitlement on the basis of ESRD.

Deductible and coinsurance provisions (see Table 2.C1). Lifetime reserve of 60 additional days of inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services transferred to SMI. Services of interns and residents in podiatry training. Unlimited home health visits in a year. Requirement for prior hospitalization eliminated. Home health services provided for up to 4 days a week and up to 21 consecutive days. Alcohol detoxification facility services. 1981 Part A coinsurance is based on the deductible for the calendar year in which services are received rather than the deductible in effect at the time the beneficiary's spell of illness began, starting in 1982. Alcohol detoxification facility services eliminated. 1982 Beneficiaries expected to live 6 months or less may elect to receive hospice care benefits instead of other Medicare benefits. May elect maximum of two 90-day and one 30-day hospice care periods, effective Nov. 1, 1983, to Oct. 1, 1986. For durable medical equipment provided by home health agencies, the payment amount is reduced from 100 percent of costs to 80 percent of reasonable charges.  1967 1972 1980  1984  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  45   Medicare: History of Provisions 1986 Set the Part A deductible for 1987 at $520 with resulting increases in cost sharing. Increased the Part A deductible annually by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital prospective payment rates. Hospice care benefit (enacted in 1982) made permanent. 1987 Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Enrollee pays annual hospital deductible (set at $560 for 1989) and Medicare pays balance of covered charges, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization (except for psychiatric hospital care, which is still limited by 190-day lifetime maximum). The number of days in a skilled nursing facility changed to 150 per year. Deletes the requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days. Expands home health care to provide care for less than 7 days per week and up to 38 consecutive days. Hospice care extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. All 1988 provisions became effective Jan. 1, 1989. 1989 The spell of illness and benefit period coverage of laws determination of inpatient hospital benefits in 1990 and benefit period, Medicare pays 100 percent of covered c hospital care. Coinsurance applies for the next 30 days prior to 1988 return to the later. After the deductible is paid in osts for the first 60 days of inpatient in a benefit period.  1988  The requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days is reinstated for skilled nursing facility services. Coverage returns to 100 days post-hospital care per spell of illness with a daily coinsurance rate in effect for days 21 through 100. Home health services return to a limit of 21 consecutive days of care. Provision providing for home health care for fewer than 7 days per week continued due to a court decision. Hospice care is returned to a lifetime limit of 210 days. 1990 1997 Hospice care is extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled-nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI trust fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period (that is, the HI trust fund will transfer funds to the SMI trust fund during that period). Limits on the number of hours and days that home health care can be provided have been clarified. ""Part time"" now defined as skilled nursing and home health aide services (combined) furnished any number of days per week, for less than 8 hours per day and 28 or fewer hours per week. ""Intermittent"" now defined as skilled nursing care provided for fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours each day (combined) for 21 days or less. Hospice benefit periods are restructured to include two 90-day periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60-day periods. Medicare coverage provided for a number of prevention initiatives, most of which covered under SMI program. HI program affected mainly by two of the initiatives: (1) annual prostate cancer screening for male beneficiaries aged 50 or older, effective Jan. 1, 2000; and (2) colorectal screening procedures, including fecal-occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopies, for beneficiaries age 50 or older, colonoscopy for beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal cancer, and other procedures, including screening barium enemas under certain circumstances.  46  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions 2000 The homebound benefit is clarified to specify that benficiaries who require home health services may attend adult day-care for therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment and still remain eligible for the home health benefit. Homebound beneficiaries may also attend religious services without being disqualified from receiving home health benefits. Effective July 1, 2001, the 24-month waiting period (otherwise required for an individual to establish Medicare eligibility on the basis of a disability) is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The entitlement to Medicare begins with the first month of the Social Security Administration's determination of eligibility for Disability Insurance benefits. There were no changes in 2001 affecting beneficiaries. Supplementary Medical Insurance 1965 Physician and surgeon services. In-hospital services of anesthesiologists, pathologists, radiologists, and psychiatrists. Limited dental services. Home health services, 100 visits in calendar year.

Coverage of outpatient immunosuppresive drugs (see 1986) is broadened/clarifed to include prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). 1988 Beginning Jan. 1, 1990, the beneficiary pays a $75 deductible and 20-percent coinsurance, but once out-of-pocket expenses for the deductible and coinsurance exceed $1,370, Medicare pays 100 percent of allowable charges for remainder of year. Beginning in 1991, Medicare pays 50 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs above $600. When fully implemented in 1993, Medicare will pay 80 percent of prescription drug costs above a deductible that assumes that 16.8 percent of Part B enrollees will exceed the deductible. Certain prescription drugs administered in an outpatient or home setting, including immunosuppressive drugs (previously covered for 1 year after a covered transplant), home intravenous drugs, and certain others, will be covered in 1990 under a new prescription drug provision. 1989 Provisions enacted in 1988 and to begin in 1990 and 1991 are repealed and benefits are restored to levels in effect prior to Jan. 1, 1989. Limits on mental health benefits eliminated in 1990. Coverage extended to services of clinical psychologists and social workers. The annual payment limits of $500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $750, for 1990 and later.

The annual payment limits of $750 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $900 for 1994 and later. (See 1989.) 1997 Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI Trust Fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period, while the cost of the home health services will phase into the SMI premium over 7 years.

For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2001, at least 8 more months will be covered. (The Secretary of HHS will specify the increase, if any, beyond 8 months.) For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2002, 2003, or 2004, the number of additional months may be more or less than 8. (The Secretary will specify the increase for each of these years.) (See 1993.) The annual payment limits of $1,500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, for services furnished by independent practitioners (that is, not by a hospital outpatient department), are suspended for 2000 and 2001.

Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. For calculating the amount of SMI premium surcharge for individuals from age 65 up to age 70 not previously enrolled in SMI, the number of years an individual did not enroll because of coverage by employer group health insurance will not be taken into account. 1985 Extends through calendar year 1988 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs and that increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.  1984  50  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions Premium-paying individuals who do not purchase Part A coverage within a specific time after becoming eligible because of age are subject to a 10-percent penalty for each 12 months they are late in enrolling. There is a cutoff on the length of time these individuals will have to pay an enrollment penalty. The 10-percent premium penalty would be limited to twice the number of years enrollment was delayed. Therefore, if enrollment were delayed 1 year, the penalty would be assessed for 2 years. Individuals in this category and already enrolled will have the length of time the higher premium was paid credited to them. 1987 Extends through calendar year 1989 the provisions requiring that the SMI premium be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs, prohibiting any increase in the premium if there is no Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, and continuing to hold beneficiaries harmless from Social Security check reductions as a result of a premium increase. Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security costof-living adjustments for 1989 and beyond. Extends through calendar year 1990 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs.

They should be used only as overviews and general guides to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the policies or legal positions of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These summaries do not render any legal, accounting, or other professional advice, nor are they intended to explain fully all of the provisions or exclusions of the relevant laws, regulations, and rulings of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Original sources of authority should be researched and utilized. icaid coverage for certain individuals who receive federally assisted income-maintenance payments, as well as for related groups not receiving cash payments. In addition to their Medicaid programs, most states have additional ""state-only"" programs to provide medical assistance for specified poor persons who do not qualify for Medicaid. Federal funds are not provided for state-only programs. The following enumerates the mandatory Medicaid ""categorically needy"" eligibility groups for which federal matching funds are provided:  Individuals are generally eligible for Medicaid if they meet the requirements for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996, or--at state option--more liberal criteria.  Children under age 6 whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).  Pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the FPL (services to these women are limited to those related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care).  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in most states (some states use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements that pre-date SSI).  Recipients of adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV of the Social Security Act.  Special protected groups (typically individuals who lose their cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits, but who may keep Medicaid for a period of time).  All children born after September 30, 1983 who are under age 19, in families with incomes at or below the FPL.  Certain Medicare beneficiaries (described later). States also have the option of providing Medicaid coverage for other ""categorically related"" groups. These optional groups share characteristics of the mandatory groups (that is, they fall within defined categories), but the eligibility criteria are somewhat more liberally defined. The broadest optional groups for which states will receive federal matching funds for coverage under the Medicaid program include the following:  Infants up to age 1 and pregnant women not covered under the mandatory rules whose family income is no more than 185 percent of the FPL (the percentage amount is set by each state).  Children under age 21 who meet the AFDC income and resources requirements that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996.  Overview Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal/state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture jointly funded by the federal and state governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America's poorest people. Within broad national guidelines established by federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each state (1) establishes its own eligibility standards; (2) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; (3) sets the rate of payment for services; and (4) administers its own program. Medicaid policies for eligibility, services, and payment are complex and vary considerably, even among states of similar size or geographic proximity. Thus, a person who is eligible for Medicaid in one state may not be eligible in another state, and the services provided by one state may differ considerably in amount, duration, or scope from services provided in a similar or neighboring state. In addition, state legislatures may change Medicaid eligibility and/or services during the year.  Basis of Eligibility and Maintenance Assistance Status Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Under the broadest provisions of the federal statute, Medicaid does not provide health care services even for very poor persons unless they are in one of the groups designated below. Low income is only one test for Medicaid eligibility for those within these groups; their resources also are tested against threshold levels (as determined by each state within federal guidelines). States generally have broad discretion in determining which groups their Medicaid programs will cover and the financial criteria for Medicaid eligibility. To be eligible for federal funds, however, states are required to provide Med-  52  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid  Institutionalized individuals eligible under a ""special income level"" (the amount is set by each state--up to 300 percent of the SSI federal benefit rate).  Individuals who would be eligible if institutionalized, but who are receiving care under home and community-based services waivers.  Certain aged, blind, or disabled adults who have incomes above those requiring mandatory coverage, but below the FPL.  Recipients of state supplementary income payments.  Certain working-and-disabled persons with family income less than 250 percent of the FPL who would qualify for SSI if they did not work.  TB-infected persons who would be financially eligible for Medicaid at the SSI income level if they were within a Medicaid-covered category (however, coverage is limited to TB-related ambulatory services and TB drugs).  Certain uninsured or low-income women who are screened for breast or cervical cancer through a program administered by the Centers for Disease Control. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-354) provides these women with medical assistance and follow-up diagnostic services through Medicaid.  ""Optional targeted low-income children"" included within the state Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33).  ""Medically needy"" persons (described below). The medically needy (MN) option allows states to extend Medicaid eligibility to additional persons. These persons would be eligible for Medicaid under one of the mandatory or optional groups, except that their income and/or resources are above the eligibility level set by their state. Persons may qualify immediately or may ""spend down"" by incurring medical expenses that reduce their income to or below their state's MN income level. Medicaid eligibility and benefit provisions for the medically needy do not have to be as extensive as for the categorically needy, and may be quite restrictive. Federal matching funds are available for MN programs. However, if a state elects to have a MN program, there are federal requirements that certain groups and certain services must be included; that is, children under age 19 and pregnant women who are medically needy must be covered, and prenatal and delivery care for pregnant women, as well as ambulatory care for children, must be provided. A state may elect to provide MN eligibility to certain additional groups and may elect to provide certain additional services within its MN program. As of August 2002, thirty-six states have elected to have a MN program and are providing at least some MN services to at least some MN beneficiaries. All remaining states utilize the ""special income level"" option to extend Medicaid to the ""near poor"" in medical institutional settings.The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104193)-- known as the ""welfare reform"" bill--made restrictive changes regarding eligibility for SSI coverage that impacted the Medicaid program. For example, legal resident aliens and other qualified aliens who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996 are ineligible for Medicaid for 5 years. Medicaid coverage for most aliens entering before that date and coverage for those eligible after the 5-year ban are state options; emergency services, however, are mandatory for both of these alien coverage groups. For aliens who lose SSI benefits because of the new restrictions regarding SSI coverage, Medicaid can continue only if these persons can be covered for Medicaid under some other eligibility status (again with the exception of emergency services, which are mandatory). Public Law 104-193 also affected a number of disabled children, who lost SSI as a result of the restrictive changes; however, their eligibility for Medicaid was reinstituted by Public Law 105-33, the BBA. In addition, welfare reform repealed the open-ended federal entitlement program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides states with grants to be spent on time-limited cash assistance. TANF generally limits a family's lifetime cash welfare benefits to a maximum of 5 years and permits states to impose a wide range of other requirements as well--in particular, those related to employment. However, the impact on Medicaid eligibility is not expected to be significant. Under welfare reform, persons who would have been eligible for AFDC under the AFDC requirements in effect on July 16, 1996 generally will still be eligible for Medicaid. Although most persons covered by TANF will receive Medicaid, it is not required by law. Title XXI of the Social Security Act, known as the state Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), is a new program initiated by the BBA. In addition to allowing states to craft or expand an existing state insurance program, SCHIP provides more federal funds for states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include a greater number of children who are currently uninsured. With certain exceptions, these are low-income children who would not qualify for Medicaid based on the plan that was in effect on April 15, 1997. Funds from SCHIP also may be used to provide medical assistance to children during a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid. This is one of several options from which states may select to provide health care coverage for more children, as prescribed within the BBA's Title XXI program. Medicaid coverage may begin as early as the third month prior to application--if the person would have been eligible for Medicaid had he or she applied during that time. Medicaid coverage generally stops at the end of the month  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  53   Medicaid in which a person no longer meets the criteria of any Medicaid eligibility group. The BBA allows states to provide 12 months of continuous Medicaid coverage (without reevaluation) for eligible children under the age of 19. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-170) provides or continues Medicaid coverage to certain disabled beneficiaries who work despite their disability. Those with higher incomes may pay a sliding scale premium based on income. The BBA included a state option known as Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE provides an alternative to institutional care for persons aged 55 or older who require a nursing facility level of care. The PACE team offers and manages all health, medical, and social services and mobilizes other services as needed to provide preventative, rehabilitative, curative, and supportive care. This care, provided in day health centers, homes, hospitals, and nursing homes, helps the person maintain independence, dignity, and quality of life. PACE functions within the Medicare program as well. Regardless of source of payment, PACE providers receive payment only through the PACE agreement and must make available all items and services covered under both Titles XVIII and XIX, without amount, duration, or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles, copayments, or other cost sharing. The individuals enrolled in PACE receive benefits solely through the PACE program.  Scope of Medicaid Services Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows considerable flexibility within the states' Medicaid plans. However, some federal requirements are mandatory if federal matching funds are to be received. A state's Medicaid program must offer medical assistance for certain basic services to most categorically needy populations. These services generally include the following: Inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services. Prenatal care. Vaccines for children. Physician services. Nursing facility services for persons aged 21 or older. Family planning services and supplies. Rural health clinic services. Home health care for persons eligible for skilled nursing services.  Laboratory and x-ray services.  Pediatric and family nurse practitioner services.  Nurse-midwife services.  Federally qualified health-center (FQHC) services, and ambulatory services of an FQHC that would be available in other settings.  Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services for children under age 21. States may also receive federal matching funds to provide certain optional services. Following are the most common of the 34 currently approved optional Medicaid services:  Diagnostic services.  Clinic services.  Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR).  Prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices.  Optometrist services and eyeglasses.  Nursing facility services for children under age 21.  Transportation services.  Rehabilitation and physical therapy services.  Home and community-based care to certain persons with chronic impairments.           Amount and Duration of Medicaid Services Within broad federal guidelines and certain limitations, states determine the amount and duration of services offered under their Medicaid programs. States may limit, for example, the number of days of hospital care or the number of physician visits covered. Two restrictions apply: (1) limits must result in a sufficient level of services to reasonably achieve the purpose of the benefits; and (2) limits on benefits may not discriminate among beneficiaries based on medical diagnosis or condition. In general, states are required to provide comparable amounts, duration, and scope of services to all categorically needy and categorically related eligible persons. There are two important exceptions: (1) Medically necessary health care services that are identified under the EPSDT program for eligible children, and that are within the scope of mandatory or optional services under federal law, must be covered even if those services are not included as part of the covered services in that state's Plan; and (2) states may request ""waivers"" to pay for otherwise uncovered home and community-based services (HCBS) for Medicaid-eligible persons who might otherwise be institutionalized. As long as the services are cost effective, states have few limitations on the services that may be covered under these waivers (except that, other than as a part of respite care, states may not provide room and board for the beneficiaries). With certain exceptions, a state's Medicaid program must allow beneficiaries to have some informed choices among participating providers of health care and to receive quality care that is appropriate and timely.  Payment for Medicaid Services Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program. States may pay health care providers directly on a fee-forservice basis, or states may pay for Medicaid services  54  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid through various prepayment arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Within federally imposed upper limits and specific restrictions, each state for the most part has broad discretion in determining the payment methodology and payment rate for services. Generally, payment rates must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered services are available at least to the extent that comparable care and services are available to the general population within that geographic area. Providers participating in Medicaid must accept Medicaid payment rates as payment in full. States must make additional payments to qualified hospitals that provide inpatient services to a disproportionate number of Medicaid beneficiaries and/or to other low-income or uninsured persons under what is known as the ""disproportionate share hospital"" (DSH) adjustment. During 19881991, excessive and inappropriate use of the DSH adjustment resulted in rapidly increasing federal expenditures for Medicaid. Under legislation passed in 1991, 1993, and again within the BBA of 1997, the federal share of payments to DSH hospitals was somewhat limited. However, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) increased DSH allotments for 2001 and 2002 and made other changes to DSH provisions that resulted in increased costs to the Medicaid program. States may impose nominal deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments on some Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services. The following Medicaid beneficiaries, however, must be excluded from cost sharing: pregnant women, children under age 18, and hospital or nursing home patients who are expected to contribute most of their income to institutional care. In addition, all Medicaid beneficiaries must be exempt from copayments for emergency services and family planning services. The federal government pays a share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program. That share, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), is determined annually by a formula that compares the state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent or higher than 83 percent. In 2002, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent in eleven states to 76.09 percent in Mississippi, and averaged 57 percent overall. The BBA also permanently raised the FMAP for the District of Columbia from 50 percent to 70 percent and raised the FMAP for Alaska from 50 percent to 59.8 percent through 2000. The BIPA of 2000 further adjusted Alaska's FMAP to a higher level for 20012005. The federal government pays states a higher share for children covered through the SCHIP program. This ""enhanced"" FMAP averages about 70 percent for all states, compared to the general Medicaid average of 57 percent. The federal government also reimburses states for 100 percent of the cost of services provided through facilities of the Indian Health Service, provides financial help to the twelve states that furnish the highest number of emergency services to undocumented aliens, and shares in each state's expenditures for the administration of the Medicaid program. Most administrative costs are matched at 50 percent, although higher percentages are paid for certain activities and functions, such as development of mechanized claims processing systems. Except for the SCHIP program, the Qualifying Individuals (QI) program (described later), and DSH payments, federal payments to states for medical assistance have no set limit (cap). Rather, the federal government matches (at FMAP rates) state expenditures for the mandatory services, as well as for the optional services that the individual state decides to cover for eligible beneficiaries, and matches (at the appropriate administrative rate) all necessary and proper administrative costs. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (as incorporated into Public Law 106-113, the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000) increased the amount that certain states and the territories can spend on DSH and SCHIP payments, respectively. The BIPA set upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities.  Summary and Trends Medicaid was initially formulated as a medical care extension of federally funded programs providing cash income assistance for the poor, with an emphasis on dependent children and their mothers, the disabled, and the elderly. Over the years, however, Medicaid eligibility has been incrementally expanded beyond its original ties with eligibility for cash programs. Legislation in the late 1980s assured Medicaid coverage to an expanded number of low-income pregnant women, poor children, and to some Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for any cash assistance program. Legislative changes also focused on increased access, better quality of care, specific benefits, enhanced outreach programs, and fewer limits on services. In most years since its inception, Medicaid has had very rapid growth in expenditures. This rapid growth has been due primarily to the following factors:  The increase in size of the Medicaid-covered populations as a result of federal mandates, population growth, and the earlier economic recession. In recent years Medicaid enrollment has declined somewhat.  The expanded coverage and utilization of services.  The DSH payment program, coupled with its inappropriate use to increase federal payments to states.  The increase in the number of very old and disabled persons requiring extensive acute and/or long-term health care and various related services.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  55   Medicaid  The results of technological advances to keep a greater number of very low-birth-weight babies and other critically ill or severely injured persons alive and in need of continued extensive and very costly care.  The increase in drug costs and the availability of new expensive drugs.  The increase in payment rates to providers of health care services, when compared to general inflation. As with all health insurance programs, most Medicaid beneficiaries incur relatively small average expenditures per person each year, and a relatively small proportion incurs very large costs. Moreover, the average cost varies substantially by type of beneficiary. National data for 1999 (excluding Hawaii), for example, indicate that Medicaid payments for services for 20.5 million children, who constitute 51 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries, average about $1,170 per child (a relatively small average expenditure per person). Similarly, for 8.4 million adults, who comprise 20 percent of beneficiaries, payments average about $1,935 per person. However, certain other specific groups have much larger per-person expenditures. Medicaid payments for services for 4.1 million aged, constituting 10 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries, average about $10,335 per person; for 7.3 million disabled, who comprise 18 percent of beneficiaries, payments average about $9,000 per person. When expenditures for these high- and lower-cost beneficiaries are combined, the 1999 payments to health care vendors for 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries average $3,825 per person. Long-term care is an important provision of Medicaid that will be increasingly utilized as our nation's population ages. The Medicaid program paid for over 40 percent of the total cost of care for persons using nursing facility or home health services in 2000. National data for 1999 (excluding Hawaii) show that Medicaid payments for nursing facility services (excluding ICFs/MR) totaled $33.1 billion for more than 1.6 million beneficiaries of these services--an average expenditure of $20,690 per nursing home beneficiary. The national data also show that Medicaid payments for home health services totaled $2.9 billion for more than 800,000 beneficiaries--an average expenditure of $3,625 per home health care beneficiary. With the percentage of our population who are elderly or disabled increasing faster than that of the younger groups, the need for long-term care is expected to increase. Another significant development in Medicaid is the growth in managed care as an alternative service delivery concept different from the traditional fee-for-service system. Under managed care systems, HMOs, prepaid health plans (PHPs), or comparable entities agree to provide a specific set of services to Medicaid enrollees, usually in return for a predetermined periodic payment per enrollee. Managed care programs seek to enhance access to quality care in a cost-effective manner. Waivers may provide the states with greater flexibility in the design and implementation of their Medicaid managed care programs. Waiver authority under sections 1915(b) and 1115 of the Social Security Act is an important part of the Medicaid program. Section 1915(b) waivers allow states to develop innovative health care delivery or reimbursement systems. Section 1115 waivers allow statewide health care reform experimental demonstrations to cover uninsured populations and to test new delivery systems without increasing costs. Finally, the BBA provided states a new option to use managed care. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in some form of managed care program is growing rapidly, from 14 percent of enrollees in 1993 to 57 percent in 2001. More than 40 million persons received health care services through the Medicaid program in fiscal year (FY) 1999 (the last year for which beneficiary data are available). In FY 2001, total outlays for the Medicaid program (federal and state) were $227.8 billion, including direct payment to providers of $162.6 billion, payments for various premiums (for HMOs, Medicare, etc.) of $37.6 billion, payments to disproportionate share hospitals of $15.9 billion, and administrative costs of $11.7 billion. Outlays under the SCHIP program in FY 2001 were $3.8 billion. With no changes to either program, expenditures under Medicaid and SCHIP are projected to reach $394 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, by FY 2007.  The Medicaid-Medicare Relationship Medicare beneficiaries who have low incomes and limited resources may also receive help from the Medicaid program. For such persons who are eligible for full Medicaid coverage, the Medicare health care coverage is supplemented by services that are available under their state's Medicaid program, according to eligibility category. These additional services may include, for example, nursing facility care beyond the 100-day limit covered by Medicare, prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. For persons enrolled in both programs, any services that are covered by Medicare are paid for by the Medicare program before any payments are made by the Medicaid program, since Medicaid is always the ""payer of last resort."" Certain other Medicare beneficiaries may receive help with Medicare premium and cost-sharing payments through their state Medicaid program. Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) and Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMBs) are the best-known categories and the largest in numbers. QMBs are those Medicare beneficiaries who have resources at or below twice the standard allowed under the SSI program, and incomes at or below 100 percent of the FPL. For QMBs, Medicaid pays the Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums and the Medicare coinsurance and deductibles, subject to limits that states may impose on payment rates. SLMBs are Medicare beneficiaries with resources like the QMBs, but with incomes that are higher, though still less than 120 percent of the FPL. For SLMBs,  56  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid the Medicaid program pays only the SMI premiums. A third category of Medicare beneficiaries who may receive help consists of disabled-and-working individuals. According to the Medicare law, disabled-and-working individuals who previously qualified for Medicare because of disability, but who lost entitlement because of their return to work (despite the disability), are allowed to purchase Medicare HI and SMI coverage. If these persons have incomes below 200 percent of the FPL but do not meet any other Medicaid assistance category, they may qualify to have Medicaid pay their HI premiums as Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWIs). For Medicare beneficiaries with incomes that are above 120 percent and less than 175 percent of the FPL, the BBA establishes a capped allocation to states, for each of the 5 years beginning January 1998, for payment of all or some of the Medicare SMI premiums. These beneficiaries are known as Qualifying Individuals (QIs). Unlike QMBs and SLMBs, who may be eligible for other Medicaid benefits in addition to their QMB/SLMB benefits, the QIs cannot be otherwise eligible for medical assistance under a state plan. The payment of this QI benefit is 100 percent federally funded, up to the state's allocation. When all these categories are taken into account, Medicaid is estimated to provide some level of supplemental health coverage for about 6.5 million Medicare beneficiaries. Note: Medicaid data are based on the projections of the Mid-Session Review of the President's Fiscal Year 2003 Budget and are consistent with data received from the states on the Forms HCFA-2082, HCFA-37, and HCFA-64.

Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  57   Unemployment Insurance  Unemployment Insurance Through federal and state cooperation, unemployment insurance programs are designed to provide benefits to regularly employed members of the labor force who become involuntarily unemployed and who are able and willing to accept suitable employment. Workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are covered under unemployment insurance programs. To induce states to enact unemployment insurance laws, the Social Security Act of 1935 provided a tax offset incentive. A uniform national tax was imposed on payrolls of industrial and commercial employers who employed eight or more workers in 20 or more weeks in a calendar year. Employers who paid taxes to a state with an approved unemployment insurance law could credit (offset) up to 90 percent of the state tax against the federal tax. This insured that employers in states without an unemployment insurance law would not have an advantage competing with similar businesses in states with such a law because they would still be subject to the federal payroll tax, and their employees would not be eligible for benefits. In addition, the Social Security Act authorized grants to states to meet the costs of administering the state systems. By July 1937, all 48 states, the then territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia had passed unemployment insurance laws. Later, Puerto Rico adopted its own program, which was incorporated in 1961 into the federal-state system. A similar program for workers in the Virgin Islands was added in 1978. If employers are to receive an offset against federal taxes and if states are to receive federal grants for administration, federal law requires state unemployment insurance programs to meet certain requirements. These requirements are intended to assure that a state participating in the program has an unemployment insurance system that is fairly administered and financially secure. One requirement is that all contributions collected under state laws be deposited in the unemployment trust fund of the U.S. Treasury Department. The fund is invested as a whole, but each state has a separate account to which its deposits and its share of interest on investments are credited. At any time, a state may withdraw money from its account in the trust fund, but only to pay benefits. Thus, unlike the situation in the majority of states having workers' compensation and temporary disability insurance laws, unemployment insurance benefits are paid exclusively through a public fund. Private plans cannot be substituted for the state plan. Aside from federal standards, each state has major responsibility for the content and development of its unemployment insurance law. The state itself decides the amount and duration of benefits (except for certain federal requirements concerning Federal-State Extended Benefits), the contribution rates (with limitations), and, in general, the eligibility requirements and disqualification provisions. The states also directly administer the programs collecting contributions, maintaining wage records (where applicable), taking claims, determining eligibility, and paying benefits to unemployed workers.  Coverage Originally, coverage had been limited to employment covered by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which relates primarily to industrial and commercial workers in private industry. However, several federal laws added substantially to the number and types of workers protected under the state programs, such as the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 and the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976. Private employers in industry and commerce are subject to the law if they have one or more individuals employed on 1 day in each of 20 weeks during the current or preceding year, or if they paid wages of $1,500 or more during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding year. Agricultural workers are covered on farms with a quarterly payroll of at least $20,000 or employing 10 or more employees in 20 weeks of the year. Domestic employees in private households are subject to FUTA if their employer pays wages of $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter. Excluded from coverage are workers employed by their families and the self-employed. Before 1976, employment in state and local governments and nonprofit organizations were exempt from FUTA. However, as a result of federal legislation enacted in 1976, most employment in these groups must now be covered by state law as a condition for securing federal approval of the state law. Under this form of coverage, local government and nonprofit employers have the option of making contributions as under FUTA or of reimbursing the state for benefit expenditures actually made. Elected officials, legislators, members of the judiciary, and the state National Guard are still excluded, as are employees of nonprofit organizations that employ fewer than four workers in 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Many states have extended coverage beyond that provided by federal legislation. Through special federal legislation, federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers of the armed forces were brought under the unemployment insurance system. Benefits for those persons are financed through federal funds but are administered by the states and paid in accordance with the provisions of the state laws. A separate unemployment insurance law enacted by Congress covers railroad workers.  58  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Unemployment Insurance Amendments to FUTA made in 2000 added Indian tribes to the set of entities for whom coverage is required, although they are not liable for FUTA taxes. As a result, workers performing services for tribes are now potentially eligible to receive Unemployment Insurance benefits. Coverage is required when service is performed for any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group community which is recognized as eligible for federal assistance because of their status as Indians. The same permissible exclusion from coverage that are applicable to other governmental entities also apply to services performed for Indian tribes. If an Indian tribe fails to make payments to states as required, the tribe loses its FUTA exemption and may lose coverage. all benefit levels. The other laws use a weighted schedule that gives a greater proportion of the high-quarter wages to lower paid workers than to those earning more. Each state establishes a ceiling on the weekly benefit amount and no worker may receive an amount larger than the ceiling. The maximum may be either a fixed dollar amount or a flexible amount. Under the latter arrangement, which has been adopted in 35 jurisdictions, the maximum is adjusted automatically in accordance with the weekly wages of covered employees. Twelve states provide additional allowances for certain dependents. They all include children under ages 16, 18, or 19 (and, generally, older if incapacitated); 8 states include a nonworking spouse; and 2 states consider other dependent relatives. The amount allowed per dependent varies considerably by state but generally is $24 or less per week and, in the majority of states, the amount is the same for each dependent. All but 12 states require a waiting period of 1 week of total unemployment before benefits can begin. Four states pay benefits retroactively for the waiting period if unemployment lasts a certain period or if the employee returns to work within a specified period. Except for two jurisdictions, states provide a statutory maximum duration of 26 weeks of benefits in a benefit year. However, jurisdictions vary the duration of benefits through various formulas.  Eligibility for Benefits Unemployment benefits are available as a matter of right (without a means test) to unemployed workers who have demonstrated their attachment to the labor force by a specified amount of recent work or earnings in covered employment. All workers whose employers contribute to or make payments in lieu of contributions to state unemployment funds, federal civilian employees, and ex-servicemembers are eligible if they are involuntarily unemployed, able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. Workers must also meet the eligibility and qualifying requirements of the state law and be free from disqualifications. Workers who meet these eligibility conditions may still be denied benefits if they are found to be responsible for their own unemployment. Work Requirements A worker's monetary benefit rights are based on his or her employment in covered work over a prior reference period called the ""base period,"" and these benefit rights remain fixed for a ""benefit year."" In most states, the base period is the first 4 quarters of the last 5 completed calendar quarters preceding the claim for unemployment benefits. Benefits Under all state laws, the weekly benefit amount--that is, the amount payable for a week of total unemployment-- varies with the worker's past wages within certain minimum and maximum limits. In most states, the formula is designed to compensate for a fraction of the usual weekly wage, normally about 50 percent, subject to specified dollar maximums. Three-fourths of the laws use a formula that computes weekly benefits as a fraction of wages in one or more quarters of the base period. Most commonly, the fraction is taken of wages in the quarter during which wages were highest because this quarter most nearly reflects full-time work. In most of these states, the same fraction is used at  Extended Benefits In the 1970s, a permanent federal-state program of Extended Benefits (EB) was established for workers who exhaust their entitlement to regular state benefits during periods of high unemployment. The program is financed equally from federal and state funds. Employment conditions in an individual state trigger Extended Benefits. This happens when the unemployment rate among insured workers in a state averages 5 percent or more over a 13week period, and is at least 20 percent higher than the rate for the same period in the 2 preceding years. If the insured unemployment rate reaches 6 percent, a state may by state law disregard the 20-percent requirement in initiating Extended Benefits. Once triggered, Extended Benefit provisions remain in effect for at least 13 weeks. When a state's benefit period ends, Extended Benefits to individual workers also end, even if they have received less than their potential entitlement and are still unemployed. Further, once a state's benefit period ends, another statewide period cannot begin for at least 13 weeks. State law determines most eligibility conditions for Extended Benefits and the weekly benefit payable. However, under federal law a claimant must have had 20 weeks in full-time employment (or the equivalent in insured wages) and must meet special work requirements. A worker who has exhausted his or her regular benefits is eligible for a 50-percent increase in duration of benefits for a  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  59   Unemployment Insurance maximum of 13 weeks of Extended Benefits. There is, however, an overall maximum of 39 weeks of regular and Extended Benefits. Extended Benefits are payable at the same rate as the weekly amount under the regular state program. Prior to the 1992 legislation, the EB program was based on the insured unemployment rate (IUR)-the number of unemployed workers receiving benefits in a state as a percentage of the number of persons in unemployment-- insurance covered employment in that state. By definition, the IUR does not include workers who have exhausted their benefits but are still unemployed. The 1992 legislation (P.L. 102-318) provided states the option of adopting an additional formula for triggering the permanent Extended Benefits program. Effective March 1993, states had the option of amending their laws to use alternative total unemployment rate triggers in addition to the current insured unemployment rate triggers. Under this option, Extended Benefits would be paid when (1) the state's seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate for the most recent 3 months is at least 6.5 percent, and (2) that rate is at least 110 percent of the state average total unemployment rate in the corresponding 3-month period in either of the 2 preceding years. States triggering on to the Extended Benefits program under other triggers would provide the regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in addition to 13 weeks of Extended Benefits, (which is the same number of weeks of benefits provided previously). In addition, states that have chosen the total unemployment rate option will also amend their state laws to add an additional 7 weeks of Extended Benefits (for a total of 20 weeks) where the total unemployment rate is at least 8 percent and is 110 percent of the state's total unemployment rate for the same 3 months in either of the 2 preceding years. As of April 13, 2002, extended Benefits were payable for 13 weeks in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. CONTACT: Rita L. DiSimone (202) 358-6221.  60  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Workers' Compensation  Workers' Compensation Workers' compensation was the first form of social insurance to develop widely in the United States. It is designed to provide cash benefits and medical care when employees suffer work-related injuries or illnesses, and survivor's benefits to the dependents of workers whose deaths result from a work-related incident. In exchange for receiving benefits, workers who receive workers' compensation are generally not allowed to bring a tort suit against their employers for damages of any kind. The federal government was the first to establish a workers' compensation program, covering its civilian employees with an act that was passed in 1908 to provide benefits for workers engaged in hazardous work. The remaining federal workforce was covered in 1916. Nine states enacted workers' compensation laws in 1911. By 1920, all but seven states and the District of Columbia had workers' compensation laws. Today each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands has its own program. The federal government covers its employees through its own program. It also administers the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, enacted in 1927, which covers longshore and harbor workers throughout the United States. Coal miners suffering from pneumoconiosis, or black lung disease, are covered by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, with the initial benefits enacted as part of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Under this program, monthly cash benefits are payable to miners disabled by black lung disease and to their dependents or survivors. Medical benefits are also payable on the basis of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 instituted a new program that covers employees, contractors, and sub-contractors of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for exposure to beryllium and the contraction of chronic beryllium disease. In addition, employees of private companies providing beryllium to DOE are covered. Employees' survivors also receive cash benefits. This same act also covers employees disabled or killed by cancers that developed after beginning employment at a DOE or an atomic weapons facility, as long as the cancer was at least ""as likely as not"" related to this employment, subject to a number of guidelines relating to radiation exposure, type of cancer, and other relevant factors. It also provides benefits for silica-related diseases and to uranium miners and their survivors who have received lump-sum payments under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and establishes an Office of Worker Advocacy in the Department of Energy to deal with other claims of workrelated occupational disease.  Coverage In 2000, state and federal workers' compensation laws covered about 123.7 million employees. Covered payroll in 2000--that is, total wages paid to covered workers--was $4.3 trillion. Common exemptions from coverage are domestic service, agricultural employment, small employers, and casual labor. However, 39 programs have some coverage for agricultural workers, and 25 programs have some coverage for domestic workers. Many programs exempt employees of nonprofit, charitable, or religious institutions. The coverage of state and local public employees differs widely from one state program to another. Two other major groups outside the coverage of workers' compensation laws are railroad employees engaged in interstate commerce and seamen in the U.S. Merchant Marine. Those workers have health insurance and shortterm and long-term cash benefit plans that cover disabilities whether or not the conditions are work-related. In addition, under federal laws they retain the right to bring tort suits against their employers for negligence in the case of work-related injuries or illness. The programs are compulsory for most private employment, except in Texas, where it is elective. If Texas employers reject it, they lose the customary common-law defenses against suits by employees in private industry.  Benefits The benefits provided under workers' compensation include periodic cash payments and medical services to the worker during the period of disablement for the disabling condition. They also include death and funeral benefits to the workers' survivors. Lump-sum settlements are permitted under most programs. Approximately three-fourths of all workers' compensation cases involve only medical benefits. Cash wage replacement benefits are categorized according to the duration and severity of the worker 's disability. Temporary and Permanent Total Disability A large majority of compensation cases involving cash payments involve temporary total disability. That is, employees are unable to work at all while they are recovering from the injury but they are expected to recover. When workers' lost time exceeds the waiting period (3 to 7 days, depending on the state) they receive a percentage of their weekly wages--typically two-thirds--up to a maximum weekly amount. The maximum generally being set at some percentage of the states average weekly wage, ranging from 66-2/3 percent to 200 percent, but typically 100 percent.

Its primary protect the rights and quality of life for the senior citizens of Maryland. Established in 1975 of Aging, the department receives its statutory authority under Article 70B, Annotated Code and the federal Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended. With the enactment of Chapter 1998 the department attained cabinet level status. mission is to as the Office of Maryland 573, Acts of  MDoA is charged with responsibilit ies delegated to the State under the Older Americans Act, not otherwise designated by law to some other unit o f St at e government. This includes planning, coordinating, administering, and assessing public pro grams and services carried out at State and local levels in the areas of income maintenance, nutrit io n, lo ng-term care, public guardianship, housing, advo cacy, employment, education, recreation, and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally handicapped.  Proposed Deficiency A $504,000 fiscal 2001 deficiency appropriation is requested to cover expenses of Medicaid waiver clients not covered by the Medicaid Waiver Program. The fiscal 2001 appropriation provides local case management services for the Medicaid waiver, but there are gaps in coverage of costs for Medicaid waiver clients otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage. (See Issue 2 concerning Medicaid waiver case management problems.)  Governor's Proposed Budget Exhibit 1 indicates the MDoA allowance increases by $3,826,550 or 10.4 %. MDoA has a very small staff and, therefore, provides very few direct services to the elderly. Two additional contractual positions are provided in the 2002 allowance. Most services to the aging population are provided by local aging agencies (LAAs). The State provides grants for case management and direct services provided by local aging agencies. The MDoA allowance for LAAs increases $3,451,271, of which $2,780,696 of the increase is in general funds and $670,575 is in federal funds. The allowance includes case management funds to be distributed to LAAs to implement the Medicaid waiver. The Medicaid program in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) will pay most costs for 13 services covered by the waiver including: assisted living; home health; personal care; and respite care.  3   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Exhibit 1  Governor's Proposed Budget  Department of Aging ($ in Thousands) How Much It Grows: 2001 Working Appropriation 2002 Governor's Allowance Amount Change Percent Change Where It Goes: Personnel Expenses Fiscal 2002 general salary increase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The legislation supports a staffing ratio at the higher of: (1) one full-time ombudsman per 1,000 long-term beds; (2) 20 hours of ombudsman time per week per LAA; or (3) 10 ho urs of ombudsman time per week per nursing home. The fiscal no t e indicat ed that there are currently 261 nursing homes in 24 jurisdictions and projected expenditures of $1,917,800 in fiscal 2001 and $2,692,100 in fiscal 2002, based on 10 hours per nursing ho me. The fiscal 2002 allowance provides $1,905,486 to handle 5,518 complaints. The program is augmented with volunteer ombudsmen.  Senior Center Activities Operating Fund Legislation The new $500,000 grant for the Senior Center Activities operating fund implements House Bill 759 (Chapter 635, Acts of 2000). At least 50% of the funds for senior citizen activities are to be distributed to counties in eco no mically distressed areas. The fund may not be used to supplant existing funds of senior centers. Senior centers continue to receive most of their funds from the local government.  Assisted Living Group Home Subsidy The increase ($561,931) in assisted living subsidy will provide for an additional 80 clients in group homes. Exhibit 3 indicates that 465 individuals will receive group home subsidies -- an average of $6,888 per client. This group of clients is not eligible for the Medicaid waiver coverage.  Performance Analysis: Managing for Results The number one goal of MDoA is to increase opportunities for the elderly to live in independent living arrangements and for those with disabilities requiring assistance to receive long-term care services. Exhibit 3 indicates the number of clients served in the direct service programs. Exhibit 4 indicates that MDoA's success in providing services to clients is measured by reducing the number of eligible persons on the waiting list and increasing the number of providers. This includes expansion of alternative models for local senior nutrition programs to two additional jurisdictio ns in fiscal 2002. There are already nutrition programs in all 24 jurisdictions. The second goal is to insure that residents of long-term care are treated with dignity. This is achieved by increasing contacts with the long- term care industry and expanding training of long-term care providers. Success will be measured by a reduction in the complaints handled by the Ombudsman Program, which receives additional funds for case management in fiscal 2001 and 2002.  7   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Exhibit 4  Program Measurement Data  Department of Aging Fiscal Years Ann.

Expansion of the Home- and Community-Based Services Waiver During the 1999 session, the General Assembly sought to expand the number of options for low-income seniors who want to prevent or delay their admission into nursing homes. This resulted in the enactment of Senate Bill 593 in 1999 (Chapter 593, Acts of 1999), which directed DHMH to apply for a Medicaid waiver that would cover home- and community-based services.  Problems with the Old Waiver Maryland has had a Medicaid waiver since 1993. Under that waiver, eligible low-income adults could receive long-term care in a community-based setting rather than in a nursing facility. The waiver provided services to 135 eligible seniors. The 1993 waiver required the senior to meet the Medicaid financial requirements, be at least 62 years of age, be eligible for MDoA housing subsidies, and be medically qualified for skilled nursing care. As a result of the restrictive requirements, most qualified seniors were in nursing homes and too ill for assisted living or home care.  The New Waiver The Health Care Financing Administrat io n (HCFA) approved DHMH's new waiver application. Applicants would be qualified if they needed a nursing home placement immediately. HFCA rejected Maryland's attempt to establish an ""at risk"" standard in the waiver application submitted in 1999. Medical eligibility for the waiver has not changed. The client must still qualify for a Medicaid nursing home level of care. Under the new MDoA regulations, low-income adults may be eligible to receive home care or live in a licensed assisted living facility and are: at least 50 years old; have a monthly income of no more than $1,590 (300% of SSI level); have assets that are no more than $2,000 to $2,500 depending on the eligibility category; and qualify for nursing facility level of care. Under the waiver, Medicaid would pay the following reimbursement rates: assisted living for level II ($1,530 monthly) and level III ($1,930 monthly) care; assistive devices, e. g. , a wheel chair (Medicaid pays actual approved costs not to exceed $100 per item); behavior consultation services ($35 per hour); 9  ! ! ! ! ! ! !   DA.07 - Department of Aging  environmental accessibility, e.g., wheel chair ramps (Medicaid pays actual approved costs with a lifetime limit of $3,000); environmental assessments ($350); family or consumer training ($55 per hour); home delivered meals ($5 per delivered meal); home health at Medicaid's current reimbursement methodology; respite care ($64 to $138 per day or $9 to $11.50 per hour); personal care ($9 to $15 per hour for aide services); and Senior Center Plus ($40).  The vast majority of seniors needing assisted living services need assisted living level I services and would not be eligible for the Medicaid waiver. These would be seniors who can perform four of the five basic life skills but are unable to live at home alone or in senior independent living housing. Typically, this group needs no more than two to four hours a week of direct patient care in a group home or assisted living licensed facility. This group would be eligible for assisted living under most private long-term care insurance contracts. This care typically costs $70 to $100 a day or $2,100 to $3,000 a month in the private market. These individuals are not eligible for the Medicaid waiver because HCFA requires waiver clients to qualify for the nursing home level of care. In fiscal 2002, 465 income-eligible clients not eligible for the Medicaid Waiver Program will receive a group home subsidy that averages $6,688 per year, while 1,084 eligible clients needing long-term care but not eligible for the Medicaid waiver will remain on the waiting list. These subsidies are provided by the Senior Housing Program, which is supported by general funds. MDoA should brief the committees on the status of eligible clients who need assisted living level I or group home services who are not covered by any program after the implementation of the Medicaid waiver because of limitation of funds for direct services. Since the medical eligibility for the waiver has not changed and the client must still qualify for the nursing home level of care, MDoA needs to explain how more clients will qualify under the new Medicaid waiver.  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  Medicaid Coverage Still Limited  2. Medicaid Waiver Case Management Problems MDoA has requested a $504,000 fiscal 2000 deficiency appropriation to cover Medicaid management services to assisted living clients and clients who continue to live in their homes. agencies provide t he case management services. The case manager assists in the client interviews the client, arranges a medical assessment by the local health department agency, 10  waiver case Local aging application, and secures   DA.07 - Department of Aging  the applicant's financial eligibility for the program from the Department of Human Resources. The case manager authorizes services and assists in placing the client by locating the appropriate provider. The case manager must maintain client records, assure quality of care, and assess continuing client eligibility every 12 months. MDoA indicates that the operating deficiency was created because the federal reimbursement from DHMH for the original smaller waiver program (assisted living services only) was much lower than MDoA budgeted in fiscal 2000. MDoA assumed the federal reimbursement from Medicaid would be 50% of Medicaid costs; instead MDoA reports they were reimbursed for 10% of costs because ""DHMH deducts medical expenses paid by Medicaid for the client from the federal reimbursement due MDoA."" The medical expenses include doctors' visits (out-patient), surgery (in-patient), prescription costs, etc. In some months MDoA reports that the medical expenses were so large that MDo A ended up paying DHMH rather than receiving reimbursement. The net effect of this was a shortfall at the end of fiscal 2000 which rolled over into fiscal 2001 and resulted in the projected deficiency for fiscal 2001. It is not clear if the problem will occur in fiscal 2002 with the new waiver. This problem raises several questions. Why are medical expenses deducted fro m t he Medicaid provider reimbursement for assisted living under the Medicaid waiver? Medical expenses for doctors are a separate Medicaid-covered expense with doctors reimbursed for services provided to income-eligible clients under Medicaid in-patient and out-patient medical service reimbursement rate schedules. Some of the problem may have been that not all waiver clients met t he eligibility requirements in regular Medicaid coverage. Therefore, MDoA had to absorb some of their medical costs. Medicaid reports that the problem occurred under the more limited Medicaid waiver involving 135 clients and is less likely to occur under the more generous waiver. Under the more limited waiver -- best described as nursing home triage -- to be eligible for assisted living or home care Medicaid coverage, a senior had to be medically and income eligible for nursing care. Most were too ill for assisted living and home care. Still the begging question -- why was MDoA and/or LAAs paying medical bills for patients who may have been Medicaid eligible for medical bill coverage? Eligibility for Medicaid coverage for medical coverage is less rigorous than that for assisted living and home care under either the old or new Medicaid waiver. The questions arising from this deficiency request are almost endless. DLS recommends that MDoA and the DHMH Medical Care Programs Administration brief the budget committees on the reimbursement mechanism for long-term care under the Medicaid waiver and explain how medical bills are submitted and paid for long-term care and home care for seniors under the Medicaid waiver. MDoA and DHMH should explain how and why the problem occurred in the first place and what mechanisms are in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the problem.  3. Medicaid Waiver Contractual Positions The allowance includes two new contractual positions, one Administrator III ($52,051) and a Human Services Specialist ($35,328) for administration of the Medicaid Waiver Program. The new positions are in fact existing positions that MDoA added for the Medicaid Waiver Program. The positions provide a variety of services for the Medicaid Waiver Program including technical assistance to LAAs, training new 11   DA.07 - Department of Aging  and existing providers on the Medicaid Waiver Program, and assisting providers with the electronic billing for Medicaid payments. MDoA indicates that the positions were created in August 2000 as the quickest way to create the needed positions for the Medicaid Waiver Program and reflected this in their fiscal 2002 budget submission. MDoA plans to convert the contractual positions to regular positions or PINs that already exist. MDoA has indicated that when the PINs are filled, the contractual positions will no longer be needed. The budgeted t urno ver for the agency is 2.43% so the PINs are already funded. It is recommended that the contractual positions be deleted as they will no longer be needed in fiscal 2002.  12   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Recommended Actions Amount Reduction 1.

Trends  In December 2000, 45,414,800 persons received Social Security benefits, an increase of 819,200 (1.8 percent) since December 1999, compared with an increase of 0.8 percent in the preceding year. This significant increase is related to the elimination of the earnings test in 2000 for persons who have reached the full retirement age. The number of retired workers increased by more than 700,000 in 2000 (2.6 percent), compared with an increase of 1.0 percent in 1999. The 28,499,000 retired workers represented 63 percent of all beneficiaries in December 2000. Another 10 percent were nondisabled widows and widowers (4,700,000). Seventy-one percent of the 28.5 million retiredworker beneficiaries received reduced benefits because of retirement prior to age 65. Relatively more women (75 percent) than men (68 percent) received reduced benefits. The number of persons aged 65 or older receiving Social Security benefits rose from 31.4 million in 1995 to 32.7 million in 2000 (4.0 percent). Beneficiaries aged 85 or older increased at a greater rate during the 5-year period (12.8 percent) from 3,576,000 in 1995 to 4,034,000 in 2000. In 2000, 39,500 centenarians were receiving Social Security. More than 19 million women aged 65 or older were receiving benefits in December 2000. Seven million (36.4 percent) were entitled solely to a retired-worker benefit, and another 5.5 million (28.9 percent) were dually entitled to a retired-worker benefit and a wife's or widow's benefit. About 6.6 million (34.7 percent) were receiving wife's or widow's benefits only. Almost 3 million children under age 18 were receiving benefits, including 1,346,100 children of deceased workers, 1,374,400 children of disabled workers, and 255,900 children of retired workers. In December 2000, 5,972,400 beneficiaries were receiving payments on the basis of disability-- 5,042,300 disabled workers, 728,700 disabled adult children, and 201,400 disabled widows and widowers. In addition, 165,100 spouses and 1,409,200 minor and student children of disabled workers were receiving benefits.   The leading causes of disability for disabled workers were mental disorders other than mental retardation (27 percent), and musculoskeletal conditions (23 percent). About 11 percent had circulatory conditions and an additional 10 percent had diseases of the nervous system and sense organs. Average monthly benefits for December 2000, including the 3.5 percent COLA increase, were $845 for retired workers, $786 for disabled workers, and $810 for nondisabled widows and widowers. Among retired workers, benefits averaged $951 for men and $730 for women. For disabled workers, average benefits were $883 for men and $661 for women. Average monthly family benefits for December 2000 were $1,502 for a widowed mother or father and children; $1,323 for a disabled worker, wife, and children; and $1,640 for a retired worker, wife, and children. Total OASDI benefit payments for calendar year 2000 were $407.6 billion. Payments from the OASI trust fund were $352.7 billion--an increase of 5.5 percent from the $334.4 billion paid in 1999. Benefit payments from the DI trust fund, from which benefits are paid to disabled workers, their spouses, and children, increased by 7.0 percent from $51.4 billion in 1999 to $55.0 billion in 2000. OASDI benefit awards in calendar year 2000 totaled 4,290,100, including 1,960,600 to retired workers, 456,900 to their spouses and children and 843,300 to survivors of insured workers. Benefits were awarded to 621,600 disabled workers and 407,600 of their spouses and children. Awards to disabled workers were 620,500 in 1999 and 608,100 in 1998.                      2  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Supplemental Security Income Federal benefit rate change, effective January 2001 Cost-of-living adjustment Monthly amount for-- Individual living in his or her own household Couple with both members eligible Program Data Total: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federally administered payments: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federal SSI payments: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federally administered state supplementation: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 State-administered supplementation: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 $31.6 billion 6.7 million $385.52 $30.7 billion 6.6 million $378.82 $27.3 billion 6.3 million $351.48 $3.4 billion 2.5 million $112.16 1  3.5 percent $531 796  $0.9 billion 2 .7 million $110.95  1 Includes 2.2 million persons receiving federal SSI and state supplementation and 0.3 million persons receiving state supplementation only. 2 Includes 83,500 persons receiving state supplementation only.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  3   Supplemental Security Income Program Trends  In December 2000, 6,601,700 persons received federally administered SSI payments--45,100 more than the previous year. Of the total, 2,010,900 (30 percent) were aged 65 or older; 3,744,000 (57 percent) were blind or disabled aged 18-64; and 846,800 (13 percent) were blind or disabled under age 18. The number of blind or disabled aged 18-64 rose by 53,000 (1.4 percent) between December 1999 and December 2000, while the number under age 18 remained virtually unchanged. In comparison, between December 1998 and December 1999, blind or disabled aged 18-64 increased by 1.2 percent, while blind or disabled under age 18 dropped by 4.5 percent. During 2000, 747,200 persons were awarded federally administered payments, a decrease of 1.4 percent from the previous year. Of the 2000 awards, 483,200 went to blind or disabled recipients aged 18-64, 144,600 to those blind or disabled under age 18, and 119,400 to recipients aged 65 or older.  Total SSI payments were $31.6 billion in 2000, up 2.0 percent from 1999. The 1999 increase over 1998 was 2.5 percent. Federal SSI payments in 2000 were $27.3 billion (an increase of 1.8 percent over the previous year). Federally administered state supplementation totaled $3.4 billion and state-administered supplementation $892.7 million, increasing by 2.4 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively from the previous year's totals. In 2000, the leading causes of disability among the blind or disabled between the ages of 18 and 64, and those under age 18 were mental disorders and mental retardation. Among disabled recipients between the ages of 18 and 64, 25.7 percent had mental retardation as the primary diagnosis, and 34.4 percent were diagnosed with another mental disorder. These conditions were also the most frequent diagnoses for blind or disabled under age 18.        4  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Health Care Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A): Total benefits paid in calendar year 2000 Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B): Total benefits paid in calendar year 2000 Number of enrollees in July 2000, (one or both of Parts A and B) Aged Disabled Administrative costs, 2000: Hospital Insurance As a percent of total benefits paid Supplementary Medical Insurance As a percent of total benefits paid Medicaid Medical service expenditures in fiscal year 1998 Number of unduplicated recipients, fiscal year 1998 Average 1998 vendor payment per unduplicated recipient: Persons aged 65 or older Permanently and totally disabled persons Dependent children under age 21 Average 1998 vendor payment for medical services: Nursing facility services Inpatient general hospital care Prescribed drugs Physician's services $142.3 billion 40.7 million $10,242 9,095 1,203 $19,379 5,031 699 327 $128.5 billion $88.9 billion 39.6 million 34.3 million 5.3 million $2.6 billion 2.1 percent $1.8 billion 2.0 percent  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  5   Unemployment Insurance 2000 Total payments Average-- Weekly benefit amount (regular programs) Duration of benefits Weekly insured unemployment Covered employment $20.3 billion $221 13.7 weeks 2.1 million 127.9 million  Workers' Compensation 1999 Benefit payments: Total Compensation payments Medical and hospitalization Benefits paid by-- Private insurance carriers State and federal funds Employers' self-insurance Covered workers per month Costs as a percent of covered payroll  $43.4 billion 25.3 billion 18.0 billion 23.8 billion 10.2 billion 9.3 billion 123.9 million 1.29 percent  Temporary Disability Insurance Programs in effect in-- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the railroad industry.

Eligibility and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's contributions to Social Security. Benefits are paid as an earned right to workers, their families and their survivors. There is no means test to qualify for benefits. During 2000, more than 45 million people received cash benefits at a rate exceeding $34 billion each month ($408 billion annually). According to the latest Social Security Trustees Report, these cash benefits comprised just over 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. During the same year, approximately 153 million employees and self-employed workers, along with employers, contributed more than $492 billion to the OASDI trust funds-- through which contributions are credited and benefits are paid. Social Security benefits are essential to the economic well-being of millions of individuals. Social Security pays benefits to more than 90 percent of those 65 or older. It is the major source of income (providing 50 percent or more of total income) for 64 percent of the beneficiaries. It contributes 90 percent or more of income for almost one-third of the beneficiaries, and is the only source of income for 20 percent of them (see charts 14 at the end of this section). By law, the OASI and DI trust funds may only be disbursed for: (1) Monthly benefits for workers and their families. (2) Vocational rehabilitation services for disabled beneficiaries. (3) Administrative costs (currently less than 1 percent of expenditures). (4) The lump-sum death payment to eligible survivors. 0  Revenue received from FICA payments is transferred to the U.S. Treasury. FICA revenue in excess of outlays is used to purchase special interest-bearing Treasury bonds. These securities remain assets of the trust funds until needed to cover Social Security costs.  Provisions for Railroad Retirement Board Beneficiaries The OASDI tables do not include a number of persons receiving Railroad Retirement benefits who would be eligible for Social Security benefits had they applied. The reason they have not applied is that receipt of a Social Security benefit would reduce their Railroad Retirement benefit by a like amount. The number of persons is not available, but is estimated to be less than 100,000. The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, effective January 1, 1975, provided that the regular annuity for employees with 10 or more years of railroad service who retired after December 31, 1974, will consist of two components:  Tier 1--A basic Social Security level component equivalent to what would be paid under the Social Security Act on the basis of the employee's combined railroad and nonrailroad service, reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit under OASDI actually paid on the basis of nonrailroad work; and  Tier 2--A ""private pension"" component payable over and above the Social Security equivalent, calculated on the basis of the number of years of railroad service.  Contributions and Trust Funds A person contributes to Social Security either through payroll taxes or self-employment taxes under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) or the Self-Employed Contribution Act (SECA). Employers match the employee contribution, while self-employed workers pay an amount equal to the combined employer-employee contributions. (Self-employed workers receive a special tax deduction to ease the impact of paying the higher rate). There is a maximum yearly amount of earnings subject to OASDI taxes, $80,400 in 2001. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). Employees whose contributions exceed the maximum taxable amount because they worked for more than one employer can receive refunds of excess FICA payments when they file their tax returns. Taxes are allocated to the Old-Age (Retirement) and Survivors Insurance (OASI), the Disability Insurance (DI), and the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. In addition to the taxes on covered earnings, OASI and DI trust fund revenues include interest on trust fund securities, income from taxation of OASI and DI benefits, certain technical transfers, and gifts or bequests.  Structure and Organization The OASDI program is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) which became an independent agency in 1995. The Commissioner of Social Security serves a 6-year term following appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate. A bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board serves to review existing laws and policies and commissions studies and issues recommendations intended to anticipate changing circumstances. The President appoints three of the seven board members and Congress appoints the other four members.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  9   Social Security The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. Major headquarter components include the National Computer Center that contains SSA's mainframe computers that drive our systems, much of the executive staff for policy, programs and systems as well as field support components. SSA's field structure is divided into 10 geographic regions containing over 1,300 field installations in communities throughout the country. Office sizes range from large urban offices with 50 or more employees to remote resident stations staffed by one or two individuals. Each region is headed by a Regional Commissioner, and staffed with specialists to handle regional administrative tasks and to assist field offices with operational issues. In addition, there are teleservice centers servicing all regions. While physically located within the various regions, each teleservice center manages the public's Social Security business from throughout the nation using state of the art communications systems. Seven program service centers provide service and support for the field offices in some aspects of Social Security's workloads. Tables 2.F1  2.F11 provide administrative data: Table 2.F2 summarizes data describing SSA's national workforce, and table 2.F3 provides a historical record of work years committed to SSA's overall operations. Table 2.F4 provides workload data for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance programs, and table 2.F5 similarly provides workload data for the Disability Insurance program. Table 2.F7 provides data on the operation of SSA's teleservice centers. ber 1999 2.4 percent cost-of-living increase would have been 2.5 percent in the absence of the 1999 CPI error. SSA also determined that the December 2000 3.5 percent costof-living increase was not affected by the CPI error. SSA issued one-time payments in July 2001 to compensate beneficiaries for any shortfall in their benefits experienced between January 2000 and July 2001. Beginning in August 2001, ongoing benefits were adjusted based on the recalculated CPI. Elimination of Annual Earnings Test for Persons Reaching Full Retirement Age Public Law 106-182, The Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary attains full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. Elimination of this earnings test is effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1999. The earnings limit that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the limits previously established for persons at FRA through age 69--$17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $3 of earnings above these exempt amounts. In determining earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. The legislation also permits retired workers to earn delayed retirement credits for any months between the attainment of full retirement age and age 70 for which the worker requests that benefits not be paid. Public Law 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continues to be pegged to increases in the average wage. This amount increased from $10,080 in 2000 to $10,680 in 2001. Withholding for beneficiaries subject to this earnings test is at $1 for each $2 of earnings over the exempt amounts. Work Incentives Improvement Act The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, Public Law 106-170, was enacted on December 17, 1999. This legislation provides major enhancements to SSA's programs that assist disabled beneficiaries who attempt to return to work. It provides beneficiaries more choices in vocational rehabilitation services, and offers expanded health care for beneficiaries who are no longer eligible for cash benefits due to work. Effective October 1, 2000, the Act offers extended Medicare coverage to beneficiaries who return to work, and offers buy-in for Medicaid coverage. The Ticket to Work provisions of this legislation will be phased in over a 3-year period beginning January 1, 2001. The provisions include demonstration projects that will eventually apply a disability earnings test more directed toward individuals' earnings history and circumstances of  Significant Program Changes Program changes occur through legislation or (in areas where authority is delegated to the Commissioner) through regulation. Recent program changes follow: Change in the Consumer Price Index Cost-of-Living Adjustment The consumer price index (CPI), prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the Department of Labor, provides the basis for an annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits. On September 28, 2000, the BLS announced their discovery of a software error used in the CPI calculation, affecting the calculation for months after 1998. Section 308 of Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21, 2000, requires the Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies that administer benefit programs to determine whether the CPI computation error for 1999 resulted in a shortfall in payments to beneficiaries and to compensate beneficiaries for any such shortfall. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determined that the Decem-  10  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security their reemployment. The Ticket to Work will emphasize and encourage rehabilitation efforts and will reimburse private vocational rehabilitation agencies for their services to beneficiaries attempting to return to work. Also beginning January 1, 2001, former beneficiaries may have their benefits resumed if their work activity ends within 5 years of the month their benefits stopped and they are still disabled. Regulatory Increases in Substantial Gainful Activity and in Trial Work Period Amounts Effective July 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration raised from $500 to $700 the amount of monthly earnings for a nonblind disabled individual to be considered engaging in substantial gainful activity (SGA). Effective January 1, 2001, the top SGA level was raised to $740 per month, with the provision that ongoing SGA levels will be automatically adjusted annually based on increases in the national average wage index. The SGA threshold is part of the definition of disability that requires an individual to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity to be eligible for benefits. Earnings of more than the top SGA level will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is engaged in SGA. Earnings of less than $300 per month will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is not engaged in SGA. Earnings between $300 and the top SGA level will require that consideration be given to circumstances related to the work activity. A different definition of SGA applies to blind persons receiving Social Security disability benefits. Increases in the SGA amount for blind individuals are pegged to increases in the national average wage index and thus were not affected by the 1999 or subsequent rule changes. The level for blind individuals increased from $1,170 in 2000 to $1,240 in 2001. New rules also affect the trial work period (TWP). The TWP allows disability beneficiaries to test their ability to work for at least 9 months. During the TWP, beneficiaries may earn any amount and still receive full benefits. The monthly level at which earnings count toward the 9-month TWP was raised from $200 to $530 effective January 1, 2001, with future increases pegged to the national average wage index. After completion of nine trial work months, the SGA level is used to determine whether earnings are substantial or not. If earnings fall below the SGA level, full benefits generally continue. If earnings are higher than the SGA level, cash benefits are usually suspended while medical benefits continue. Table 2.A30 provides related historical data on disability program earnings guidelines, including reference to recent changes in thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA).  Coverage and Financing In 2000, about 153 million persons worked in employment or self-employment covered under the OASDI program. In recent years, coverage has become nearly universal for work performed in the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately 96 percent of the American workforce are covered by OASDI. Workers excluded from coverage fall into five major categories: (1) Civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, (2) Railroad workers (who are covered under the railroad retirement system, which is coordinated with Social Security), (3) Certain employees of state and local governments who are covered under their employers' retirement systems, (4) Domestic workers and farm workers ings do not meet certain minimum (workers in industry and commerce regardless of the amount of earnings) whose earnrequirements are covered , and  (5) Persons with very low net earnings from selfemployment, generally under $400 annually. 0  Table 2.A1 outlines the history of coverage provisions and table 2.A2 provides a history of provisions regarding noncontributory wage credits, mostly for military service. 0  For most employees, taxes are withheld from wages beginning with the first dollar earned. The exceptions are domestic employees, election workers, and agricultural workers. In 2001, a domestic employee must earn $1,300 from any single employer in a calendar year before FICA is withheld. Most election workers must earn $1,100 in 2001 before FICA is withheld. Most agricultural workers wages are covered if the employer pays more than $2,500 in total wages in a year or if the individual worker earns over $150 in a year from a single employer. Employees, their employers, and the self-employed each pay taxes on earnings in covered employment and self-employment up to an annual maximum taxable amount for OASDI. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). The OASDI maximum taxable amount--$80,400 in 2001--is updated automatically each year in relation to increases in the national average annual wage. The current FICA tax rate applicable to both employees and employers is 6.2 percent for OASDI (5.30 percent for OASI and 0.9 percent for DI), and 1.45 percent for HI.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  11   Social Security ment, workers who reach age 62 in 1991 or later need the maximum number of 40 QCs to be fully insured. For workers who become disabled or die before age 62, the number of QCs needed for fully insured status depends on their age at the time the worker is disabled or dies. A minimum of 6 QCs is required regardless of age. Currently Insured If a worker dies before achieving fully insured status, benefits can still be paid to qualified survivors if the worker was ""currently insured"" at the time of death. (In the case of a young worker, survivor benefits are potentially payable to a worker's children and to a widow(er) with children in care.) To be currently insured, the worker must have earned 6 QCs in the 12 quarters before death (that is, 6 of the last 13 quarters, including the quarter in which death occurred). Disability Insured To qualify for disability benefits, a nonblind worker must have recent work activity as well as being fully insured. Under the test involving recent work experience, a nonblind worker older than age 31 must have earned at least 20 QCs among the 40 calendar quarters ending with the quarter in which the disability began. Workers disabled at ages 24 through 30 must have earned QCs in one-half of the calendar quarters elapsing between age 21 and the calendar quarter in which the disability began. Workers under age 24 need 6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with the quarter of disability onset. Workers who qualify for benefits based on blindness need only be fully insured. Table 2.A7 summarizes the basic provisions concerning insured status.  See Table 2.A3 for annual amounts of maximum taxable earnings and contribution rates. Table 2.A4 shows historical annual maximum amounts of contributions by employees and self-employed persons. A self-employed person pays the combined employeeemployer rate of 12.4 percent for OASDI and 2.9 for HI under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA). Two deduction provisions reduce the SECA and income tax liability of self-employed persons. The intent of these provisions is to treat the self-employed in much the same manner as employees and employers are treated for purposes of FICA and income taxes. The first provision allows a deduction from net earnings from self-employment equal to the amount of net earnings before the deduction, times one-half the SECA tax rate. The effect of this deduction is intended to be analogous to the treatment of the FICA tax paid by the employer, which is disregarded as remuneration to the employee for FICA and income tax purposes. The second provision allows an income tax deduction, equal to one-half of the amount of the SECA tax paid, which is designed to reflect the income tax deductibility of the employer's share of the FICA tax. Table 2.A5 describes income tax credits for 198489 intended to cushion the impact of increases in FICA and SECA taxes enacted in 1983. The SECA tax credits were replaced, effective 1990, by the deduction provisions described above. Table 2.A6 outlines the history of provisions regarding appropriations from general revenues and interfund borrowing.  Insured Status To become eligible for his or her benefit and benefits for family members or survivors, a worker must earn a minimum number of credits based on work in covered employment or self-employment. These credits are described as quarters of coverage. In 2001, a quarter of coverage (QC) is credited for each $830 in annual covered earnings, up to a maximum of four QCs for the year. Earnings of $3,320 or more in 2001 will give the worker four QCs regardless of when the money is actually earned or paid during the year. The amount of earnings required for a QC is adjusted automatically each year in proportion to increases in the average wage level. Fully Insured Eligibility for most types of benefits requires that the worker be fully insured. To be fully insured a worker must have a number of QCs at least equal to the number of calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950 if later) and the year in which he or she reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies--whichever occurs first. Under this require-  International Agreements The President is authorized to enter into international Social Security agreements (also called ""totalization"" agreements) to coordinate the U.S. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program with comparable programs of other countries. The United States currently has Social Security agreements in effect with 18 countries. Agreements with several other countries are in progress.

First, they eliminate dual Social Security coverage, the situation that occurs when a person from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Each agreement includes rules that assign a worker's coverage to only one country. The second goal of the agreement is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers and their family members may qualify for a partial U.S. benefit based on ""totalized"" (that is, combined) credits from both countries. Similarly, workers may qualify for partial benefits from the foreign country based on totalized credits. Table 5.M1 provides data on the number of beneficiaries receiving totalization payments, and average benefits. Table 2.A8 shows the indexing factors applicable to the earnings of workers who were first eligible in 1988 2001. Table 2.A9 shows indexed earnings for workers first eligible in 19942001 who had maximum taxable earnings in each year after 1950. For a more detailed technical description of an AIME computation, including a computation worksheet, see the Technical Note ""Computing a Retired-Worker Benefit."" (2) Determining AIME: The period used to calculate AIME equals the number of full calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950, if later) and the year of first eligibility, usually excluding the lowest 5 years. Workers disabled before age 47 have between zero and four excluded years from the computation. At an absolute minimum, two years are used to compute AIME. The actual years used in the computation--the ""computation years""--are the years of highest indexed earnings after 1950, including any years before age 22 or after age 61 as well as the year of disability or death. AIME is calculated as the sum of indexed earnings in the computation period, divided by the number of months in that period. Table 2.A10 provides a historical outline of provisions related to AIME and AMW, and describes variations in the number of dropout years. Tables 2.A15 and 2.A16 describe AMW benefit computations based on the worker's nonindexed earnings after 1936 and 1950, respectively. (Very few persons currently being awarded benefits have PlAs computed under these old-start or new-start computation methods. These methods, particularly the new-start method shown in table 2.A16, are more frequently applicable in earnings re-computations for workers who reached age 62 before 1979.) (3) Computing the PIA: The formula used to compute the PIA from AIME is weighted to provide a higher PIA-to-AIME ratio for workers with comparatively low earnings. The formula applies declining percentage conversion rates to three AIME brackets. For workers who reach age 62, become disabled, or die in 2001, the formula provides a PIA equal to the sum of: 90 percent of the first $561 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $2,820 of AIME, plus 15 percent of AIME over $3,381. 0  Benefit Computation and Automatic Adjustment Provisions The primary insurance amount (PIA) is the monthly benefit amount payable to the worker upon retirement at full retirement age or upon entitlement to disability benefits. The PIA is also the base figure from which monthly benefit amounts payable to the worker's family members or survivors are determined. The PIA is derived from the worker's annual taxable earnings, averaged over a period that encompasses most of the worker's adult years. Until the late 1970s, the average monthly wage (AMW) was the earnings measure generally used. For worker's first eligible for benefits after 1978, average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) have replaced the AMW as the usually applicable earnings measure. The PIA computation based on AIME currently involves the following three steps: (1) Indexing of earnings: The worker's annual taxable earnings after 1950 are updated, or indexed, to reflect the general earnings level in the indexing year--the second calendar year before the year in which the worker is first eligible; that is, first reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies. Earnings in years after the indexing year are not indexed but instead are counted at their actual value. A worker's earnings for a given year are indexed by multiplying them by the following ratio (indexing factor): The average wage in the national economy for the indexing year, divided by the corresponding average wage figure for the year to be indexed.  Beginning with the first year of eligibility, the PIA is increased by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Table 2.A11 shows the PIA formula and first applicable COLA for workers first eligible in 1979 or later.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  13   Social Security The dollar amounts defining the AIME brackets are referred to as ""bend points."" These bend points (as described in table 2.A11) are updated automatically each year in proportion to increases in the national average wage level. This automatic adjustment ensures that benefit levels for successive generations of eligible workers will keep up with rising earnings levels, thereby assuring consistent rates of earnings replacement from one generation of beneficiaries to the next. The benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of eligibility (or death) rather than on the year benefits are first received. Thus the PIA of a worker retiring at age 65 in 2001 is calculated using the benefit formula that applies to all workers first eligible in 1998 (the ""year of attainment"" of age 62). The PIA derived from that formula is then increased by the COLAs effective for December, 1998, 1999, and 2000 to obtain the PIA effective at age 65. Subsequent recomputations of the worker's benefit, including additional earnings not originally considered, delayed retirement credits or additional COLA increases, all refer to the basic computation that originally applied, based on the year of attainment. Beginning in 1981, benefits have been rounded to the next lower ten cents at each step in the computation. The final benefit payment is rounded to the next lower dollar amount (if not already an even dollar). Prior to 1981, benefits were paid in ten-cent increments after rounding up to the next dime in each computation step. A cost-of-living increase in benefits generally is established each year if the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), prepared by the Department of Labor, indicates a percentage increase (after rounding) of at least 0.1 percent between two specified quarters. The arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for July, August, and September in the year of determination is compared with the arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for the later of (a) July, August, and September in the year in which the last effective cost-of-living increase was established or (b) the 3 months of the calendar quarter in which the effective month of the last general benefit increase occurred. The percentage increase in the CPI-W, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent, represents the size of the increase in benefits, effective for December of the year in which the determination is made. Under certain conditions, depending on the size of the combined OASDI trust funds relative to estimated disbursements, the applicability and size of a cost-of-living adjustment may be determined under an alternative method, called the ""stabilizer provision."" In no case, however, are benefits reduced below the level of benefits in the year of determination. Historically, this provision has never been triggered.  Table 2.A18 presents a history of provisions relating to the automatic adjustment of benefits, including a description of the stabilizer provision. In addition, table 2.A18 includes a summary history and description of provisions relating to the annual automatic adjustment of (1) the maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, (2) the dollar amount needed to establish a quarter of coverage, (3) the bend points defining the AIME brackets in the PIA formula and the PIA brackets in the maximum family benefit formula, and (4) the exempt amounts under the earnings (retirement) test. All of these adjustments are linked to increases in the level of the national average annual wage, rather than to increases in the CPI. Table 2.A19 illustrates the cumulative effect of statutory and automatic increases in benefits for workers who have been in benefit status over varying time periods. Alternative PIA Computation Provisions  Special minimum PIA.--Workers with low earnings but steady attachment to the workforce over most of their adult years may qualify for monthly benefits based on the special minimum PIA computation. This computation does not depend on the worker's average earnings, but on the number of coverage years--years in which the worker had earnings equal to or above a specified amount. The level of the special minimum PIA is the same for workers having the same number of coverage years, regardless of age or year of first eligibility. Increases in the special minimum PIA are linked to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). See table 2.A12 for additional information on the special minimum PIA.  Windfall Elimination Provision PIA.--WEP affects persons who receive a pension based on noncovered work after 1956 and Social Security benefits. First eligibility for the noncovered pension and Social Security benefits must be after December 31, 1985 for WEP to apply. WEP reduces the Social Security PIA upon which SSA benefits are based and affects all benefits paid on that record, except survivors. The WEP reduction ceases when entitlement to the pension payment ends, the wage earner dies, or the wage earner earns a total of 30 years of substantial Social Security earnings. The WEP reduction amount is never more than one-half of the noncovered pension. A WEP PIA is generally based on 40 percent of the first bend point instead of 90 percent as with the regular PIA:  14  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security Example: A retired worker with a noncovered pension of $2,000 a month and less than 20 years of covered employment attains age 62 in 2001. Normal PIA, based on AIME of $800: $561 x .90 = $504.90 $239 x .32 = $76.48 PIA = $581.30 WEP PIA, based on AIME of $800: $561 x .40 = $224.40 $239 x .32 = $76.48 PIA = $300.80 If a worker has more than 20 years of substantial covered earnings, the WEP PIA begins to increase. With the 21st year of substantial covered earnings, the first bend point percentage is increased by 5 percentage points. This rate of increase applies for each additional year of substantial covered earnings, through the 30th year of substantial earnings at which point WEP no longer applies. After 23 years of substantial coverage, for example, the first bend point percentage would be 55 percent. Thirty years of substantial earnings would yield a first bend point percentage of 90 percent (the normal percentage of the first bend point). Examples of pensions subject to WEP are U.S. Civil Service Retirement System annuities, retirement benefits based on foreign earnings, and state and local pensions based on noncovered earnings. Table 2.A11.1 provides more detail about the WEP computation and contains the amounts of substantial earnings for years after 1990. Substantial earnings for earlier years are listed in table 2.A12.  For information on family maximum provisions, as described here, see table 2.A13 (comparison of family maximums to the PIAs on which they are based), and table 2.A14 (disability family maximums). Table 2.A17 shows the maximum family benefit amounts applicable in cases of first eligibility before 1979.  Benefit Types and Levels Retired and Disabled Workers The full retirement age (FRA) is the earliest age at which an unreduced retirement benefit is payable (sometimes referred to as the ""normal retirement age""). The age for full retirement benefits is scheduled to rise gradually from age 65 to age 67, with the first incremental increase affecting workers who reach age 62 in the year 2000. Workers over age 62 who retire before FRA can receive reduced benefits. The monthly rate of reduction from the full retirement benefit (that is, the PIA) is 5/9 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA. The reduction rate is 5/12 of 1 percent a month for any additional months. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age. If a disabled worker receives a reduced retirement benefit for months before disability entitlement, the disability benefit is reduced by the number of months for which he or she received the reduced benefit. For workers who postpone their retirement beyond the full retirement age, benefits are increased for each month of nonpayment beyond that age. This increase is called a ""delayed retirement credit,"" and is potentially available for any or all months following attainment of the full retirement age (currently a maximum of 60 months for persons age 65). The annual rate of increase for delayed retirement credits is 6-1/2 percent for workers who reach age 62 in 1999 or 2000, 7 percent in 2001 and 2002, and will eventually rise to 8 percent for workers reaching age 62 in 2005 or later. Spouses and Children of Workers Spouses receive 50 percent of the worker's PIA (regardless of the worker's actual benefit amount), if the spouse has attained the full retirement age at entitlement to spousal benefits. The spouse of a retired or disabled worker can elect monthly benefits as early as age 62. These benefits are reduced at the rate of 25/36 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA and 5/12 of 1 percent for each additional month. Children of retired or disabled workers are also eligible to receive monthly benefits. The term ""child"" refers to a child under the age of 18, a child aged 1819 attending elementary or secondary school full time, or to an adult child,  Family maximum provisions.--Monthly benefits payable to the worker and family members or to the worker's survivors are subject to a maximum family benefit amount. The family maximum level for retired-worker families or survivor families usually ranges from 150 percent to 188 percent of the worker's PIA. The maximum benefit for disabled-worker families is the smaller of 85 percent of AIME (or 100 percent of PIA, if larger) or 150 percent of the PIA. Like the formula for determining the PIA, the maximum family benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of first eligibility (that is, the year of attainment of age 62, onset of disability, or death). Once the worker's maximum family benefit amount for the year of first eligibility is determined, it is updated in line with the COLAs.

In addition, young spouses (that is, those under the age of 62) who care for a worker's entitled child may also be eligible. For purposes of defining young spouses' benefits, the term ""child"" refers to a child under age 16, or to an adult child of the worker who was disabled prior to age 22. Children of retired or disabled workers can receive up to 50 percent of the worker's PIA, as can young spouses. (The benefit of a young spouse is not reduced for age.) Monthly benefits payable to the spouse and children of a retired or disabled worker are limited to a family maximum amount, as discussed earlier. Benefits are payable to unmarried divorced spouses of retirement age who were married at least 10 years to the worker. A divorced spouse benefit is excluded from family maximum provisions. Divorced spouses age 62 or older and divorced for 2 or more years (after marriage of 10 or more years) may be independently entitled on the record of the ex-spouse if the ex-spouse could be entitled if he or she applied. Survivors Benefits Widows and widowers of fully insured workers are eligible for unreduced benefits at full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. As with retired workers and spouses, widows' and widowers' FRA will gradually increase to age 67. Widows and widowers can elect reduced monthly benefits at age 60 or, if disabled, as early as age 50. Surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits if married to the worker for at least 10 years and not remarried before age 60 (age 50 if disabled). For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is 65, the monthly rate of reduction for the first 60 months immediately preceding FRA is 19/40 of 1 percent of the worker's PIA, with a maximum reduction of 28.5 percent at age 60. For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is over 65, the amount of reduction for each month prior to FRA is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the maximum reduction at age 60 remains 28.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Benefits for widows and widowers are increased if the deceased worker delayed retirement beyond the FRA. In these cases, the survivor benefits include any delayed retirement credits the deceased worker had earned. Conversely, if the worker had elected early retirement, widows' and widowers' benefits are limited for widows and widowers first entitled to survivor benefits at age 62 or later. For these beneficiaries, the benefit is the higher of 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA or the amount the worker would be receiving if still alive. Disabled widows and widowers ages 5060 receive the age 60 widow's rate (71.5 percent of PIA) regardless of their age at the time of entitlement. Children of deceased workers and mothers and fathers under FRA are eligible to receive monthly benefits up to 75 percent of the worker's PIA if the worker died either fully or currently insured. Mothers and fathers must be caring for the worker's entitled child who is either under age 16 or disabled. A dependent parent aged 62 or older is eligible for monthly benefits equal to 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Each of two dependent parents can qualify for benefits equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA. Monthly benefits payable to survivors are reduced to conform to the family maximum benefit payable on the deceased worker's account. Benefits for a surviving divorced spouse, however, are disregarded when computing the maximum family benefit. See table 2.A20 for more information on the increases in the full (or ""normal"") retirement age for workers. Table 2.A21 describes age-related reductions for dependent beneficiaries, as does table 2.A22 (widows and widowers). Additionally, tables 2.A23 and 2.A24 show the history of legislation relating to special monthly benefits payable to certain persons born before January 2, 1900. Table 2.A25 summarizes the history of certain OASDI benefits other than monthly benefit payments. Table 2.A26 presents illustrative monthly benefit amounts for selected beneficiary families, based on hypothetical earnings histories representing five different earnings levels. Table 2.A27 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 62 in various years beginning with 1957 (the first full year benefits became available at age 62). Table 2.A28 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 65 in various years beginning with 1940.  Effect of Current Earnings on Benefits Beneficiaries under age 65 with earnings in excess of certain exempt amounts may have all or part of their benefits withheld as a result of the annual earnings test (AET) provisions of the Social Security Act. For those aged 65 or older, however, there have been recent changes to AET provisions. Amendments in 1996 eased the impact of AET provisions, while changes in 2000 removed the AET altogether for beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Public Law 104121, enacted March 29, 1996 substantially raised the exempt amounts under the annual earnings test for persons who have reached full retirement age. These amounts are $12,500 in 1996; $13,500 in 1997; $14,500 in 1998; $15,500 in 1999; $17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. After 2002, the annual exempt amount will be indexed to the growth in average wages. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 in benefits for every $3 of earnings above the age 65 exempt amount. Public Law 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches full retirement age (FRA). The annual earnings test that applies in the year one attains FRA is based on the  16  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security more generous annual limits established under P.L. 104121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test, only earnings before the month of attainment of age 65 will be counted. Public Laws 104-121 and 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under age 65 throughout the year. This annual amount continues to be pegged to increases in average wages. The amounts are $10,080 in 2000, and $10,680 in 2001. When the annual earnings limit affects working beneficiaries under age 65, benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. Individuals have the option to receive reduced benefits under a monthly earnings test if it is to their advantage to do so. This option is usually exercised in the first year of retirement, as in that year the monthly test permits payment for some months even if the annual earnings limit is greatly exceeded. Under the monthly test, beneficiaries receive a full monthly benefit for months in which they do not earn over an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual earnings limit. The monthly earnings test is applied to the self-employed based on hours they work instead of monthly earnings. Generally, beneficiaries are eligible for the monthly earnings test in only one year. Table 2.A29 provides historical detail on the retirement test. Beneficiaries entitled on the basis of their own disability--disabled workers, disabled adult children, and disabled widows and widowers--are not subject to the earnings test. Substantial earnings by disabled beneficiaries, however, may indicate that they are able to do work which constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are therefore no longer disabled. Although other factors are considered, numerical earnings thresholds are used in a determination of SGA. Table 2.A30 provides historical thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA). For married beneficiaries filing jointly with adjusted gross income under $32,000 a year, no Social Security benefits are subject to taxation. If adjusted gross income exceeds $32,000 but is under $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of one-half of income over $32,000. If a couple's adjusted gross income exceeds $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is 85 percent of income over $44,000 plus the lesser of $6,000 or one-half of benefits. However, no more than 85 percent of benefits are subject to income tax. The income thresholds for single beneficiaries are $25,000 and $32,000. If members of a married couple are filing separately, they do not have a minimum threshold if they lived together any time during the tax year. The amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits, or 85 percent of all income as defined above. Like all matters dealing with tax liability, taxation of Social Security benefits fall under the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service. Table 2.A31 shows the history of provisions related to taxation of Social Security benefits. Table 2.A32 offers examples to illustrate when benefits are taxable, and the amount subject to taxation.  Taxation of Benefits Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on the beneficiary's income, marital status, and filing status. The definition of income for this provision is as follows: Adjusted gross income (before Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are considered), plus tax-exempt interest income, with further modification of adjusted gross income in some cases involving certain tax provisions of limited applicability among the beneficiary population; plus onehalf of Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits.

Disabled workers  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  21   Supplemental Security Income  Supplemental Security Income The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income support to persons aged 65 or older, blind or disabled adults, and blind or disabled children. Eligibility requirements and federal payment standards are nationally uniform. The 2001 federal SSI benefit rate for an individual living in his or her own household and with no countable income is $531 monthly; for a couple (with both husband and wife eligible), the SSI benefit rate is $796 monthly. Payments under SSI began in January 1974. It replaced the former federal-state adult assistance programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became eligible for SSI in January 1998. Under the SSI program, each eligible person is provided a monthly cash payment based on a statutory federal benefit rate. Since 1975, these rates have been increased by the same percentage as the cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefits. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and is receiving both food and shelter from the person in whose household they are living, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third. This is done instead of determining the actual dollar value of the in-kind support and maintenance. For institutionalized persons, the eligibility requirements and payment standards depend on the type of institution. With some exceptions, inmates of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. For persons institutionalized for a complete calendar month, a maximum federal SSI payment of $30 per month applies where (1) the institution receives a substantial part of the cost of the person's care from the Medicaid program, or (2) recipients' under age 18 have private health insurance making payments to the institution. Other eligible persons in institutions may receive up to the full federal benefit rate. The federal payment is based on the individual's countable income. The first $20 monthly in OASDI benefits or other earned or unearned income is not counted. Also excluded is $65 monthly of earnings plus one-half of any earnings above $65. For example, a person living in his or her own household, whose sole income is a $200 monthly OASDI benefit, would receive $351 in federal SSI payments: $531 - ($200 - $20) = ($531 -$180) = $351. 0  A person whose income consists of $500 in gross monthly earnings would receive $323.50 in federal SSI payments: $531 - (($500 - $85) / 2 = $207.50 countable earnings. Federal benefit rate $531 - $207.50 = $323.50 federal SSI. 0  Individuals generally are not eligible for SSI if they have resources in excess of $2,000 (or $3,000 for a couple). Certain resources are excluded, most commonly a home, an automobile used for essential transportation, and household goods and personal insurance of reasonable value, burial plots and spaces, and life insurance. States have the option to supplement the federal SSI payment for all or selected categories of persons, regardless of previous state program eligibility. Initially, states were required to supplement to assure that recipients did not suffer a loss in total income from the former state programs. Most of these ""converted"" cases have now left the rolls.  22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Supplemental Security Income  Chart 1.

Aged: Any person aged 65 or older. Blind: Any person with 20/200 lenses, or with tunnel vision of to the Blind (AB) program is eli continues to meet the October or less vision in the better eye with the use of correcting 20 degrees or less. An individual transferred from a state Aid gible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and 1972 state definition of blindness.  Disabled: Any person unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. For a child under age 18, eligibility is based on disability of severity comparable with that of an adult. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) program to SSI is also eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of disability. 1973 Public Law 93-233, enacted December 31 Only persons who had received APTD before July 1973 and were on the rolls in December 1973 may receive SSI on the basis of the state definition of disability; those who became eligible for state aid from July to December 1973 must meet the federal definition of disability. A disabled recipient who loses federal SSI eligibility because of earnings at the substantial gainful activity level may continue to receive a special benefit under section 1619 and retain eligibility for Medicaid under title XIX of the Social Security Act. This special benefit status may continue as long as the recipient has the disabling impairment and meets all nondisability SSI eligibility criteria. States have the option of supplementing this special benefit. This provision of the law was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Beginning in January 1984, under a 1-year demonstration project, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for either regular SSI payments or special monthly benefits. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 legislation were extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 amendments are made permanent. The provisions were amended effective July 1, 1987, with significant modifications to simplify administration and to allow free movement between regular SSI disability payments and either the special cash benefit or Medicaid eligibility under section 1619. The distinction between a disabled person eligible for regular SSI payments and one eligible for 1619(a) is that the latter has several months with gross earnings above the SGA level. Previously, section 1619(a) status required completion of a trial work period and the determination that the work was SGA. For individuals under age 18, the ""comparable severity"" standard is eliminated and replaced with a requirement that a child be considered disabled if he/she has a medically determin-  1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  25   SSI: History of Provisions  able impairment that results in ""marked and severe functional limitations,"" and meets the existing statutory duration requirement. The law also eliminates references to ""maladaptive behaviors"" in the Listing of Impairments for children, and discontinues the use of individualized functional assessments for children. SSI eligibility is prohibited for an individual in any month during which such an individual is a fugitive felon, fleeing prosecution, or violating state or federal conditions of probation or parole. In addition, SSI eligibility is prohibited for 10 years for those convicted of fraudulently claiming residence to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more states.1 Other Eligibility Provisions Citizenship and Residence 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 The individual must reside within izen or an alien lawfully admitted United States under color of law. dar month lose their eligibility for one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and be a citfor permanent residence or permanently residing in the Persons living outside the United States for an entire calensuch a month.  1976 Public Law 94-241, enacted March 24 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Eligibility for SSI is extended to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands, effective January 9, 1978. The income and resources of the immigration sponsors of aliens applying for SSI are considered in determining eligibility for and the amount of payment. After allowances for the needs of the sponsor and his/her family, the remainder is deemed available for the support of the alien applicant for a 3-year period after admission to the United States for permanent residence. This provision does not apply to those who become blind or disabled after admission, to refugees, or to persons granted political asylum. (See ""Deeming of Income and Resources"" on page 30. for subsequent changes to sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions.) SSI eligibility is continued for a disabled or blind child who was receiving SSI benefits while living in the United States and is now living with a parent who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States, but not where the parent is stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Above provision made applicable where the parent is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces and stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Prohibits SSI eligibility for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national unless they are in a ""qualified alien"" category and meet one of certain exceptions such as lawful permanent residents who earn or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of earnings, certain refugee type categories eligible for up to 5 years of time limited eligibility, or active duty U.S. military or veterans and their spouses and children. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996 (the enactment date of the law) for 1 year after the enactment date for those aliens found ineligible under the new standards.  1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  1  This last provision was repealed in 1999 by Public Law 106-169 and replaced with a provision providing for nonpayment of benefits for up to 24 months for making false or misleading statements regarding material facts.  26  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30 1997 Public Law 105-18, enacted June 12  Amends Public Law 104-193 to add to the list of ""qualified aliens"" certain noncitizens (and their children) who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent or a member of the spouse's or parent's family living in the same household. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1997, for those found ineligible under the new alien standards of Public Law 104-193. Further amends Public Law 104-193 to add Cuban and Haitian entrants, and the child of a parent who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, to the list of qualified aliens. Provides that Cuban and Haitian entrants and Amerasian immigrants qualify for time limited eligibility, and increases the time limit from 5 to 7 years for all categories. Additional exceptions are added for qualified aliens: (1) lawfully residing in the United States and receiving SSI benefits on August 22, 1996; and (2) lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996 and meeting the definition of blind or disabled in the Social Security Act. Certain noncitizen American Indians are excepted from the alien nonpayment provisions of Public Law 104-193. Extends eligibility for ""nonqualified aliens"" receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1998.  Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 2000 Public Law 106-386, enacted October 28 1980 Public Law 96-272, enacted June 17  Permanently extends eligibility of all remaining ""nonqualified aliens"" who were receiving SSI benefits when Public Law 104-193 was enacted on August 22, 1996. Noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, may be eligible for SSI as refugees, if they are determined to be victims of ""severe forms of trafficking in persons."" Other Benefits SSI applicants and recipients are not required as a condition of eligibility to elect to receive Veterans Administration pensions under the Veterans and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 if the state of residence lacks a medically needy program under title XIX. Drug Addiction and Alcoholism (DA&A)  1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30  Any disabled individual who has been medically determined to be an alcoholic or drug addict must accept appropriate treatment, if available, in an approved facility and demonstrate compliance with conditions and requirements for treatment. SSI payments are required to be made through a representative payee--another person or public or private agency designated by SSA to manage the recipient's benefit on his/her behalf.  1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15  Any individual who is receiving SSI based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability must comply with the DA&A treatment requirements. The individual must accept appropriate treatment when it is available and comply with the conditions and terms of treatment. Instances of noncompliance with the requirements result in progressively longer payment suspensions. Before payments can resume, the individual must demonstrate compliance for specific periods; 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, for the first, second, third and subsequent instances of noncompliance. An individual who is not in compliance with the DA&A treatment requirements for 12 consecutive months shall not be eligible for payments; however, this does not prevent such individuals from reapplying and again becoming eligible for payments.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  27   SSI: History of Provisions  SSI disability payments based on DA&A are also limited to a total of 36 benefit months (beginning March 1995) regardless of whether appropriate treatment is available. Months for which benefits are not due and received do not count towards the 36-month limit. Payments based on DA&A must be made to a representative payee. Preference is required to be given to community based nonprofit social service agencies and federal, state, or local government agencies in representative payee selection. These agencies when serving as payees for individuals receiving payments based on DA&A may retain the lesser of 10 percent of the monthly benefit or $56 (indexed to the consumer price index (CPI)) as compensation for their services. Establishment of one or more referral and monitoring agencies for each state is required. 1996 Public Law 104-121, enacted March 29 An individual is not considered disabled if DA&A is a contributing factor material to a finding of disability. Applies DA&A representative payee requirements enacted under Public Law 103-296 to disabled SSI recipients who have a DA&A condition and are incapable of managing their benefits. In addition, these recipients shall be referred to the appropriate state agency administering the state plan for substance abuse treatment. Institutionalization 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 An individual who is an inmate of a public institution is ineligible for SSI payments unless the institution is a facility approved for Medicaid payments and is receiving such payments on behalf of the person. Under regulations, the Medicaid payment must represent more than 50 percent of the cost of services provided by the facility to the individual. An inmate of a publicly operated community residence serving no more than 16 persons may, if otherwise eligible, receive SSI. Payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless for a period of up to 3 months in any 12-month period. Effective July 1, 1987, disabled or blind recipients who were receiving special SSI payments or had special SSI recipient status under section 1619 in the month preceding the first full month of institutionalization, may receive payments based on the full federal benefit rate for the initial 2 full months of institutionalization, if they reside in certain public medical, psychiatric or Medicaid facilities, or in private Medicaid facilities. Effective January 1, 1988, payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless, for up to 6 months in a 9-month period. Effective July 1, 1988, continued payment of SSI benefits for up to 3 months is permitted, at the rate that was applicable in the month prior to the first full month of institutionalization, for individuals whose expected institutional stay on admission is not likely to exceed 3 months, as certified by a physician, and for whom the receipt of benefits is necessary to maintain living arrangements to which they may return. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Effective December 1996, institutionalized children under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution may receive no more than $30 per month in federal SSI.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  28  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Vocational Rehabilitation and Treatment 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 Blind or disabled individuals receiving federal SSI benefits who are under age 65, must be referred to the state agency providing services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and must accept the services offered.

Blind or disabled children under age 16 must be referred to the state agency administering crippled children's services or to another agency designated by the state. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Of funds provided for these services, at least 90 percent must be used for children under age 6 or for those who have never attended public schools. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Disabled SSI recipients who medically recover while enrolled in approved vocational rehabilitation programs of state VR agencies, may continue to receive benefits during their participation in such programs if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that continuation in the program will increase the probability that they leave the rolls permanently. Funding no longer provided under title XVI for medical, social, developmental and rehabilitative services to disabled or blind children. Reimbursement for the cost of rehabilitation services will be made if the services result in the recipient's return to work. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 Authorizes the reimbursement of states for the cost of VR services provided to individuals who (1) continue to receive benefits after medical recovery because they are participating in a state VR program or (2) refuse, without good cause, to continue in or cooperate with the VR program in which they had been participating. Provision for continuation of payments to SSI recipients who have medically recovered while enrolled in an approved vocational rehabilitation program extended to blind SSI recipients. Reimbursement authorized for the cost of vocational rehabilitation services provided in months in which the individual was not receiving federal SSI payments, if:  1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5   SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes was retained under work incentive provisions, or   Benefits were in suspense2 status (for a reason other than cessation of disability or blindness), or   Federally administered state supplementation was received. Extends the provision providing for benefit continuation to SSI recipients who medically recover while participating in a state VR program to include SSI recipients participating in a non-state VR program.  2  Recipients who have lost eligibility for SSI benefits for fewer than 13 consecutive months are in suspended payment status.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  29   SSI: History of Provisions  1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17  Establishes a program which will provide SSI (and OASDI) disability beneficiaries with a ticket that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, from an employment network of their choice. Continuing Disability Reviews and Eligibility Redeterminations  1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15  During each of fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, requires SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDRs) on a minimum of 100,000 SSI recipients. In addition, during the same period, requires SSA to redetermine the SSI eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Redeterminations for persons turning age 18 could count toward the 100,000 CDR requirement. Repeals the requirement that SSA redetermine the eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Requires a CDR:  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22   At least once every 3 years for SSI recipients under age 18 who are eligible by reason of an impairment which is likely to improve, and   Not later than 12 months after birth for recipients whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of their disability. Requires eligibility redetermination for all childhood SSI recipients eligible for the month before the month in which they attain age 18. Requires redetermination of eligibility for children considered disabled based on an individual functional assessment and/or consideration of maladaptive behavior. Requires the representative payee of a childhood disability recipient whose continuing eligibility is being reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is receiving treatment which is considered medically necessary and available for the condition which was the basis for providing SSI benefits. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to extend from 12 to 18 months the period for redetermining the disability of children under age 18 under the new childhood disability standard. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to permit SSA to schedule a CDR for a disabled child for whom low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, at a date after the child's first birthday if the Commissioner determines the impairment is not expected to improve within 12 months of the child's birth. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to provide SSA the authority to make redeterminations of disabled childhood recipients who attain age 18, more than 1 year after the date such recipient attains age 18. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Prohibits the initiation of a CDR during the period that a recipient is using a ""ticket"" to work.  Deeming of Income and Resources 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Deeming occurs when the income and resources of certain family members living in the same household with the SSI recipient are considered in determining the amount of the SSI  30  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  payment. These family members are the ineligible spouse of an adult recipient and the ineligible parents of a child recipient under age 21. After deduction of personal allocations for the spouse (or parents) and for ineligible children in the home, and after application of income exclusions, any remaining income of the spouse (or parents) is added to the income of the eligible person. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19 Children aged 18 or older are not subject to parental deeming. Sponsor 's income and resources deemed to an alien for 3 years. Disabled children receiving home care services under state Medicaid programs, who are ineligible for SSI because of deeming of parental income, and who received SSI benefits limited to $30 while in a medical treatment facility may receive the $30 monthly allowance that would be payable if the recipient were institutionalized. Sponsor-to-alien deeming period extended from 3 years to 5 years, effective January 1, 1994, through September 30, 1996. Considers an ineligible spouse or parent who is absent from the household due to active military service to be a member of the household for deeming purposes. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Deeming of income and resources from an immigration sponsor to a noncitizen continues until citizenship, with exceptions for those who earn, or can be credited with, 40 qualifying quarters of earnings. Effective for those whose sponsor signs a new legally enforceable affidavit of support. Amends Public Law 104-193 to add two exceptions to the sponsor-to-alien deeming:  1993 Public Law 103-152, enacted November 24  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30   Provides that if the noncitizen is indigent and would be unable to obtain food and shelter without SSI benefits even after receiving support from the sponsor, then only the amount of income and resources actually provided by the sponsor will be counted for a 12-month period after a determination of indigence; and   Provides that in certain cases, deeming would not apply for a 12-month period (with some options for extension) if the noncitizen (or his/her children) has been battered, or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-208 to add an additional exception to sponsor-to-alien deeming when the parent of a noncitizen has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. Federal Benefit Payments Federal Benefit Rates Basic benefit standards are used in computing the amount of federal SSI payments. Benefit levels differ for individuals and couples living in households and for persons in Medicaid institutions. Individuals or couples living in their own households receive the full federal benefit. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and receiving support and maintenance there, the federal benefit is reduced by one-third. The federal benefit rates for persons in households are increased annually to reflect increases in the cost of living. Legislation affecting the level of federal benefit rates since the inception of the SSI program are summarized in table 2.B1.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  31   SSI: History of Provisions  Windfall Offset 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1984 Public Law 98-617, enacted November 8 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Offset (by reduction of retroactive Social Security benefits) to prevent persons whose initial OASDI payment is retroactive from receiving more in total benefits for the same period than if they were paid the benefits when regularly due. Offset provision expanded to allow for reduction of retroactive SSI benefits and to apply in cases of OASDI benefit reinstatement. Proration of Benefit Benefit for first month of eligibility to be prorated by the number of days in the month for which an application has been filed and there is eligibility. Changes the effective date of an SSI application to the first day of the month following the date on which the application was filed or on which the individual first becomes eligible, whichever is later. This, in effect, eliminates prorated payments in initial claims. Retrospective Monthly Accounting 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to one under which the benefit amount is computed on a monthly basis and is based on income and other characteristics in the previous (or second previous) month. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving title II payments. The effect of the increased title II income at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Provides an exception to retrospective monthly accounting so that amounts received under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), foster care, refugee cash assistance, Cuban-Haitian entrant assistance, or general and child welfare assistance provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are counted only in the month received. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving the value of the one-third reduction. The effect of the increased value at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Effective January 1995. Uncashed Checks 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1987 Public Law 100-86, enacted August 10 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 States that have federally administered supplements to be credited their share of SSI checks that remain unnegotiated for 180 days. SSI checks now unnegotiable after 1 year. States are credited their share of SSI checks after 1 year rather than 180 days. Rounding of Payment Amounts Cost-of-living adjustments in the federal SSI benefit and income eligibility levels are to be rounded to the next lower whole dollar, after the adjustment is calculated. Subsequent costof-living adjustments will be calculated on the previous year 's benefit standard before rounding.  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  32  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Penalties Resulting in Nonpayment of Benefits 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Provides a penalty under the SSI program for the disposal of resources at less than fair market value.

Interim Assistance Reimbursement  1974 Public Law 93-368, enacted August 7 1976 Public Law 94-365, enacted July 14 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  SSA may enter into agreements with the states to repay them directly for assistance payments made to an SSI applicant while his/her claim is being adjudicated. The repayment is made from the first check due to the individual. This legislation expires June 30, 1976. The authority to repay the state for interim assistance is made permanent.  Extends interim assistance reimbursement to situations in which payments are made by states or political subdivisions to persons whose SSI payments were suspended or terminated and who subsequently are found to be eligible for such benefits. Also clarifies that the payment from which the interim assistance reimbursement is paid must be the first payment of benefits relating to the interim period. Medicaid Eligibility  1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30  States can provide Medicaid coverage to all recipients of SSI payments. Alternatively, they can limit coverage by applying more restrictive criteria from the state Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. States can accept SSA determination of eligibility, or make their own determination.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for cash SSI payments due to the cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Blind or disabled recipients under age 65 no longer eligible for either regular or special SSI payments because of their earnings may retain SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes under the following conditions: (1) they continue to have the disabling impairment, (2) they meet all nondisability eligibility criteria except for earned income, (3) they would be seriously inhibited from continuing employment without Medicaid services, and (4) their earnings are insufficient to provide a reasonable equivalent of SSI payments and Medicaid. In states that do not provide Medicaid coverage categorically to all SSI recipients, qualification for Medicaid benefits depends on the state's specific eligibility and program requirements. The Medicaid provision of the 1980 legislation was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Under a 1-year demonstration project, beginning January 1, 1984, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for regular or special SSI payments or for retention of Medicaid eligibility.  1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9  Medicaid provision of 1980 legislation extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984).  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  39   SSI: History of Provisions  1986 Public Law 99-272, enacted April 7  Restores Medicaid eligibility for some disabled widow(er)s who became ineligible for SSI when their title II benefits increased in 1984 because of a change in the Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits reduction factor. The SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility provision of the 1980 amendments is made permanent. Effective July 1, 1987, certain expenses are excluded from earnings when determining sufficiency of earnings to establish SSI recipient status eligibility for Medicaid purposes:  Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10       Impairment-related work expenses of disabled persons, Work expenses of blind persons, Income required for achieving an approved self-support plan, and The value of publicly funded attendant care services.  Effective July 1, 1987, preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for SSI payments because of entitlement to, or an increase in, Social Security disabled adult child benefits on or after the effective date. Effective July 1, 1987, requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for recipients in special SSI status (either receiving special SSI payments or in the special recipient status described for 1980) if they received Medicaid coverage the month before special SSI status. 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Effective July 1, 1988, restores or preserves the Medicaid eligibility of persons aged 60 or older who are eligible for Social Security benefits as widows or widowers (but not eligible for Medicare) and who become ineligible for SSI payments or state supplementation because of the receipt of Old-Age or Survivors Insurance benefits under Social Security. Age limit for retention of SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes is (1980 and subsequent work incentive provisions, above) eliminated. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of SSI recipients who become ineligible for payments when they become entitled to Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits following the revised definition used for their disability. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Requires states to continue Medicaid payments as of August 22, 1996 and except that their eligibility terminated disability standard established under coverage for disabled children who were receiving SSI would have continued to be eligible for such payments because they did not meet the revised SSI childhood Public Law 104-193.  1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5  State Supplementation 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States are given the option of providing supplementary payments both to recipients transferred from the state program and to those newly eligible for SSI. States may either administer the payments themselves or have the Social Security Administration make payments on their behalf. When state supplementary payments are federally administered, the Social Security Administration makes eligibility and payment determinations for the state and assumes administrative costs. ""Hold harmless"" protection, which limits a state's fiscal liability to its share of OAA, AB, and APTD expenditures for calendar year 1972, is provided to states electing federal administration of their supplementary plans. This provision applies only to supplementary payments that do not, on the average, exceed a state's ""adjusted payment level."" (The adjusted pay-  40  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  ment level is the average of the payments that individuals with no other income received in January 1972; it may include the bonus value of food stamps. Adjustments are provided for payments that had been below state standards.) 1973 Public Law 93-66, enacted July 9 Provision is made for mandatory state supplementation as assurance against reduction of income for persons who received state assistance in December 1973 and were transferred to SSI. These supplementary payments must equal the difference between (1) the amount of the state assistance payment that the individual received in December 1973 plus other income and (2) his/her federal SSI payment plus other income. After June 30, 1977, when the federal SSI payment level is increased by a cost-of-living increase, such an increase will be excluded in calculating the ""hold harmless"" amount. Requires states to maintain state supplementation payments at the level of December 1976 (""maintenance of payments"") or to continue to pay in supplements the same total annual amounts (""maintenance of expenditures"") when the federal SSI payment level is increased and thereby pass through any increases in federal benefits without reducing state supplements. 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 Begins a 3-year phase out of ""hold harmless"" protection. Effective with fiscal year 1985, Wisconsin and Hawaii (the only remaining ""hold harmless"" states) assumed the full cost of their supplementary payments. Federal pass-through law is adjusted (1) by substituting the state supplementary payment levels in effect in March 1983 for those in effect in December 1976 as the levels that states must maintain in complying with the pass-through requirements, and (2) with regard to the $20 (individual) and $30 (couple) increase in the federal SSI standard in July 1983, by requiring states to pass through only as much as would have been required if the SSI cost-of-living adjustment had been made in July 1983. Provides for federal administration of state supplements to residents of medical institutions. Provides for required pass through of $5 increase in federal rate for persons whose care in institutions is paid in substantial part by Medicaid. Requires states to pay fees for federal administration of their state supplementation payments. The fees are $1.67 for each monthly supplementary payment in fiscal year 1994, $3.33 in fiscal year 1995, and $5.00 in fiscal year 1996. Fees for subsequent fiscal years will be $5.00 or another amount determined by the Commissioner to be appropriate. The Commissioner may charge the states additional fees for services they request that are beyond the level customarily provided in administering state supplementary payments. Revises the schedule of per-payment fees for federal administration of state supplementation for fiscal years 1998 ($6.20) through 2002 ($8.50) and provides a formula for determining the fee beyond fiscal year 2002. The scheduled fees for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 are $7.60; $7.80; and $8.10, respectively. A state which has an agreement with SSA to administer its supplementation payments, must remit both payments and fees prior to the SSI payment date.  1976 Public Law 94-585, enacted October 21  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  41   SSI: History of Provisions  2000 Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21  Changes the effective date of above provision from 2009 to 2001.  Overpayment Recovery 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 Limits the rate of recovering overpayments from monthly payments to the lesser of (1) the monthly payment, or (2) 10 percent of a recipient's monthly income. Permits a higher or lower adjustment at the request of the recipient subject to the agreement of the Commissioner. The limit does not apply if fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the recipient or spouse in connection with the overpayment. Waives recovery of certain overpayments due to amount of excess resources of $50 or less. Provides for the recovery of overpayments from tax refunds. 1988 Public Law 100-485, enacted October 13 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Extends the authority to recover overpayments from tax refunds.  Authorizes SSA to collect SSI overpayments by offsetting Social Security benefits, with a maximum monthly offset of no more than 10 percent of the Social Security benefit. Makes representative payees liable for an SSI overpayment caused by a payment made to a recipient who has died, and requires SSA to establish an overpayment control record under the representative payee's Social Security number. Requires SSA to recover SSI overpayments from SSI lump-sum amounts by withholding at least 50 percent of the lump-sum payment or the amount of the overpayment, whichever is less. Extends all of the debt collection authorities currently available for the collection of overpayments under the OASDI program to the SSI program.  42  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare  Medicare The following summary of the Medicare program is intended for informational purposes only. It is not an official statement of policy that can be relied upon in lieu of the appropriate law, regulations, and rulings. This narrative is not intended to render legal or other professional advice; therefore, it should not be relied upon for making specific legal decisions. Instead, the law, regulations, and rulings should be consulted for purposes of making such decisions. road Retirement disability benefits for at least 24 months, and government employees with Medicare-only coverage who have been disabled for more than 29 months, are entitled to HI benefits. HI coverage is also provided to insured workers with ESRD (and to insured workers' spouses and children with ESRD), as well as to some otherwise ineligible aged and disabled beneficiaries who voluntarily pay a monthly premium for their coverage. In 2000, the HI program provided protection against the costs of hospital and specific other medical care to about 39 million people (34 million aged and 5 million disabled enrollees). HI benefit payments totaled $128 billion in 2000. The following health care services are covered under the HI program: 0  Overview Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, designated ""Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled,"" is commonly known as Medicare. As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, the Medicare legislation established a health insurance program for aged persons to complement the retirement, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. When first implemented in 1966, Medicare covered most persons aged 65 or older. In 1973, the following groups also became eligible for benefits: persons entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability cash benefits for at least 24 months, most persons with end stage renal disease (ESRD), and certain otherwise noncovered aged persons who elect to pay a premium for Medicare coverage. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106554) allows persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) to waive the 24-month waiting period. Medicare has traditionally consisted of two parts: Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as Part A, and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), also known as Part B. A new, third part of Medicare, sometimes known as Part C, is the Medicare+Choice program, which was established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) and which expanded beneficiaries' options for participation in private-sector health care plans. When Medicare began on July 1, 1966, approximately 19 million people enrolled. In 2001, about 40 million people are enrolled in one or both of Parts A and B of the Medicare program, and 5.7 million of them have chosen to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan.  Coverage HI is generally provided automatically, and free of premiums, to persons aged 65 or older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, whether they have claimed these monthly cash benefits or not. Also, workers and their spouses with a sufficient period of Medicare-only coverage in federal, state, or local government employment are eligible beginning at age 65. Similarly, individuals who have been entitled to Social Security or Rail-   Inpatient hospital care coverage includes costs of a semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating and recovery rooms, intensive care, inpatient prescription drugs, laboratory tests, X-rays, psychiatric hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, and longterm care (LTC) hospitalization when medically necessary, as well as all other medically necessary services and supplies provided in the hospital. An initial deductible payment is required of beneficiaries who are admitted to a hospital, plus copayments for all hospital days following day 60 within a benefit period (described later).  Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is covered by HI only if it follows within 30 days (generally) of a hospitalization of 3 days or more and is certified as medically necessary. Covered services are similar to those for inpatient hospital care but also include rehabilitation services and appliances. The number of SNF days provided under Medicare is limited to 100 days per benefit period (described later), with a copayment required for days 21100. HI does not cover nursing facility care if the patient does not require skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation services.  Home health agency (HHA) care is covered by both HI and SMI. The BBA transferred from HI to SMI those home health services furnished on or after January 1, 1998 that are unassociated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. HI will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a 3-day hospital stay or a skilled nursing facility stay; SMI covers any visits thereafter. Home health care under HI and SMI has no copayment and no deductible. HHA care, including care provided by a home health aide, may be furnished part-time by a HHA in the residence of a home-bound beneficiary if intermittent or part-time skilled nursing and/or certain other therapy or rehabilitation care is necessary. Certain medical supplies and durable  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  43   Medicare medical equipment (DME) may also be provided, though beneficiaries must pay a 20-percent coinsurance for DME, as required under SMI. There must be a plan of treatment and periodical review by a physician. Full-time nursing care, food, blood, and drugs are not provided as HHA services. 0 0   Hospice care is a service provided to terminally ill persons with life expectancies of 6 months or less who elect to forego the standard Medicare benefits for treatment of their illness and to receive only hospice care for it. Such care includes pain relief, supportive medical and social services, physical therapy, nursing services, and symptom management. However, if a hospice patient requires treatment for a condition that is not related to the terminal illness, Medicare will pay for all covered services necessary for that condition. The beneficiary pays no deductible for the hospice program, but does pay small coinsurance amounts for drugs and inpatient respite care. An important HI component is the benefit period, which starts when the beneficiary first enters a hospital and ends when there has been a break of at least 60 consecutive days since inpatient hospital or skilled nursing care was provided. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods covered by HI during a beneficiary's lifetime; however, inpatient hospital care is normally limited to 90 days during a benefit period, and copayment requirements (detailed later) apply for days 6190. If a beneficiary exhausts the 90 days of inpatient hospital care available in a benefit period, he or she can elect to use days of Medicare coverage from a nonrenewable ""lifetime reserve"" of up to 60 (total) additional days of inpatient hospital care. Copayments are also required for such additional days. All citizens (and certain legal aliens) aged 65 or older, and all disabled persons entitled to coverage under HI, are eligible to enroll in the SMI program on a voluntary basis by payment of a monthly premium. Almost all persons entitled to HI choose to enroll in SMI. In 2000, the SMI program provided protection against the costs of physician and other medical services to about 37 million people (32 million aged and 5 million disabled). SMI benefits totaled $88.9 billion in 2000. The SMI program covers the following services and supplies: 0  ration with a physician.  Services in an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including same-day surgery, and ambulance services.  Home health care not covered under HI.  Laboratory tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic radiology services, as well as certain preventive care screening tests.  Ambulatory surgical center services in a Medicareapproved facility.  Most physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology services.  Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, and mental health care in a partial hospitalization psychiatric program, if a physician certifies that inpatient treatment would be required without it.  Radiation therapy, renal (kidney) dialysis and transplants, heart, lung, heart-lung, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow transplants, and, as of April 2001, intestinal transplants.  Approved durable medical equipment for home use, such as oxygen equipment and wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and surgical dressings, splints, and casts.  Drugs and biologicals that cannot be self-administered, such as hepatitis B vaccines and immunosuppressive drugs (certain self-administered anticancer drugs are covered). To be covered, all services must be either medically necessary or one of several prescribed preventive benefits. SMI services are generally subject to a deductible and coinsurance (see next section). Certain medical services and related care are subject to special payment rules, including deductibles (for blood), maximum approved amounts (for Medicare-approved physical, speech, or occupational therapy services performed after 2002 in settings other than hospitals), and higher cost-sharing requirements (such as those for outpatient treatments for mental illness). It should be noted that some health care services are not covered by Medicare. Noncovered services include long-term nursing care, custodial care, and certain other health care needs, such as dentures and dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and most prescription drugs. These services are not a part of the Medicare program unless they are a part of a private health plan under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare+Choice (Part C) is an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare. While all Medicare beneficiaries can receive their benefits through the original fee-for-service (FFS) program, most beneficiaries enrolled in both HI and SMI can choose to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan instead. Organiza-   Physicians' and surgeons' services, including some covered services furnished by chiropractors, podiatrists, dentists, and optometrists. Also covered are the services provided by these Medicare-approved practitioners who are not physicians: certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers (other than in a hospital or skilled nursing facility), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in collabo-  44  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare tions that seek to contract as Medicare+Choice plans must meet specific organizational, financial, and other requirements. Following are the primary Medicare+Choice plans: 0   Coordinated care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other certified coordinated care plans and entities that meet the standards set forth in the law.  Private, unrestricted FFS plans, which allow beneficiaries to select certain private providers. For those providers who agree to accept the plan's payment terms and conditions, this option does not place the providers at risk, nor does it vary payment rates based on utilization.  Medical savings account (MSA) plans, which provide benefits after a single high deductible is met. Medicare makes an annual deposit to the MSA, and the beneficiary is expected to use the money in the MSA to pay for medical expenses below the annual deductible. MSAs are currently a test program for a limited number of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide at least the current Medicare benefit package, excluding hospice services. Plans may offer additional covered services and are required to do so (or return excess payments) if plan costs are lower than the Medicare payments received by the plan. There are some restrictions as to who may elect an MSA plan, even when enrollment is no longer limited to a certain number of participants.  Program Financing, Beneficiary Liabilities, and Provider Payments All financial operations for Medicare are handled through two trust funds, one for the HI program and one for the SMI program. These trust funds, which are special accounts in the U.S. Treasury, are credited with all receipts and charged with all expenditures for benefits and administrative costs. The trust funds cannot be used for any other purpose. Assets not needed for the payment of costs are invested in special Treasury securities. The following sections describe Medicare's financing provisions, beneficiary cost-sharing requirements, and the basis for determining Medicare reimbursements to health care providers. Program Financing The HI program is financed primarily through a mandatory payroll tax. Almost all employees and self-employed workers in the United States work in employment covered by the HI program and pay taxes to support the cost of benefits for aged and disabled beneficiaries. The HI tax rate is 1.45 percent of earnings, to be paid by each employee and a matching amount by the employer for each employee,  and 2.90 percent for self-employed persons. Beginning in 1994, this tax is paid on all covered wages and selfemployment income without limit. (Prior to 1994, the tax applied only up to a specified maximum amount of earnings.) The HI tax rate is specified in the Social Security Act and cannot be changed without legislation. The HI trust fund also receives income from the following sources: (1) a portion of the income taxes levied on Social Security benefits paid to high-income beneficiaries; (2) premiums from certain persons who are not otherwise eligible and choose to enroll voluntarily; (3) reimbursements from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for the cost of providing HI coverage to certain aged persons who retired when the HI program began and thus were unable to earn sufficient quarters of coverage (and those federal retirees similarly unable to earn sufficient quarters of Medicare-qualified federal employment); (4) interest earnings on its invested assets; and (5) other small miscellaneous income sources. The taxes paid each year are used mainly to pay benefits for current beneficiaries. The SMI program is financed through premium payments ($50 per beneficiary per month in 2001) and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Beneficiary premiums are generally set at a level that covers 25 percent of the average expenditures for aged beneficiaries. Therefore, the contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury are the largest source of SMI income. The SMI trust fund also receives income from interest earnings on its invested assets, as well as a small amount of miscellaneous income. Beneficiary premiums and general fund payments are redetermined annually, to match estimated program costs for the following year. Capitation payments to Medicare+Choice plans are financed from the HI and SMI trust funds in proportion to the relative weights of HI and SMI benefits to the total benefits paid by the Medicare program. Beneficiary Payment Liabilities Fee-for-service beneficiaries are responsible for charges not covered by the Medicare program and for various cost-sharing aspects of both HI and SMI. These liabilities may be paid (1) by the Medicare beneficiary; (2) by a third party, such as an employer-sponsored retiree health plan or private ""Medigap"" insurance; or (3) by Medicaid, if the person is eligible. The term Medigap is used to mean private health insurance that pays, within limits, most of the health care service charges not covered by Parts A or B of Medicare. These policies, which must meet federally imposed standards, are offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BC/BS) and various commercial health insurance companies. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans, the beneficiary's payment share is based on the cost-sharing structure of the specific plan selected by the beneficiary, since each plan has its own requirements. Most plans  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  45   Medicare have lower deductibles and coinsurance than are required of fee-for-service beneficiaries. Such beneficiaries pay the monthly Part B premium and may, depending on the plan, pay an additional plan premium. For hospital care covered under HI, a fee-for-service beneficiary's payment share includes a one-time deductible amount at the beginning of each benefit period ($792 in 2001). This deductible covers the beneficiary's part of the first 60 days of each spell of inpatient hospital care. If continued inpatient care is needed beyond the 60 days, additional coinsurance payments ($198 per day in 2001) are required through the 90th day of a benefit period. Each HI beneficiary also has a ""lifetime reserve"" of 60 additional hospital days that may be used when the covered days within a benefit period have been exhausted. Lifetime reserve days may be used only once, and coinsurance payments ($396 per day in 2001) are required. For skilled nursing care covered under HI, Medicare fully covers the first 20 days of SNF care in a benefit period. But for days 21100, a copayment ($99 per day in 2001) is required from the beneficiary. After 100 days of SNF care per benefit period, Medicare pays nothing for SNF care. Home health care has no deductible or coinsurance payment by the beneficiary. In any HI service, the beneficiary is responsible for fees to cover the first 3 pints or units of nonreplaced blood per calendar year. The beneficiary has the option of paying the fee or of having the blood replaced. There are no premiums for most people covered by the HI program. Eligibility is generally earned through the work experience of the beneficiary or of his or her spouse. However, most aged people who are otherwise ineligible for premium-free HI coverage can enroll voluntarily by paying a monthly premium, if they also enroll in SMI. For people with fewer than 30 quarters of coverage as defined by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the 2001 HI monthly premium rate is $300; for those with 30 to 39 quarters of coverage, the rate is reduced to $165. Voluntary coverage upon payment of the HI premium, with or without enrolling in SMI, is also available to disabled individuals for whom cash benefits have ceased due to earnings in excess of those allowed for receiving cash benefits. For SMI, the beneficiary's payment share includes the following: one annual deductible (currently $100); the monthly premiums; the coinsurance payments for SMI services (usually 20 percent of the medically allowed charges); a deductible for blood; certain charges above the Medicare-allowed charge (for claims not on assignment); and payment for any services that are not covered by Medicare. For outpatient mental health treatment services, the beneficiary is liable for 50 percent of the approved charges. Provider Payments For HI, before 1983, payments to providers were made on a reasonable cost basis. Medicare payments for most inpatient hospital services are now made under a reimbursement mechanism known as the prospective payment system (PPS). Under PPS, a specific predetermined amount is paid for each inpatient hospital stay, based on each stay's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification. In some cases the payment the hospital receives is less than the hospital's actual cost for providing the HI-covered inpatient hospital services for the stay; in other cases it is more. The hospital absorbs the loss or makes a profit. Certain payment adjustments exist for extraordinarily costly inpatient hospital stays. Payments for skilled nursing care and home health care are made under separate prospective payment systems. Payments for inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric care are currently reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, but prospective payment systems are expected to be implemented in the near future, as required by the BBA. For SMI, before 1992, physicians were paid on the basis of reasonable charge. This amount was initially defined as the lowest of (1) the physician's actual charge; (2) the physician's customary charge; or (3) the prevailing charge for similar services in that locality. Beginning January 1992, allowed charges were defined as the lesser of (1) the submitted charges, or (2) the amount determined by a fee schedule based on a relative value scale (RVS). Payments for DME and clinical laboratory services are also based on a fee schedule. Most hospital outpatient services are reimbursed on a prospective payment system, and home health care is reimbursed under the same prospective payment system as HI. If a doctor or supplier agrees to accept the Medicareapproved rate as payment in full (""takes assignment""), then payments provided must be considered as payments in full for that service. The provider may not request any added payments (beyond the initial annual deductible and coinsurance) from the beneficiary or insurer. If the provider does not take assignment, the beneficiary will be charged for the excess (which may be paid by Medigap insurance). Limits now exist on the excess that doctors or suppliers can charge. Physicians are ""participating physicians"" if they agree before the beginning of the year to accept assignment for all Medicare services they furnish during the year. Since Medicare beneficiaries may select their doctors, they have the option to choose those who participate. Medicare payments to Medicare+Choice plans are based on a blend of local and national capitated rates, generally determined by the capitation payment methodology described in section 1853 of the Social Security Act. Actual payments to plans vary based on demographic characteristics of the enrolled population. New ""risk adjusters"" based on demographics and health status are currently being phased in to better match Medicare capitation payments to the expected costs of individual beneficiaries.  46  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare  Claims Processing Medicare's HI and SMI fee-for-service claims are processed by nongovernment organizations or agencies that contract to serve as the fiscal agent between providers and the federal government. These claims processors are known as intermediaries and carriers. They apply the Medicare coverage rules to determine the appropriateness of claims. Medicare intermediaries process HI claims for institutional services, including inpatient hospital claims, SNFs, HHAs, and hospice services. They also process outpatient hospital claims for SMI. Examples of intermediaries are BC/ BS (which utilize their plans in various states) and other commercial insurance companies. Intermediaries' responsibilities include the following: 0  as new authorities to contract with entities to perform specific payment safeguard functions.  Administration The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the overall responsibility for administration of the Medicare program. Within HHS, responsibility for administering Medicare rests with CMS. SSA assists, however, by initially determining an individual's Medicare entitlement, by withholding Part B premiums from the Social Security benefit checks of beneficiaries, and by maintaining Medicare data on the Master Beneficiary Record, which is SSA's primary record of beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury collects the HI payroll taxes from workers and their employers. A Board of Trustees, composed of two appointed members of the public and four members who serve by virtue of their positions in the federal government, oversees the financial operations of the HI and SMI trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is the managing trustee. The Board of Trustees reports to Congress on the financial and actuarial status of the Medicare trust funds on or about the first day of April each year. State agencies (usually State Health Departments under agreements with CMS) identify, survey, and inspect provider and supplier facilities and institutions wishing to participate in the Medicare program. In consultation with CMS, these agencies then certify the facilities that are qualified.       Determining costs and reimbursement amounts. Maintaining records. Establishing controls. Safeguarding against fraud and abuse or excess use.  Conducting reviews and audits.  Making the payments to providers for services.  Assisting both providers and beneficiaries as needed. Medicare carriers handle SMI claims for services by physicians and medical suppliers. Examples of carriers are the BS plans in a state, and various commercial insurance companies. Carriers' responsibilities include the following: 0  Data Summary The Medicare program covers 95 percent of our nation's aged population, as well as many people who are on Social Security because of disability. In 2000, HI covered about 39 million enrollees with benefit payments of $128.5 billion, and SMI covered 37 million enrollees with benefit payments of $88.9 billion. Administrative costs were about 2 percent of HI and about 2 percent of SMI disbursements for 2000. Total disbursements for Medicare in 2000 were $222 billion. 0        Determining charges allowed by Medicare. Maintaining quality-of-performance records. Assisting in fraud and abuse investigations. Assisting both suppliers and beneficiaries as needed. Making payments to physicians and suppliers for services that are covered under SMI.  Peer review organizations (PROs) are groups of practicing health care professionals who are paid by the federal government to generally oversee the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries in each state and to improve the quality of services. PROs educate other health care professionals and assist in the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services to the Medicare population. The ongoing effort to combat monetary fraud and abuse in the Medicare program was intensified after enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), which created the Medicare Integrity Program. Prior to this 1996 legislation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was limited by law to contracting with its current carriers and fiscal intermediaries to perform payment safeguard activities. The Medicare Integrity Program provided CMS with stable, increasing funding for payment safeguard activities, as well  Note: Medicare enrollment data are based on estimates prepared for the 2001 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees to Congress (available on the Internet at www.hcfa.gov/pubforms/tr/). Medicare benefits, administrative costs, and total disbursements for 2000 are actual amounts for the calendar year, as reported by the Department of the Treasury.

Disabled individual under age 65 entitled to disability benefits for at least 24 months, not necessarily consecutive, under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program. Medicare coverage extended for up to 36 months for disabled individuals whose disability continues, but whose monthly benefit ceased because they engaged in substantial gainful activity. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled-worker beneficiary becomes entitled again within 5 years (7 years for disabled widows and widowers and disabled children aged 18 or older). 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 Federal employees covered under HI based on QC for earnings as federal employees and/ or based on deemed QC for earnings as federal employees before 1983. Employees of nonprofit organizations, effective Jan. 1, 1984. Mandatory coverage for state and local government employees not covered under Social Security and hired after Mar. 31, 1986. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled beneficiary becomes entitled again (no time limit). Disabled individuals under age 65 who are no longer entitled to Social Security disability benefits because their earnings exceeded the substantial gainful activity level have the option to purchase Medicare coverage by paying the HI and SMI premiums. The 24-month waiting period (otherwise required for an individual to establish Medicare eligibility on the basis of a disability) is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, effective July 1, 2001.  1967 1972  2000  *  Act refers to legislation enacted in the year shown.  48  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions Entitlement to Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits 1965 U.S. resident (citizen or lawfully admitted alien with 5 years continuous residence) aged 65 or older or any individual entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Individual under age 65 entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Medicare Benefits HI and SMI 1965 1981 Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to benefits provided by liability insurance policies or under no-fault insurance. Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for up to 12 months. For workers and their spouses aged 65-69, Medicare is the secondary payer when benefits are provided under an employer-based group health plan (applicable to employers with 20 or more employees who sponsor or contribute to the group plan). Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) will be authorized as providers of benefits. The Secretary of HHS must certify the prospective payment mechanism for HMOs before implementation. 1984 Medicare secondary payer provisions are extended to spouses aged 65-69 of workers under age 65 whose employer-based group health plan covers such spouses. For HMOs, includes medical and other health services furnished by clinical psychologists. 1985 1986 Provides payment for liver transplant services. Extends the working age secondary payer provision to cover workers and their spouses beyond age 69. For HMOs that offered organ transplants as a basic health service on Apr. 15, 1985, such services may be offered from Oct. 1, 1985, through Apr. 1, 1988. For disabled individuals who are covered by employer-based health plans (with at least 100 employees), Medicare is the secondary payer, effective for 1987-91. 1987 Requires HMOs/competitive medical plans that cease to contract with Medicare to provide or arrange supplemental coverage of benefits related to preexisting conditions for the lesser of 6 months or the duration of an exclusion period. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Clarifies that the secondary payer provision for disabled individuals covered under employerbased health plans for employers with at least 500 employees applies to employers who are government entities. 1990 Requires that Medicare be the secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to ESRD for up to 18 months (extended from 12 months), effective Feb. 1, 1991, to Jan. 1, 1996. The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans (see 1986.); effective through Sept. 30, 1995. 1993 The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans is effective through Sept. 30, 1998.  1972  1982  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  49   Medicare: History of Provisions The secondary payer provision for beneficiaries with ESRD applies to all beneficiaries with end stage renal disease, not only those entitled to Medicare solely on the basis of it. The extension to include the first 18 months of an individual's entitlement on the basis of ESRD is effective through Sept. 30, 1998. 1997 Established an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare, referred to as Medicare+Choice. All Medicare beneficiaries can receive their Medicare benefits through the original fee-for-service program. In addition, most beneficiaries can choose instead to receive their Medicare benefits through one of the following Medicare+Choice plans: (1) coordinated care plans (such as HMOs, provider-sponsored organizations, and preferred provider organizations); (2) Medical Savings Account (MSA)/ High Deductible plans (through a demonstration available for up to 390,000 beneficiaries); or (3) private fee-for-service plans. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide the current Medicare benefit package (excluding hospice services) and any additional health services required under the adjusted community rate (ACR) process. MSA plans provide Medicare benefits after a single high deductible is met, and enrollees receive an annual deposit in their Medical Savings Account. Transition rules for current Medicare HMO program also provided. The provision making Medicare the secondary payer for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans, previously scheduled to expire Sept. 30, 1998, made permanent. The provision making Medicare secondary payer for the first 12 months of entitlement due to ESRD, which had been extended on a temporary basis (through Sept. 30, 1998) to include the first 18 months of entitlement, has been extended, permanently, to include the first 30 months of entitlement on the basis of ESRD. Hospital Insurance 1965 In each benefit period, inpatient hospital services, 90 days.

Inpatient psychiatric hospital care limited to 190-day lifetime maximum. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services. Post-hospital extended-care services, 100 days (including physical, occupational, and speech therapy). Post-hospital home health services, 100 visits. Deductible and coinsurance provisions (see table 2.C1). Lifetime reserve of 60 additional days of inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services transferred to SMI. Services of interns and residents in podiatry training. Unlimited home health visits in a year. Requirement for prior hospitalization eliminated. Home health services provided for up to 4 days a week and up to 21 consecutive days. Alcohol detoxification facility services. 1981 Part A coinsurance is based on the deductible for the calendar year in which services are received rather than the deductible in effect at the time the beneficiary's spell of illness began, starting in 1982. Alcohol detoxification facility services eliminated. 1982 Beneficiaries expected to live 6 months or less may elect to receive hospice care benefits instead of other Medicare benefits. May elect maximum of two 90-day and one 30-day hospice care periods, effective Nov. 1, 1983, to Oct. 1, 1986. For durable medical equipment provided by home health agencies, the payment amount is reduced from 100 percent of costs to 80 percent of reasonable charges.  1967 1972 1980  1984  50  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions 1986 Set the Part A deductible for 1987 at $520 with resulting increases in cost sharing. Increased the Part A deductible annually by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital prospective payment rates. Hospice care benefit (enacted in 1982) made permanent. 1987 Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Enrollee pays annual hospital deductible (set at $560 for 1989) and Medicare pays balance of covered charges, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization (except for psychiatric hospital care, which is still limited by 190-day lifetime maximum). The number of days in a skilled nursing facility changed to 150 per year. Deletes the requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days. Expands home health care to provide care for less than 7 days per week and up to 38 consecutive days. Hospice care extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. All 1988 provisions became effective Jan. 1, 1989. 1989 The spell of illness and benefit period coverage of laws determination of inpatient hospital benefits in 1990 and benefit period, Medicare pays 100 percent of covered c hospital care. Coinsurance applies for the next 30 days prior to 1988 return to the later. After the deductible is paid in osts for the first 60 days of inpatient in a benefit period.  1988  The requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days is reinstated for skilled nursing facility services. Coverage returns to 100 days post-hospital care per spell of illness with a daily coinsurance rate in effect for days 21 through 100. Home health services return to a limit of 21 consecutive days of care. Provision providing for home health care for fewer than 7 days per week continued due to a court decision. Hospice care is returned to a lifetime limit of 210 days. 1990 1997 Hospice care is extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled-nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI trust fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period (that is, the HI trust fund will transfer funds to the SMI trust fund during that period). Limits on the number of hours and days that home health care can be provided have been clarified. ""Part-time"" now defined as skilled-nursing and home health aide services (combined) furnished any number of days per week, for less than 8 hours per day and 28 or fewer hours per week. ""Intermittent"" now defined as skilled-nursing care provided for fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours each day (combined) for 21 days or less. Hospice benefit periods are restructured to include two 90-day periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60-day periods. Medicare coverage provided for a number of prevention initiatives, most of which covered under SMI program. HI program affected mainly by two of the initiatives: (1) annual prostate cancer screening for male beneficiaries aged 50 or older, effective Jan. 1, 2000; and (2) colorectal screening procedures, including fecal-occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopies, for beneficiaries age 50 or older, colonoscopy for beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal cancer, and other procedures, including screening barium enemas under certain circumstances.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  51   Medicare: History of Provisions 2000 Screening colonoscopies are covered for all beneficiaries, not just those at high risk, beginning July 1, 2001. For persons not at high risk, a screening colonoscopy is covered 10 years after a previous one, or 4 years after a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy. (See 1997.) Supplementary Medical Insurance 1965 Physician and surgeon services. In-hospital services of anesthesiologists, pathologists, radiologists, and psychiatrists. Limited dental services. Home health services, 100 visits in calendar year. Other medical services including various diagnostic tests, limited ambulance services, prosthetic devices, rental of durable medical equipment used at home (including equipment for dialysis), and supplies used for fractures.

Includes occupational therapy services provided in certain delivery settings. For ambulatory surgical procedures performed in ambulatory surgical centers, hospital outpatient departments, and certain physician offices, the Part B coinsurance and deductible are no longer waived. 1987 Increases the maximum payment for mental health services and includes outpatient mental health services provided by ambulatory hospital-based or hospital-affiliated programs under the supervision of a physician.  52  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions Services provided by clinical social workers when furnished by risk-sharing health maintenance organizations/competitive medical plans, physician assistants in rural health manpower shortage areas, clinical psychologists in rural health clinics and community mental health centers, and certified nurse-midwives. Coverage of outpatient immunosuppresive drugs (see 1986) is broadened/clarifed to include prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). 1988 Beginning Jan. 1, 1990, the beneficiary pays a $75 deductible and 20-percent coinsurance, but once out-of-pocket expenses for the deductible and coinsurance exceed $1,370, Medicare pays 100 percent of allowable charges for remainder of year. Beginning in 1991, Medicare pays 50 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs above $600. When fully implemented in 1993, Medicare will pay 80 percent of prescription drug costs above a deductible that assumes that 16.8 percent of Part B enrollees will exceed the deductible. Certain prescription drugs administered in an outpatient or home setting, including immunosuppressive drugs (previously covered for 1 year after a covered transplant), home intravenous drugs, and certain others, will be covered in 1990 under a new prescription drug provision. 1989 Provisions enacted in 1988 and to begin in 1990 and 1991 are repealed and benefits are restored to levels in effect prior to Jan. 1, 1989. Limits on mental health benefits eliminated in 1990. Coverage extended to services of clinical psychologists and social workers. The annual payment limits of $500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $750, for 1990 and later. (See 1980.) 1990 Beginning in 1991, routine mammography screenings are covered. The Part B deductible is set at $100 in 1991 and subsequent years.

The annual payment limits of $750 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $900 for 1994 and later. (See 1989.) 1997 Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI Trust Fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period, while the cost of the home health services will phase into the SMI premium over 7 years.

A separate $1,500 limit will also apply to outpatient occupational therapy services, except for services furnished by hospital outpatient departments. Beginning with 2002, these caps will be increased by the percentage increase in the Medical Economic Index. (See 1993.) 1999 The coverage period for immunosuppressive drugs after a transplant is lengthened to 44 months, for individuals who exhaust their 36 months of coverage in 2000. For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2001, at least 8 more months will be covered. (The Secretary of HHS will specify the increase, if any, beyond 8 months.) For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2002, 2003, or 2004, the number of additional months may be more or less than 8. (The Secretary will specify the increase for each of these years.) (See 1993.) The annual payment limits of $1,500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, for services furnished by independent practitioners (that is, not by a hospital outpatient department), are suspended for 2000 and 2001. (See 1997.) 2000 Coverage for screening pap smears and pelvic exams (including a clinical breast exam) is provided every 2 years (increased from every 3 years) beginning July 1, 2001.

Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. For calculating the amount of SMI premium surcharge for individuals from age 65 up to age 70 not previously enrolled in SMI, the number of years an individual did not enroll because of coverage by employer group health insurance will not be taken into account. 1985 Extends through calendar year 1988 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs and that increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Premium-paying individuals who do not purchase Part A coverage within a specific time after becoming eligible because of age are subject to a 10-percent penalty for each 12 months they are late in enrolling. There is a cutoff on the length of time these individuals will have to pay an enrollment penalty. The 10-percent premium penalty would be limited to twice the number of years enrollment was delayed. Therefore, if enrollment were delayed 1 year, the penalty would be assessed for 2 years. Individuals in this category and already enrolled will have the length of time the higher premium was paid credited to them. 1987 Extends through calendar year 1989 the provisions requiring that the SMI premium be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs, prohibiting any increase in the premium if there is no Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, and continuing to hold beneficiaries harmless from Social Security check reductions as a result of a premium increase.

It is not an official statement of policy that can be relied upon in lieu of the appropriate law, regulations, and rulings. This narrative is not intended to render legal or other professional advice; therefore, it should not be relied upon for making specific legal decisions. Instead, the law, regulations, and rulings should be consulted for purposes of making such decisions. related groups not receiving cash payments. In addition to their Medicaid programs, most states have additional ""state-only"" programs to provide medical assistance for specified poor persons who do not qualify for Medicaid. Federal funds are not provided for state-only programs. The following enumerates the mandatory Medicaid ""categorically needy"" eligibility groups for which federal matching funds are provided: 0  Overview 0  Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal/state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture jointly funded by the federal and state governments (including the District of Columbia and the territories) to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America's poorest people. Within broad national guidelines established by federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each state (1) establishes its own eligibility standards; (2) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; (3) sets the rate of payment for services; and (4) administers its own program. Medicaid policies for eligibility, services, and payment are complex and vary considerably, even among states of similar size or geographic proximity. Thus, a person who is eligible for Medicaid in one state may not be eligible in another state, and the services provided by one state may differ considerably in amount, duration, or scope from services provided in a similar or neighboring state. In addition, state legislatures may change Medicaid eligibility and/or services during the year.   Individuals are generally eligible for Medicaid if they meet the requirements for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996, or--at state option--more liberal criteria.  Children under age 6 whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).  Pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the FPL (services to these women are limited to those related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care).  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in most states (some states use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements that pre-date SSI).  Recipients of adoption or foster care assistance under title IV of the Social Security Act.  Special protected groups (typically individuals who lose their cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits, but who may keep Medicaid for a period of time).  All children born after September 30, 1983 who are under age 19, in families with incomes at or below the FPL (this process phases in coverage, so that by the year 2002 all such poor children under age 19 will be covered).  Certain Medicare beneficiaries (described later). States also have the option of providing Medicaid coverage for other ""categorically related"" groups. These optional groups share characteristics of the mandatory groups (that is, they fall within defined categories), but the eligibility criteria are somewhat more liberally defined. The broadest optional groups for which states will receive federal matching funds for coverage under the Medicaid program include the following: 0  Basis of Eligibility and Maintenance Assistance Status Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Under the broadest provisions of the federal statute, Medicaid does not provide health care services even for very poor persons unless they are in one of the groups designated below. Low income is only one test for Medicaid eligibility for those within these groups; their resources also are tested against threshold levels (as determined by each state within federal guidelines). States generally have broad discretion in determining which groups their Medicaid programs will cover and the financial criteria for Medicaid eligibility. To be eligible for federal funds, however, states are required to provide Medicaid coverage for certain individuals who receive federally assisted income-maintenance payments, as well as for   Infants up to age 1 and pregnant women not covered under the mandatory rules whose family income is no more than 185 percent of the FPL (the percentage amount is set by each state).  Children under age 21 who meet the AFDC income and resources requirements that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  57   Medicaid  Institutionalized individuals eligible under a ""special income level"" (the amount is set by each state--up to 300 percent of the SSI federal benefit rate).  Individuals who would be eligible if institutionalized, but who are receiving care under home and community-based services waivers.  Certain aged, blind, or disabled adults who have incomes above those requiring mandatory coverage, but below the FPL.  Recipients of state supplementary income payments.  Certain working-and-disabled persons with family income less than 250 percent of the FPL who would qualify for SSI if they did not work.  TB-infected persons who would be financially eligible for Medicaid at the SSI income level if they were within a Medicaid-covered category (however, coverage is limited to TB-related ambulatory services and TB drugs).  ""Optional targeted low-income children"" included within the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33).  ""Medically needy"" persons (described below). The medically needy (MN) option allows states to extend Medicaid eligibility to additional persons. These persons would be eligible for Medicaid under one of the mandatory or optional groups, except that their income and/or resources are above the eligibility level set by their state. Persons may qualify immediately or may ""spend down"" by incurring medical expenses that reduce their income to or below their state's MN income level. Medicaid eligibility and benefit provisions for the medically needy do not have to be as extensive as for the categorically needy, and may be quite restrictive. Federal matching funds are available for MN programs. However, if a state elects to have a MN program, there are federal requirements that certain groups and certain services must be included; that is, children under age 19 and pregnant women who are medically needy must be covered, and prenatal and delivery care for pregnant women, as well as ambulatory care for children, must be provided. A state may elect to provide MN eligibility to certain additional groups and may elect to provide certain additional services within its MN program. Currently, 38 states have elected to have a MN program and are providing at least some MN services to at least some MN recipients. All remaining states utilize the ""special income level"" option to extend Medicaid to the ""near poor"" in medical institutional settings. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)--known as the ""welfare reform"" bill--made restrictive changes regarding eligibility for SSI coverage that impacted the Medicaid program. For example, legal resident aliens and other qualified aliens who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996 are ineligible for Medicaid for 5 years. Medicaid coverage for most aliens entering before that date and coverage for those eligible after the 5-year ban are state options; emergency services, however, are mandatory for both of these alien coverage groups. For aliens who lose SSI benefits because of the new restrictions regarding SSI coverage, Medicaid can continue only if these persons can be covered for Medicaid under some other eligibility status (again with the exception of emergency services, which are mandatory). Public Law 104-193 also affected a number of disabled children, who lost SSI as a result of the restrictive changes; however, their eligibility for Medicaid was reinstituted by Public Law 105-33, the BBA. In addition, welfare reform repealed the open-ended federal entitlement program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides states with grants to be spent on time-limited cash assistance. TANF generally limits a family's lifetime cash welfare benefits to a maximum of 5 years and permits states to impose a wide range of other requirements as well--in particular, those related to employment. However, the impact on Medicaid eligibility is not expected to be significant. Under welfare reform, persons who would have been eligible for AFDC under the AFDC requirements in effect on July 16, 1996 generally will still be eligible for Medicaid. Although most persons covered by TANF will receive Medicaid, it is not required by law. Title XXI of the Social Security Act, known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), is a new program initiated by the BBA. In addition to allowing states to craft or expand an existing state insurance program, SCHIP provides more federal funds for states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include a greater number of children who are currently uninsured. With certain exceptions, these are low-income children who would not qualify for Medicaid based on the plan that was in effect on April 15, 1997. Funds from SCHIP also may be used to provide medical assistance to children during a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid. This is one of several options from which states may select to provide health care coverage for more children, as prescribed within the BBA's Title XXI program. Medicaid coverage may begin as early as the third month prior to application--if the person would have been eligible for Medicaid had he or she applied during that time. Medicaid coverage generally stops at the end of the month in which a person no longer meets the criteria of any Medicaid eligibility group. The BBA allows states to provide 12 months of continuous Medicaid coverage (without reevaluation) for eligible children under the age of 19. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-170) provides or continues  58  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicaid Medicaid coverage to certain disabled beneficiaries who work despite their impairment. Those with higher incomes may pay a sliding scale premium based on income. offers and manages all health, medical, and social services and mobilizes other services as needed to provide preventative, rehabilitative, curative, and supportive care. This care, provided in day health centers, homes, hospitals, and nursing homes, helps the person maintain independence, dignity, and quality of life. PACE functions within the Medicare program as well. Regardless of source of payment, PACE providers receive payment only through the PACE agreement and must make available all items and services covered under both titles XVIII and XIX, without amount, duration, or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles, copayments, or other cost sharing. The individuals enrolled in PACE receive benefits solely through the PACE program.  Scope of Medicaid Services Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows considerable flexibility within the states' Medicaid plans. However, some federal requirements are mandatory if federal matching funds are to be received. A state's Medicaid program must offer medical assistance for certain basic services to most categorically needy populations. These services generally include the following: 0                  Inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services. Prenatal care. Vaccines for children. Physician services. Nursing facility services for persons aged 21 or older. Family planning services and supplies. Rural health clinic services. Home health care for persons eligible for skillednursing services. Laboratory and x-ray services. Pediatric and family nurse practitioner services. Nurse-midwife services. Federally qualified health-center (FQHC) services, and ambulatory services of an FQHC that would be available in other settings. Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services for children under age 21.  Amount and Duration of Services Within broad federal guidelines and certain limitations, states determine the amount and duration of services offered under their Medicaid programs. States may limit, for example, the number of days of hospital care or the number of physician visits covered. Two restrictions apply: (1) limits must result in a sufficient level of services to reasonably achieve the purpose of the benefits; and (2) limits on benefits may not discriminate among beneficiaries based on medical diagnosis or condition. In general, states are required to provide comparable amounts, duration, and scope of services to all categorically needy and categorically related eligible persons. There are two important exceptions: (1) Medically necessary health care services that are identified under the EPSDT program for eligible children, and that are within the scope of mandatory or optional services under federal law, must be covered even if those services are not included as part of the covered services in that state's plan; and (2) states may request ""waivers"" to pay for otherwise uncovered home and community-based services (HCBS) for Medicaid-eligible persons who might otherwise be institutionalized. As long as the services are cost effective, states have few limitations on the services that may be covered under these waivers (except that, other than as a part of respite care, states may not provide room and board for the recipients). With certain exceptions, a state's Medicaid program must allow recipients to have some informed choices among participating providers of health care and to receive quality care that is appropriate and timely.  States may also receive federal matching funds to provide certain optional services. Following are the most common of the 34 currently approved optional Medicaid services: 0   Diagnostic services.  Clinic services.  Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR).  Prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices.  Optometrist services and eyeglasses.  Nursing facility services for children under age 21.  Transportation services.  Rehabilitation and physical therapy services.  Home and community-based care to certain persons with chronic impairments. The BBA included a state option known as programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE). PACE provides an alternative to institutional care for persons aged 55 or older who require a nursing facility level of care. The PACE team  Payment for Services Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program. States may pay health care providers directly on a fee-forservice basis, or states may pay for Medicaid services through various prepayment arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Within federally imposed upper limits and specific restrictions, each state for the most part has broad discretion in determining the payment methodology and payment rate for services. Gen-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  59   Medicaid erally, payment rates must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered services are available at least to the extent that comparable care and services are available to the general population within that geographic area. Providers participating in Medicaid must accept Medicaid payment rates as payment in full. States must make additional payments to qualified hospitals that provide inpatient services to a disproportionate number of Medicaid recipients and/or to other low-income or uninsured persons under what is known as the ""disproportionate share hospital"" (DSH) adjustment. During 19881991, excessive and inappropriate use of the DSH adjustment resulted in rapidly increasing federal expenditures for Medicaid. However, under legislation passed in 1991, 1993, and again within the BBA of 1997, the federal share of payments to disproportionate share hospitals has become increasingly limited. States may impose nominal deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments on some Medicaid recipients for certain services. The following Medicaid recipients, however, must be excluded from cost sharing: pregnant women, children under age 18, and hospital or nursing home patients who are expected to contribute most of their income to institutional care. In addition, all Medicaid recipients must be exempt from copayments for emergency services and family planning services. The federal government pays a share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program. That share, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), is determined annually by a formula that compares the state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent or higher than 83 percent. In 2001, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent in 10 states to 76.82 percent in Mississippi, and averaged 57 percent overall. The BBA also permanently raised the FMAP for the District of Columbia from 50 percent to 70 percent and raised the FMAP for Alaska from 50 percent to 59.8 percent through 2000. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) further adjusted Alaska's FMAP to a higher level for 20012005. For the children added to Medicaid through the SCHIP program, the FMAP average for all states is about 70 percent, compared to the general Medicaid average of 57 percent. The federal government also reimburses states for 100 percent of the cost of services provided through facilities of the Indian Health Service, provides financial help to the 12 states that furnish the highest number of emergency services to undocumented aliens, and shares in each state's expenditures for the administration of the Medicaid program. Most administrative costs are matched at 50 percent, although higher percentages are paid for certain activities and functions, such as development of mechanized claims processing systems. Except for the SCHIP program, the Qualifying Individuals (QI) program (described later), and DSH payments, federal payments to states for medical assistance have no set limit (cap). Rather, the federal government matches (at FMAP rates) state expenditures for the mandatory services, as well as for the optional services that the individual state decides to cover for eligible recipients, and matches (at the appropriate administrative rate) all necessary and proper administrative costs. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (as incorporated into Public Law 106-113, the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000) increased the amount that certain states and the territories can spend on DSH and SCHIP payments, respectively. The BIPA set upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities.  Summary and Trends Medicaid was initially formulated as a medical care extension of federally funded programs providing cash income assistance for the poor, with an emphasis on dependent children and their mothers, the disabled, and the elderly. Over the years, however, Medicaid eligibility has been incrementally expanded beyond its original ties with eligibility for cash programs. Legislation in the late 1980s assured Medicaid coverage to an expanded number of low-income pregnant women, poor children, and to some Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for any cash assistance program. Legislative changes also focused on increased access, better quality of care, specific benefits, enhanced outreach programs, and fewer limits on services. In most years since its inception, Medicaid has had very rapid growth in expenditures, although the rate of increase has subsided somewhat recently. This rapid growth in Medicaid expenditures has been due primarily to the following factors: 0   The increase in size of the Medicaid-covered populations as a result of federal mandates, population growth, and the earlier economic recession. In recent years Medicaid enrollment has declined somewhat.  The expanded coverage and utilization of services.  The DSH payment program, coupled with its inappropriate use to increase federal payments to states.  The increase in the number of very old and disabled persons requiring extensive acute and/or long-term health care and various related services.  The results of technological advances to keep a greater number of very low-birth-weight babies and other critically ill or severely injured persons alive and in need of continued extensive and very costly care.  The increase in payment rates to providers of health care services, when compared to general inflation.  60  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicaid As with all health insurance programs, most Medicaid recipients require relatively small average expenditures per person each year, and a relatively small proportion incurs very large costs. Moreover, the average cost varies substantially by type of beneficiary. The data for 1998, for example, indicate that Medicaid payments for services for 20.6 million children, who constitute 51 percent of all Medicaid recipients, average about $1,150 per child (a relatively small average expenditure per person). Similarly, for 8.6 million adults, who comprise 21 percent of recipients, payments average about $1,775 per person. However, certain other specific groups have much larger per-person expenditures. Medicaid payments for services for 4 million aged, constituting 11 percent of all Medicaid recipients, average about $9,700 per person; for 7.2 million disabled, who comprise 18 percent of recipients, payments average about $8,600 per person. When expenditures for these high- and lower-cost recipients are combined, the 1998 payments to health care vendors for 40.6 million Medicaid recipients average $3,500 per person. Long-term care is an important provision of Medicaid that will be increasingly utilized as our nation's population ages. The Medicaid program has paid for almost 45 percent of the total cost of care for persons using nursing facility or home health services in recent years. However, for those persons who use more than 4 months of this longterm care, Medicaid pays for a much larger percentage. The data for 1998 show that Medicaid payments for nursing facility services (excluding ICFs/MR) and home health care totaled $41.3 billion for more than 3.3 million recipients of these services--an average 1998 expenditure of $12,375 per long-term care recipient. With the percentage of our population who are elderly or disabled increasing faster than that of the younger groups, the need for long-term care is expected to increase. Another significant development in Medicaid is the growth in managed care as an alternative service delivery concept different from the traditional fee-for-service system. Under managed care systems, HMOs, prepaid health plans, or comparable entities agree to provide a specific set of services to Medicaid enrollees, usually in return for a predetermined periodic payment per enrollee. Managed care programs seek to enhance access to quality care in a cost-effective manner. Waivers may provide the states with greater flexibility in the design and implementation of their Medicaid managed care programs. Waiver authority under sections 1915(b) and 1115 of the Social Security Act is an important part of the Medicaid program. Section 1915(b) waivers allow states to develop innovative health care delivery or reimbursement systems. Section 1115 waivers allow statewide health care reform experimental demonstrations to cover uninsured populations and to test new delivery systems without increasing costs. Finally, the BBA provided states a new option to use managed care. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in some form of managed care program is growing rapidly, from 14 percent of enrollees in 1993 to 54 percent in 1998. Medicaid data as reported by the states indicate that more than 41.0 million persons received health care services through the Medicaid program in 1999 (the last year for which recipient data are available). Total outlays for the Medicaid program in 2000 included direct payment to providers of $146.4 billion, payments for various premiums (for HMOs, Medicare, etc.) of $33.9 billion, payments to the disproportionate share hospitals of $14.4 billion, and administrative costs of $10.6 billion. The total expenditure for the nation's Medicaid program in 2000, excluding administrative costs, was $194.7 billion ($111.1 billion in federal and $83.6 billion in state funds). With anticipated impacts from the BBA, projections now are that total Medicaid outlays may be $334.9 billion in fiscal year 2006, with an additional $4.3 billion expected to be spent for the new SCHIP.  Medicaid-Medicare Relationship Medicare beneficiaries who have low incomes and limited resources may also receive help from the Medicaid program. For such persons who are eligible for full Medicaid coverage, the Medicare health care coverage is supplemented by services that are available under their state's Medicaid program, according to eligibility category. These additional services may include, for example, nursing facility care beyond the 100-day limit covered by Medicare, prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. For persons enrolled in both programs, any services that are covered by Medicare are paid for by the Medicare program before any payments are made by the Medicaid program, since Medicaid is always the ""payer of last resort."" Certain other Medicare beneficiaries may receive help with Medicare premium and cost-sharing payments through their state Medicaid program. Qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs) and specified low-Income Medicare beneficiaries (SLMBs) are the best-known categories and the largest in numbers. QMBs are those Medicare beneficiaries who have resources at or below twice the standard allowed under the SSI program, and incomes at or below 100 percent of the FPL. For QMBs, Medicaid pays the Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums and the Medicare coinsurance and deductibles, subject to limits that states may impose on payment rates. SLMBs are Medicare beneficiaries with resources like the QMBs, but with incomes that are higher, though still less than 120 percent of the FPL. For SLMBs, the Medicaid program pays only the SMI premiums. A third category of Medicare beneficiaries who may receive help consists of disabled-and-working individuals. According to the Medicare law, disabled-and-working individuals who previously qualified for Medicare because of disability, but who lost entitlement because of their return to work (despite the disability), are allowed to purchase Medicare  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  61   Medicaid HI and SMI coverage. If these persons have incomes below 200 percent of the FPL but do not meet any other Medicaid assistance category, they may qualify to have Medicaid pay their HI premiums as qualified disabled and working individuals (QDWIs). According to CMS estimates, Medicaid currently provides some level of supplemental health coverage for 5 million Medicare beneficiaries within the above three categories. For Medicare beneficiaries with incomes that are above 120 percent and less than 175 percent of the FPL, the BBA establishes a capped allocation to states, for each of the 5 years beginning January 1998, for payment of all or some of the Medicare SMI premiums. These beneficiaries are known as qualifying individuals (QIs). Unlike QMBs and SLMBs, who may be eligible for other Medicaid benefits in addition to their QMB/SLMB benefits, the QIs cannot be otherwise eligible for medical assistance under a state plan. The payment of this QI benefit is 100 percent federally funded, up to the state's allocation. 0  Note: Medicaid data are based on the projections of the Midsession Review of the President's Fiscal Year 2002 Budget and are consistent with data received from the states on the Forms HCFA-2082, HCFA-37, and HCFA-64.

Workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are covered under unemployment insurance programs. To induce states to enact unemployment insurance laws, the Social Security Act of 1935 provided a tax offset incentive. A uniform national tax was imposed on payrolls of industrial and commercial employers who employed eight or more workers in 20 or more weeks in a calendar year. Employers who paid taxes to a state with an approved unemployment insurance law could credit (offset) up to 90 percent of the state tax against the federal tax. This insured that employers in states without an unemployment insurance law would not have an advantage competing with similar businesses in states with such a law because they would still be subject to the federal payroll tax, and their employees would not be eligible for benefits. In addition, the Social Security Act authorized grants to states to meet the costs of administering the state systems. By July 1937, all 48 states, the then territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia had passed unemployment insurance laws. Later, Puerto Rico adopted its own unemployment insurance program, which was incorporated in 1961 into the federal-state system. A similar program for workers in the Virgin Islands was added in 1978. If employers are to receive an offset against federal taxes and if states are to receive federal grants for administration, federal law requires state unemployment insurance programs to meet certain requirements. These requirements are intended to assure that a state participating in the program has an unemployment insurance system that is fairly administered and financially secure. One requirement is that all contributions collected under state laws be deposited in the unemployment trust fund of the U.S. Treasury Department. The fund is invested as a whole, but each state has a separate account to which its deposits and its share of interest on investments are credited. At any time, a state may withdraw money from its account in the trust fund, but only to pay benefits. Thus, unlike the situation in the majority of states having workers' compensation and temporary disability insurance laws, unemployment insurance benefits are paid exclusively through a public fund. Private plans cannot be substituted for the state plan. Aside from federal standards, each state has major responsibility for the content and development of its unemployment insurance law. The state itself decides the amount and duration of benefits (except for certain federal requirements concerning Federal-State Extended Benefits), the contribution rates (with limitations), and, in general, the eligibility requirements and disqualification provisions. The states also directly administer the programs-collecting contributions, maintaining wage records (where applicable), taking claims, determining eligibility, and paying benefits to unemployed workers.  Coverage Originally, coverage had been limited to employment covered by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which relates primarily to industrial and commercial workers in private industry. However, several federal laws added substantially to the number and types of workers protected under the state programs, such as the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 and the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976. Private employers in industry and commerce are subject to the law if they have one or more individuals employed on 1 day in each of 20 weeks during the current or preceding year, or if they paid wages of $1,500 or more during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding year. Agricultural workers are covered on farms with a quarterly payroll of at least $20,000 or employing 10 or more employees in 20 weeks of the year. Domestic employees in private households are subject to FUTA if their employer pays wages of $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter. Excluded from coverage are workers employed by their families and the self-employed. Before 1976, employment in state and local governments and nonprofit organizations were exempt from FUTA. However, as a result of federal legislation enacted in 1976, most employment in these groups must now be covered by state law as a condition for securing federal approval of the state law. Under this form of coverage, local government and nonprofit employers have the option of making contributions as under FUTA or of reimbursing the state for benefit expenditures actually made. Elected officials, legislators, members of the judiciary, and the state National Guard are still excluded, as are employees of nonprofit organizations that employ fewer than four workers in 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Many states have extended coverage beyond that provided by federal legislation. Through special federal legislation, federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers of the Armed Forces were brought under the unemployment insurance system. Benefits for these persons are financed through federal funds but are administered by the states and paid in accordance with the provisions of the state laws. A separate unemployment insurance law enacted by Congress covers railroad workers.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  63   Unemployment Insurance  Eligibility for Benefits Unemployment benefits are available as a matter of right (without a means test) to unemployed workers who have demonstrated their attachment to the labor force by a specified amount of recent work and/or earnings in covered employment. All workers whose employers contribute to or make payments in lieu of contributions to state unemployment funds, federal civilian employees, and ex-servicemembers are eligible if they are involuntarily unemployed, able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. Workers must also meet the eligibility and qualifying requirements of the state law and be free from disqualifications. Workers who meet these eligibility conditions may still be denied benefits if they are found to be responsible for their own unemployment.  relatives. The amount allowed per dependent varies considerably by state but generally is $24 or less per week and, in the majority of states, the amount is the same for each dependent. All but 7 states require a waiting period of 1 week of total unemployment before benefits can begin. Three states pay benefits retroactively for the waiting period if unemployment lasts a certain period or if the employee returns to work within a specified period. Except for two jurisdictions, states provide a statutory maximum duration of 26 weeks of benefits in a benefit year. However, jurisdictions vary the duration of benefits through various formulas.  Extended Benefits In the 1970s, a permanent federal-state program of Extended Benefits (EB) was established for workers who exhaust their entitlement to regular state benefits during periods of high unemployment. The program is financed equally from federal and state funds. Employment conditions in an individual state trigger Extended Benefits. This happens when the unemployment rate among insured workers in a state averages 5 percent or more over a 13week period, and is at least 20 percent higher than the rate for the same period in the 2 preceding years. If the insured unemployment rate reaches 6 percent, a state may by state law disregard the 20-percent requirement in initiating Extended Benefits. Once triggered, Extended Benefit provisions remain in effect for at least 13 weeks. When a state's benefit period ends, Extended Benefits to individual workers also end, even if they have received less than their potential entitlement and are still unemployed. Further, once a state's benefit period ends, another statewide period cannot begin for at least 13 weeks. State law determines most eligibility conditions for Extended Benefits and the weekly benefit payable. However, under federal law a claimant applying for Extended Benefits must have had 20 weeks in full-time employment (or the equivalent in insured wages) and must meet special work requirements. A worker who has exhausted his or her regular benefits is eligible for a 50-percent increase in duration of benefits for a maximum of 13 weeks of Extended Benefits. There is, however, an overall maximum of 39 weeks of regular and Extended Benefits. Extended Benefits are payable at the same rate as the weekly amount under the regular state program. Prior to the 1992 legislation, the EB program was based on the insured unemployment rate (IUR)the number of unemployed workers receiving benefits in a state as a percent of the number of persons in unemployment-insurance covered employment in that state. By definition, the IUR does not include workers who have exhausted their benefits but are still unemployed. The 1992 legislation (P.L. 102-318) provided states the option of adopting an additional formula for triggering the  Work Requirements A worker's monetary benefit rights are based on his or her employment in covered work over a prior reference period called the ""base period,"" and these benefit rights remain fixed for a ""benefit year."" In most states, the base period is the first 4 quarters of the last 5 completed calendar quarters preceding the claim for unemployment benefits.  Benefits Under all state laws, the weekly benefit amount-that is, the amount payable for a week of total unemployment-varies with the worker's past wages within certain minimum and maximum limits. In most states, the formula is designed to compensate for a fraction of the usual weekly wage, normally about 50 percent, subject to specified dollar maximums. Three-fourths of the laws use a formula that computes weekly benefits as a fraction of wages in one or more quarters of the base period. Most commonly, the fraction is taken of wages in the quarter during which wages were highest because this quarter most nearly reflects full-time work. In most of these states, the same fraction is used at all benefit levels. The other laws use a weighted schedule that gives a greater proportion of the high-quarter wages to lower paid workers than to those earning more. Each state establishes a ceiling on the weekly benefit amount and no worker may receive an amount larger than the ceiling. The maximum may be either a fixed dollar amount or a flexible amount. Under the latter arrangement, which has been adopted in 35 jurisdictions, the maximum is adjusted automatically in accordance with the weekly wages of covered employees. Twelve states provide additional allowances for certain dependents. They all include children under ages 16, 18, or 19 (and, generally, older if incapacitated); 8 states include a nonworking spouse; and 2 states consider other dependent  64  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Unemployment Insurance permanent Extended Benefits program. Effective March 1993, states had the option of amending their laws to use alternative total unemployment rate triggers in addition to the current insured unemployment rate triggers. Under this option, Extended Benefits would be paid when: (1) the state's seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate for the most recent 3 months is at least 6.5 percent, and (2) that rate is at least 110 percent of the state average total unemployment rate in the corresponding 3-month period in either of the 2 preceding years. States triggering on to the Extended Benefits program under other triggers would provide the regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in addition to 13 weeks of Extended Benefits, (which is the same number of weeks of benefits provided previously). In addition, states that have chosen the total unemployment rate option will also amend their state laws to add an additional 7 weeks of Extended Benefits (for a total of 20 weeks) where the total unemployment rate is at least 8 percent and is 110 percent of the state's total unemployment rate for the same 3 months in either of the 2 preceding years. As of March 4, 2001, Extended Benefits were payable for 13 weeks in Alaska based on the insured unemployment rate.  CONTACT: Rita L. DiSimone (202) 358-6221 for further information.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  65   Workers' Compensation  Workers' Compensation Workers' compensation provides cash benefits and medical care when employees suffer work-related injuries or illnesses, and survivor benefits to the dependents of workers whose deaths result from a work-related incident. In exchange for receiving benefits, workers who receive workers' compensation are generally not allowed to bring a tort suit against their employers for damages of any kind. Workers' compensation was the first form of social insurance to develop widely in the United States. The federal government was the first to establish a workers' compensation program, covering its civilian employees with an act that was passed in 1908 to provide benefits for workers engaged in hazardous work. The remaining federal workforce was covered in 1916. Nine states enacted workers' compensation laws in 1911. By 1920, all but 7 states and the District of Columbia had workers' compensation laws. Today each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands has its own program. The federal government covers its employees through its own program, and it also administers the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, enacted in 1927, which covers longshore and harbor workers throughout the United States. Coal miners suffering from pneumoconiosis, or ""black lung"" disease, are covered by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, with the initial benefits enacted as part of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Under this program, monthly cash benefits are payable to miners disabled by black lung disease and to their dependents or survivors. Medical benefits are also payable on the basis of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 instituted a new program that covers employees, contractors, and sub-contractors of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for exposure to beryllium and the contraction of chronic beryllium disease. In addition, employees of private companies providing beryllium to DOE are covered. Employees' survivors also receive cash benefits. This same act also covers employees disabled or killed by cancers that developed after beginning employment at a DOE or an atomic weapons facility, as long as the cancer was at least ""as likely as not"" related to this employment, subject to a number of guidelines relating to radiation exposure, type of cancer, and other relevant factors. It also provides benefits for silica-related diseases and to uranium miners and their survivors who have received lump sum payments under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and establishes an Office of Worker Advocacy in the DOE to deal with other claims of work-related occupational disease.  Coverage In 1999, state and federal workers' compensation laws covered about 123.9 million employees. Covered payroll in 1999--that is, total wages paid to covered workers--was $4.1 trillion. Common exemptions from coverage are domestic service, agricultural employment, small employers, and casual labor. However, 39 programs have some coverage for agricultural workers, and 25 programs have some coverage for domestic workers. Many programs exempt employees of nonprofit, charitable, or religious institutions. The coverage of state and local public employees differs widely from one state program to another. Two other major groups outside the coverage of workers' compensation laws are railroad employees engaged in interstate commerce and seamen in the U.S. Merchant Marine. These workers have health insurance and shortterm and long-term cash benefit plans that cover disabilities whether or not the conditions are work-related. In addition, under federal laws these workers retain the right to bring tort suits against their employers for negligence in the case of work-related injuries or illness. The programs are compulsory for most private employment, except in Texas, where it is elective. That is, in Texas employers may accept or reject coverage under the law. If they reject it, they lose the customary common-law defenses against suits by employees in private industry.  Benefits The benefits provided under workers' compensation include periodic cash payments and medical services to the worker during the period of disablement for the disabling condition. They also include death and funeral benefits to the workers' survivors. Lump-sum settlements are permitted under most programs. Approximately three-fourths of all worker's compensation cases involve only medical benefits. Cash wage replacement benefits are categorized according to the duration and severity of the worker's disability. Temporary and Permanent Total Disability A large majority of compensation cases involving cash payments involve temporary total disability. That is, the employee is unable to work at all while he or she is recovering from the injury but the worker is expected to recover. When workers' lost time exceeds the waiting period (3 to 7 days, depending on the state) they receive a percentage of their weekly wages--typically two-thirds--up to a maximum weekly amount. The maximum generally is set at some percentage of the state's average weekly wage, ranging from 66-2/3 percent to 200 percent, but typically 100 percent.  66  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Workers' Compensation In some cases, workers return to work prior to the date they reach maximum medical improvement and thus have reduced responsibilities and an accompanying lower salary. In those cases, they receive temporary partial disability benefits. After the date of maximum medical improvement, if a disability is severe enough, the worker receives permanent total disability benefits. Very few workers compensation cases are found to have permanent total disabilities. Permanent Partial Disability If the permanent disability of a worker is only partial and may or may not lessen work ability, permanent partial disability benefits are payable. The system for determining benefits in these cases is very complex and varies significantly across jurisdictions. Some states provide benefits based on an impairment rating process. The level of impairment, often expressed as a percent of total disability, is used to determine the benefit amount. Some states provide benefits based on the loss of earning capacity. They use impairment ratings with modifications based on vocational factors, such as the worker's education, job experience, and age. Other states use systems that attempt to compensate workers for actual lost wages. Death Benefits Generally, compensation is related to earnings and to the number of dependents payable to the survivors of workers who die from a work related illness or injury. Benefits are capped in 26 states. Medical Benefits All compensation acts require that medical aid be furnished to workers suffering from a work-related injury or illness witho"
GX267-73-12596959	"Department of Consumer & Business Services  Oregon Insurance  Insurance Division  REGUL ATOR Fall 2003  Lawmakers address varied insurance issues during 2003 legislative session he Oregon Legislature passed a number of bills relating to insurance during its 2003 session. Lawmakers addressed a variety of issues, including credit scoring, privacy of personal health information, rating and underwriting of health insurance, regulation of insurance transactions by depository institutions, professional liability and tort reform, and environmental cleanup.  Rural doctors to get break on insurance Most rural physicians in Oregon will pay less for medical professional liability insurance, thanks to a bill approved in the 2003 session. Governor Ted Kulongoski proposed HB 3630 to give immediate rate relief to rural doctors while a long-term solution is considered for a market-wide problem. Under the bill, the State Accident Insurance Fund Corp. will reimburse insurers for part of the cost of coverage for qualifying physicians for calendar years 2004-2007. In exchange, SAIF will get to claim a credit against its Oregon workers' compensation premium assessment. Rural obstetricians will see up to an 80 percent reduction in premiums. Family or general pr actice doctors who provide obstetrical services will get up to a 60 percent reduction, and other rural physicians can qualify for up to a 40 percent reduction. Please see DOCTORS, Page 7  T  Insurance-related legislation approved in the 2003 session is summarized in this issue of the Oregon Insurance Regulator. These summaries are not intended to be a complete and detailed statement of all insurance-rated laws passed by the 2003 Legislature. For more information, including links to approved bills, visit the Please see LEGISLATURE, Page 5  Legislature restricts use of credit scoring The 2003 Ore g on Le gislature approved a ban on using a policyholder's credit information to raise premiums. Senate Bill 260 also prohibits insurers from canceling or refusing to renew existing policies because of credit history. SB 260 will allow insurers to continue using credit information when deciding whether to issue a new policy, but only if they can document that it helps them predict future claim costs and price their products fairly for consumers. At the same time, insurance companies must demonstrate that credit information is used as part of an evaluation system that also relies on other actuarially-relevant factors. The bill also requires insurers using credit history to file their scoring models with the Department of Consumer & Business Services. The bill augments an Insurance Division administrative rule that prohibited insurers from canceling or refusing to renew existing policies because of credit history problems. SB 260 is effective for policies renewed January 1, 2004, or later.  New premium surcharge may generate consumer questions Insurers and agents may get questions from consumers who notice a new premium surcharge on their property and casualty insurance policies next year. HB 3051, passed in the 2003 legislative session, changes the way insurers recoup assessments paid to the Oregon Insurance Guarantee Association (OIGA). Authorized property and casualty insurers in Oregon are required to participate in the OIGA, which settles unpaid claims when an insurer becomes insolvent. OIGA then assesses other member insurers to cover claim costs. Current law allows insurers to claim tax credits to offset the assessment, thus reducing state revenues. Under HB 3051, insurers will instead recoup any OIGA assessment by surcharging each policyholder. HB 3051 applies to assessments imposed on or after Jan. 1, 2003, and to earlier assessments that haven't been fully recouped. Insurers can start recouping assessments beginning Jan. 1 of the year after the assessment was imposed, so the surcharge will begin showing up in January 2004. The amount of the surcharge will be listed on the policy premium statement or declaration page. The surcharge is estimated to be less than 1 percent of policy premiums in 2004. Policies will be assessed as needed by the OIGA, so the surcharge may not appear at each renewal cycle. For more information, visit the Insurance Division's Web site: oregoninsurance.org. Click on What's New.   Page 2  Oregon Insurance Regulator  Fall 2003  A G E NT L I C E N S I N G  Legislators approve several changes to licensing laws By Margarita Nuez The following changes will take effect Jan. 1, 2004, as a result of passage of Senate Bill 253 by the Oregon Legislature:  Commissions and service fees -- An insurer or insurance producer will be allowed to charge a commission, a service fee, or a combination of the two when transacting insurance except for the following: 1. Insurance covering an individual's person, property, or liability 2. Life or health insurance for groups of fewer than 51 lives 3. Insurance on a commercial or public entity paying combined annual premiums of less than $100,000 for insurance A written agreement with the consumer is required prior to binding or issuing an insurance policy.  License reinstatement period -- The license reinstatement period will be shortened from two years to one year, so if you let your license expire for more than one year, you'll have to reapply for a license. This change brings Oregon into conformance with national licensing standards. We will change all licenses expired for more than one year to an ""expired nonrenewable"" status.  Notice of appointments -- Insurers will no longer be required to file notices of appointments with the Insurance Division. Instead, insurers will need to maintain a current list of contracted insurance producers and make it available to the division upon request. All active appointments in the Agent Licensing database will be terminated as of Jan. 1, 2004. Affiliation notices of agents to agencies will still be required.  Good-bye agents, hello producers -- The term ""producer"" will replace ""agent"" throughout the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). All of our forms will be revised to indicate this change. New licenses using the term ""producer"" will be issued for active agents at renewal. Licensing exam update Promissor, our new vendor, has been administering Oregon licensing exams since July. Candidates for licenses now need to pay their exam fees directly to Promissor instead of the Insurance Division as they did in the past. We will refund any exam fees we receive from candidates who mistakenly send them to us. Promissor operates permanent testing sites in Tigard; Kennewick and Vancouver, Washington; and Boise, Idaho. Exams also can be taken at temporary sites in Eugene and Medford. Promissor plans to open permanent sites in Eugene Dec. 5 and in Medford Dec. 13. Exam site addresses, directions, hours, and other information are available on the Insurance Division's Web site, oregoninsurance.org. Click on Agent Information, then Application process for all license categories. Law and ethics requirements Agents are reminded that they must take three hours of law and two hours of ethics before every renewal. The only agents exempt from this continuing-education requirement are those who hold a limited lines license or have been granted a continuing-education exemption. New continuing education course topic Some new continuing education courses are being approved under the agency management topic. This topic includes subject matter on office management, client relations, and improving the operations of an agent's business. Agents can count up to four hours of agency management courses toward their continuing education requirement. These courses can be identified by looking at the course registration number assigned to the course. All course registration numbers for agency management will start with a ""P,"" followed by the number of hours that have been approved for the agency management course or section.  Margarita Nuez is manager of the Agent Licensing Unit.  Insurers, agents flunk Medigap test How accurate is the Medigap information Oregon consumers receive from insurance companies and agents? Not very, according to a ""secret shopper"" survey conducted by staff from the Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance (SHIBA) program. Tw enty-eight insurers that sell Medigap plans in Oregon were asked about four common situations involving federal and/or state guaranteed-issue rights for Medicare beneficiaries losing their health insurance. Some companies responded directly and some referred questions to an agent. Companies and agents correctly responded to the survey questions less than a third of the time on average. On one  question regarding Oregon Medigap protections, only 15.4 percent of respondents got the right answer. If you'd like to test your Medigap knowledge, visit the Insurance Division's Web site, oregoninsurance.org. Click on Agent Licensing. SHIBA held a Medigap workshop in November and plans to send training materials to companies selling Medigap plans.

Insurance-related legislation is summarized in this issue of the Oregon Insurance Regulator and on our Web site (oregoninsurance.org), but I wanted to highlight several key measures:  Credit scoring. Passage of Senate Bill 260 gives us significantly improved tools to regulate credit scoring. The legislation, which augments our administrative rules, generally bans use of credit history in rating and underwriting for renewal business. Insurers can still use credit for new business, subject to certain restrictions.  Insurance Division bills. Lawmakers passed several bills we sponsored. SB 235 establishes important consumer safeguards banks must follow when selling insurance. SB 253 allows producers to represent either insurers or insureds, and to charge fees when transacting certain types of commercial insurance.  Medical professionals and contractors. Legislators took action to help two markets in desperate need of good news: liability insurance for medical professionals and contractors. HB 3630 provides a financial mechanism administered by SAIF that will enable insurers to offer reduced rates to rural doctors. Contractors and insurers may see some relief through passage of SB 909, which requires  O  a homeowner to follow certain procedures to remedy problems with a contractor before suing, and SB 943, which allows contractors to pursue insurance alternatives such as self insurance. Governor praises electronic complaint filing Oregon's executive and legislative branches have made regulatory streamlining and improved customer service top priorities during the next two years. I was pleased that Governor Ted Kulongoski recognized the division for making it easy for consumers to file complaints online. Division begins reorganization process A reorganization of the Insurance Division is underway. Jann Goodpaster will manage our new Market Regulation Section, which will allow us to better integrate rates and forms with other compliance functions, including market analysis, market conduct, and investigations. Senior policy advisor joins division I'm pleased to welcome Shelley Bain to our executive team as a senior policy advisor. Her legal background will be invaluable as she analyzes the many complex issues facing insurance regulators today. Shelley joins Michael Morter, who focuses on legislative and stakeholder relations, and Lewis Littlehales, our longtime legislation and administrative rules coordinator.

Unless otherwise specified, the effective date of a bill is Jan. 1, 2004. A bill may also have one or more operative dates that apply to one or more sections, in addition to its effective date. An operative date is the date on which the affected section or sections first apply. Bills passed in 2003 are listed by their bill numbers, and, if known, their Oregon Laws chapter numbers. SB indicates a Senate bill, while HB indicates a House bill. DCBS is the Department of Consumer & Business Services. Insurance regulation generally  The bill makes similar changes relating to compensation for transactions between a wholesale insurance producer and a retail insurance producer, and between a surplus lines licensee and an insurance customer or a producing agent. This bill does not require insurers to amend their contracts, policy forms, and other documents to conform them to the change to ""insurance producer."" HB 2278 -- Insurance regulation HB 2278 mak es miscellaneous changes to the implementation and enforcement of insurance laws by DCBS, although the bulk of the bill deals with non-insurance issues. Changes in the insurance portion of HB 2278 include:  Making health-care service contractors subject to the same regulatory review to which insurers are subject to for transactions involving insurers within an insurance holding company system and for extraordinary dividends by insurers.  Allowing the DCBS director to delegate the title of insurance commissioner.  Repealing the DCBS director's authority to exempt from the Insurance Code entities that transact certain limited types of insurance, but allowing existing exemptions to continue. HB 3145 -- Home service agreements (ch 283) HB 3145 ex cludes ""home service ag reements"" from the definition of ""home protection insurance"" in the Insurance Code. A home service agreement is defined as a contract for a specific and limited duration to service, repair, or replace the mechanical or appliance system of an existing home, or provide incidental service, repair, or replacement to cover leaks and failures in roofing systems. Life and health insurance  The bill provides that the minimum nonforfeiture amount equals the then accumulated value, according to a formula using a minimum interest rate of 3 percent or a calculation based on five-year Treasury notes, whichever is less, but not less than 1 percent. The bill also allows the DCBS director to adopt rules for equity-indexed products. HB 2306 -- Privacy of health insurance information (ch 87) HB 2306 gives the DCBS director rulemaking authority to reconcile state and federal privacy requirements relating to personal records in the hands of health insurers and other licensees transacting health insurance. Effective date: May 24, 2003. HB 2987 -- Individual and smallgroup health insurance market changes (ch 599) HB 2987 authorizes health insurance carriers in the individual market to impose waivers of coverage on pre-existing conditions for up to 24 months. Under current law, exclusions for pre-existing conditions are limited to six months. The bill allows individuals who are offered the longer waiver periods to be eligible for coverage under the Oregon Medical Insurance Pool. The bill also authorizes small-group market carriers to charge the highestrated group up to 2.5 times as much as they charge the lowest-rated group. Under current law, carriers may charge the highest-rated group up to twice as much. The bill authorizes carriers in the small group market to give groups a 5 percent credit if all eligible employees enroll for coverage. Current law does not provide for such credits. HB 2987 authorizes the DCBS director to obtain data from carriers to assess the bill's effect on the marketplace. HB 3431 -- Individual health insurance market changes (ch 590) HB 3431 authorizes a health insurance carrier offering individual health benefit plans to limit the choice of plans in which an individual may enroll. Under current law, if a carrier accepts an individual for a specific plan, the individual can choose among all of the plans offered by the carrier. Please see LEGISLATURE, Page 7  SB 235 -- Transaction of insurance by depository institutions (ch 363) SB 235 conforms existing state regulation of insurance trade practices by depository institutions to guidelines and limitations of the federal Gramm-LeachBliley Act, furthering the federal law's purpose of integrating banking, insurance and securities services. Federal law allows depository institutions to transact insurance but also authorizes a state to impose specific consumer protections governing them when they transact insurance. Regulation of insurance activities by depository institutions is retained in the Insurance Code. SB 253 -- Insurance producers (ch 364) SB 253 further facilitates interstate licensing of insurance agents and otherwise updates Oregon's laws governing their compensation. The bill eliminates the ""agent"" terminology and replaces it with ""insurance producer"" and authorizes an insurance producer to represent an insurer or the purchaser of insurance. The bill also allows an insurance producer to charge a full or reduced commission, a service fee or a combination of the two when transacting commercial insurance. In order to charge a fee, an insurance producer must have a written agreement with the prospective insured that meets conditions established by the DCBS director by rule.  SB 734 -- Individual deferred annuities, nonforfeiture (ch 370) SB 734 amends provisions of the Insurance Code governing nonforfeiture of deferred annuities that ensure a surrender value when the policyholder decides to discontinue further payments. Current law provides that the minimum nonforfeiture amount equals the then accumulated value, according to a formula, at 3 percent interest.   Page 6  Oregon Insurance Regulator  Fall 2003  P R O D U C E R A CT I O N S Actions against insurance producers are summarized below.

If you need to lose a significant amount of weight, consult your doctor          as to what may be the most effective means.         Strategies          may include exercise, nutritional guidance or treatment by prescription.          For those with a prolonged history of obesity, gastric bypass surgery          may be an option.         Gastric          bypass – sometimes called bariatric surgery — can be risky.          During the surgery, a small pouch about an ounce in capacity is created          by stapling off a large section of the stomach. A portion of the small          intestine is then re-routed and connected to the pouch.          This          greatly reduces the amount of food that can be ingested, resulting in          nearly instant weight loss. Here are some pros and cons:                                 Risks                                        Ten              to 20 percent of patients require some sort of follow-up procedure              because of complications.                                                              Some              patients develop gallstones. The risk for gallstones increases during              substantial weight loss.                                                              Approximately              30 percent of patients develop nutritional deficiencies.                                      Benefits                                        Surgery              can improve obesity-related conditions such as diabetes and high blood              pressure.                                                              Most              patients lose weight quickly and continue to lose it for up to 24              months.                                                                Many              patients can maintain a loss of 100 pounds in the long-term.                           Not          all health plans cover this procedure, and those that do have strict guidelines          that must be met.          Check          with your health plan to see if gastric bypass is a covered benefit and          what is required.         If          gastric bypass surgery isn’t for you, talk to your physician about          other alternatives to weight control.

Exempt          employees with at least one year of service have state-paid life insurance          coverage in the amount of their annual salary. The insurance plan is administered          by Medical Life Insurance Company.          Until          now the only option for exempt employees upon leaving state service was          to convert the state-paid basic life policy to an individual, whole life          product. Whole life policies are a more expensive option than term life          insurance, however employees do not have to provide evidence of good health          to convert their coverage.                      Medical          Life is now offering a portability option in which separating employees          may apply to take their existing term insurance policy with them on a          self-pay basis. This less costly option requires that employee’s          provide evidence of good health and is not guaranteed to be issued.          However,          if the portability application is denied, employees still have the option          to convert their coverage. Ask your agency benefits office for the Medical          Life portability and conversion application forms ( Z6098           and  ML9212)  when you leave state service,          or you may download them from the Forms section of the Benefits Web site          at  www.ohio.gov/employeebenefits .                                                    Health        Care Spending Account                         T here          are many medical bills not covered by insurance. Examples include copays          and deductibles, a second pair of glasses, or the remaining expenses for          laser eye surgery or adult orthodontia.         Employees          will have an opportunity to set money aside on a pre-tax basis to help          cover such expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 2005.         The          Health Care Spending Account will allow individuals covered by a health          plan to set aside up to $500 in 2005 to cover these additional health          care costs. Receipts for eligible expenditures can be submitted to the          spending account vendor for reimbursement.                      To          judge the amount of money you may wish to put into your spending account,          you may wish to begin tracking those health care expenditures you make          this year that are not covered by insurance. Then when it is time for          you to determine the amount to set aside in your account, you can base          your decision on this year’s experience. Participation in the HCSA          program will be voluntary. Read more about it in future  Pathways .                                                          What’s        Your Reason for Quitting Tobacco?                         E veryone          has a reason to stop using tobacco. Whether your reason is your children,          your health, your wallet, your morning cough, your unborn child or the          smell of your clothes, there is a new service proven to help tobacco users          quit for good.           The          Ohio Tobacco Quit Line,  1-800-934-4840 ,          is a toll-free telephone counseling service that connects people who want          to quit using tobacco with trained counselors who can guide and support          them through the quitting process.          This          free service, provided by the Ohio Tobacco Use Prevention and Control          Foundation, is available in both English and Spanish to people calling          from anywhere in Ohio. Additionally, hearing -impaired individuals may          utilize a TTY by calling 1-888-229-2182.                                 Quitting now has            big benefits. Tobacco users start to realize the health effects within            20 minutes of quitting, reduce their risk of heart attack by half in            one year, and cut their risk of lung cancer in half by 10 years. It            is never too late.           State employees            also can receive help through the Ohio Employee Assistance Program (Ohio            EAP) which covers counseling service for tobacco cessation and can arrange            for group counseling at work sites.

Health        Care Consumerism                                    H ealth            care consumerism is a term that you will be hearing more and more in            relation to rising health care costs. Consumerism refers to the effect            that a consumer’s choices have and the reaction of providers to            those choices. Laser eye surgery provides a great example of consumerism            in action.           Most            insurance plans do not cover laser eye surgery because it is not considered            a medical necessity, yet patients are flocking to have the surgery performed            at their own cost.            Clinics            advertise discounts and package deals ranging from $2,000 to $990 to            get patients in the door. Patients, as the consumers, are looking at            the cost — and hopefully the quality — of the providers to            find the best product for the least cost, creating marketplace competition,            with the result that costs are held down.                                   For          consumerism to have an effect on the health care marketplace is a challenge.          Employees are inundated with information from a variety of sources, but          do not necessarily know which is the best option. Comparison data is almost          non-existent and expecting patients to comparison shop when they’re          dealing with expensive chronic conditions is unrealistic.          Costs          are increasing at an alarming rate. More and more, employers are forced          to shift these costs to their employees, or cut benefits altogether. Many          employers have begun to realize that viewing health care in a vacuum will          not work.         Managing          health care must be integrated with all facets of an employee’s life          and benefits, from preventive care to lifestyle changes, along with consistent          communication and education in costs and choices.                                   The            State of Ohio, in conjunction with the Joint Health Care Committee,            is examining ways in which state employees can be given more choices            and can become savvy health care consumers. Consumerism will become            a regular topic in  Pathways  for employees to learn more about            the changing health care market and how it is being addressed.                                                                      Long        Term Care Available To State Employees                                    W hat            exactly is long term care? While many people think that long term care            is a type of care provided only in nursing facilities, it is actually            much more than that. Long term care refers to a wide range of personal            care, health care and social services for people of all ages who can            no longer care for themselves because of chronic illness, long-lasting            disability or the effects of aging. It provides help with usual daily            activities such as eating, dressing or walking and it is often called            custodial care. Long term care is not like acute medical care which            helps people recover from an illness or injury.            Often,            long term care does not take place in a nursing home or other facility.            For every person in a nursing facility, it is estimated that there are            two or three people in a home environment with the same level of need.            Some 80 percent of these people are cared for by family members or friends.                                                        The          cost of long term care          In metropolitan areas, some nursing facilities now charge more than $160          per day — that’s $58,400 per year. Even care at home can cost          $20,000 a year. Many people believe that Medicare or their regular health          care benefits will cover these costs. But this is not true. Health plans          primarily pay for short-term medical care, not long-term custodial care.                   Medicaid          does cover long term care, but only for people living at or below the          poverty level. For many people, the personal and financial burdens of          this care are left up to the spouse and family — who often spend          their life savings in less than a year.          Aetna’s          Long Term Care Plan available to state employees is designed to fill this          need. The plan helps pay the cost of long term care, and also gives employees          the option to choose a level of coverage that suits their own needs and          budgets.                                   For            those who qualify for benefits, the plan reimburses daily expenses  from            $50 to $200  to help cover the cost of long term care in nursing            facilities or in home-care settings. You may enroll in this plan at            any time during the year.

How        To Avoid Shock At The Pharmacy                         H ave          you ever tried to get your prescription filled at the local pharmacy,          only to be told that your benefit plan doesn’t cover the drug your          doctor prescribed?            Or,          perhaps you learned the price for a mail-order prescription you fill every          90 days suddenly jumped from $20 to $60? To avoid shock at the pharmacy,          you have to learn the minute details about how your prescription drug          benefit works. Be sure to read carefully communications about your prescription          program.          Most          employment-based prescription drug benefits are administered by companies          known as pharmacy-benefit managers. The Ohio Med Plan and the HMOs use          Medco Health and others, including Express Scripts, as their pharmacy          benefit managers.         Employers          and insurance companies contract with pharmacy benefit managers to help          design prescription benefit plans, process pharmacy claims, and look for          red flags in drug usage. These pharmacy benefit managers negotiate with          pharmaceutical manufacturers for volume discounts on prescription drugs.          They employ medical professionals to recommend drug coverage and courses          of therapy. The pharmacy benefit mangers can decide which drugs will be          covered under the plan and at what price levels.                                  What          emerges is a list of covered prescription drugs, both generic and brand          name, called a formulary. A formulary is a list of medications that have          been determined to be clinically appropriate, and they’re the most          cost-effective for the drug therapy that is required.          Some          formularies are “closed”, meaning, if the prescription drug          is not on the list, it is not covered under the plan. Consumers who wish          to purchase that drug have to pay full price for it. The most generous          formularies, in contrast, are “open”. Plan members may receive          reimbursement for prescription drugs not listed on the formulary.         Tiered          formulary plans try to drive generic use by providing an impressive cost          incentive to consumers. These formularies typically divide prescription          drugs into three tiers: generics, ""preferred"" brands and ""non-preferred""          brands. Progressively higher ""copayments"" are assigned to each          tier. The state plan actually contains a fourth tier for ""non-preferred""          brands that have a generic equivalent. For these drugs, you will pay the          copay plus the difference in cost between the brand name drug and the          generic.Plans with a ""coinsurance"" approach, on the other hand,          require consumers to pay a percentage of the cost of each prescription          drug, regardless of whether it's a generic or brand name.                                   Formularies            usually give consumers a price break for selecting generic drugs. Generics            contain the same active ingredients as the brand names and have the            same medical benefits. Not all brand-name drugs have a generic equivalent            due to patent protections. But as more generics become available each            year, they’re gaining popularity with consumers.           Some            prescription drugs require prior authorization from your physician before            your plan will allow them to be filled at your pharmacy. This means            the drug is not favored as the first line of treatment for your condition.            It’s probably more expensive than the preferred drug but not necessarily            more effective. Your doctor may have to defend the choice before it            will be covered.           To            control rising drug costs, learn the incentives your plan offers. Be            familiar with your formulary and before you leave the doctor’s            office, ask your doctor whether a generic substitute is available for            your prescriptions. Ask about alternative courses of therapy that may            cost less under your plan and also whether you still need the prescriptions            you are currently taking, particularly if you’ve changed providers.

The cost of assisted living varies greatly, ranging from under $1,000 to over $5,000 per month. The average cost for a month is about $2,000. The variation is based on many factors, including:  The kind of and number of services  AND  HOW  TO  PAY  fee,"" ""community fee,"" ""deposit,"" ""activity fee,"" or any other of a number of names. Depending on the contract, you may recover all, part, or none of an initial or monthly fee when you leave. Most facilities base their fee on how much care you need. The facility evaluates you at the time of admission, and conducts re-evaluations regularly while you continue to live there. The more care that you need, the higher the fee. A facility may have several ""levels of care"" for which it charges.

Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know - 23   In addition to the basic monthly fee for each ""level of care,"" an assisted living facility may charge you for what it considers to be additional or extra services that are not included in the monthly charge.

Such ""extras"" may include:  Nursing service;  Incontinence care;  Extra assistance with daily tasks not         How To Pay For Assisted Living Except in the few situations mentioned below, very few government programs pay for assisted living. Almost all assisted living services are paid for by residents (or their families) out of their personal funds. Long term care insurance generally will pay for assisted living, but the insurance must be purchased in advance and paid for from personal funds. Health Insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid Many people think Medicare or private health insurance help pay for assisted living and other long-term care services. This is wrong. Medicare and private health insurance usually will not pay for the costs of assisted living. If you have limited resources, Medicaid may provide financial assistance under certain limited circumstances. Ordinarily, Medicaid is available for long-term care only if you reside in a nursing home. However, Maryland has a new Medicaid program that can pay for assisted living services if you meet its strict eligibility requirements. The new program is called the Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver Services for Older Adults (""Medicaid Waiver Program""). It serves a limited number of people. If all the openings are filled, Medicaid will not be able to pay for your assisted living services.    covered by the basic fee; Medication administration; Special diets, snacks, and room service meals; Maid service; Laundry; Cable television; Private telephone line and utility services; Personal services like barber or beauty parlor services; and Transportation.  The cost of assisted living care may very well exhaust your savings. Assisted living facilities are not obligated to continue to keep you if you cannot pay for services. Nonpayment will be a ground for discharging you. It is important for you to consider what would happen if your money ran out while you lived in assisted living, and to have a plan for that possibility.  24 - Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know   To qualify for the Medicaid Waiver Program, you must be at least 50 years old and meet both the medical and financial eligibility standards. To satisfy the medical standard, you must require enough care to qualify to live in a nursing home (even though you plan to live in assisted living). The financial eligibility standards are an income test and asset test. You must have limited income and assets to be eligible. The financial eligibility rules are complex, but basically, your assets have to be less than $2,500 or $2,000, depending on eligibility category, and your monthly income cannot exceed three times the SSI amount for a single person. This number is adjusted annually for inflation and is $1,635 in 2002. Medicaid will not count as assets, your or your spouses's, cars or pre-arranged funerals. Also, under certain circumstances, your spouse can keep up to half of your joint assets. The eligibility standards are too complex to be summarized in this booklet so for more information on eligibility for the Medicaid Waiver Program call the Legal Aid Bureau's Assisted Living Project or your local agency on aging. You can also get an application from your local agency on aging. See Chapter 9 for the agency on aging closest to you and the contact information for the Legal Aid Bureau. You can also get information from the Legal Aid Bureau's website at www.mdlab.org.  Senior Assisted Living Group Home Subsidy Program The Maryland Department of Aging has a limited subsidy program that you may be eligible for if you are elderly and live in an assisted living facility that participates in the subsidy program. Only facilities that have between four and sixteen beds participate in this program. There are often waiting lists for the program. To be eligible you have to have limited assets and income. While the numbers change from year to year, in order to be eligible at the time this booklet was printed in 2002 your monthly income would have to be less than $1,945 and your assets less than $11,000. To apply, or for more information, contact your local agency on aging. See Chapter 9 for the agency on aging closest to you. Long-Term Care Insurance Long-term care insurance can pay for assisted living. The cost of long-term care insurance varies greatly, depending on the options you select and your medical condition. If you already need assisted living services, you probably will not be able to purchase a policy. If you are over age 85, even if you are in good health, you may also have a hard time finding a policy.  Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know - 25   The older a person is when a policy is purchased, the more expensive the policy will be. However, even if it is too late for one spouse to purchase coverage, it may not be too late for the other spouse to buy a policy. Annual premiums can range from a few hundred dollars for a healthy 40-year old to thousands of dollars for a 70-year old. Most policies offer premiums that are ""level,"" that is, the rates do not change as you age. However, an insurance company typically can raise rates for a group of policyholders if it can show the rates are too low. Long-term care insurance policies are offered in many different options. It is very important for you to understand what a particular policy covers, as well as the rules affecting when the policy goes into effect. What services are covered Make sure the insurance policy includes assisted living care. It is a good idea to buy a policy that covers all types of long-term care: home care, day care, assisted living, and nursing home services. Long-term care insurance may not necessarily include assisted living services, although most policies written in the last few years will. Older policies may be limited to nursing home care or at-home care. The ""assisted living"" concept was not common until recently so many older policies do not mention it or cover it.  Tax Deductions Long-term care insurance premiums may be deducted from your federal income taxes. The deduction is based on the age of the person insured. The deduction covers only a small part of the actual insurance policy cost, ranging from about $220 for persons age 40 or less to about $2,700 for persons over age 70, but it should not be overlooked. Maryland offers a one-time state income tax credit of up to $500 for your purchase of long-term care insurance. A credit is different from a deduction in that the full amount is taken directly out of the amount of taxes owed to the State. For More Information For more information about long-term care insurance, contact the United Seniors Health Cooperative, 409 3rd Street SW, Suite 200, Washington, D.C. 20024, telephone (202) 479-6678; the Maryland Insurance Administration at (410) 468-2000 or 1-800-492-6116; or your local Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program. See Chapter 9 for information on your local Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program. Reverse Mortgages Reverse mortgages enable you to convert the equity in your home to cash. The cash can be spent to pay for assisted living. However, in most cases, to qualify for a reverse mortgage, there must be one borrower living in the  26 - Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know   home. So, if you are single, a reverse mortgage probably will not help with assisted living expenses. A reverse mortgage is based on your age, the value of your home, and interest rates. Reverse mortgages are available to you if you are at least 62 years of age. The value of the home will be less after you take out a reverse mortgage. This means that your heirs will receive less money than they would if there was no reverse mortgage on your home. Banks, mortgage firms, and financial service companies offer reverse mortgages. You should do a lot of research to make sure you find a reputable reverse mortgage lender. There have been unscrupulous people using the reverse mortgage idea to scam seniors. You should also shop around to compare options. For more information, contact the National Center for Home Equity Conversions at (651) 222-6775 or visit their website at www.reverse.org. Reverse mortgages can have substantial financial ramifications so you should contact a financial planner, accountant, or attorney before entering into one. Tax Deductions and Credits If you are paying your own pocket, all of the cost for living may be tax medical expense. out of some or assisted deductible as a To get the deduction,  a resident must be ""chronically ill"" and receive care prescribed by a doctor or another health care provider. See IRS Publication 502 for more information. To be considered ""chronically ill"" your doctor or other licensed health care practitioner must determine that you are unable to perform at least two activities of daily living for at least 90 days without substantial assistance from another or that you have a severe cognitive impairment (such as Alzheimer's disease) and need substantial supervision to be protected from threats to your health and safety. You can only deduct medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. Thus, you can only have a deduction for assisted living costs if your total medical expenses, including your assisted living costs, exceed 7.5 % of your adjusted gross income. Consult your tax advisor for more information about the tax deductibility of assisted living services.

GX266-31-9553099	"INSURANCE DEPARTMENT I. INTRODUCTION: INTERNAL SCAN  The Insurance Department is responsible for supervising and regulating insurance business in New York State. The Department's mission is to ensure the continued sound and prudent conduct of insurers' financial operations; provide fair, timely and equitable fulfillment of insurer obligations; protect policyholders from financially impaired or insolvent insurers; eliminate fraud, other criminal abuse and unethical conduct in the industry; and foster growth of the insurance industry in the State. The State's aging population will greatly impact on the Insurance Department's programs and policies with respect to automobile, property, life and health insurance and consumer protection and education. Since the trend of a healthier, more active senior population is expected to continue, there should be more focus on distribution and innovation in product offerings to better serve the needs of an expanding and multicultural senior population. Some aspects under consideration include: Automobile Insurance : Will seniors in 2015 be driving in daytime Will they be taking shorter, less frequent trips? Will they be subject to renew their drivers' licenses? Are they more or less likely to have they are driving fewer miles? What is the impact on auto premiums or off- peak hours? to re- testing in order accidents because for seniors?  Homeowners Insurance : Will seniors be more likely to own or rent in 2015? Will they live alone? Will the trend toward seasonal residence continue? Do they fully understand the coverages and exclusions that can apply in shoreline communities? Life Insurance : People who are living longer need to purchase products that will enable them to accumulate money (invest) and to liquidate or annuit ize that sum of money over their lifetimes so they will not outlive their funds. Pure protection life insurance (such as term life insurance) is geared more to younger people with dependents to support. The challenge to the industry in 2015 will be to re fine life insurance products to meet these changing needs, while at the same time not leaving out others who need pure protection. Health Insurance : As the population ages, there will be more interest in long- term care insurance, Medicare supplement policies and Medicare HMOs. Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) -- which are regulated by the Insurance Department along with the Department of Health and Office for the Aging -- will also play a more significant role by the year 2015. In addition, the financial stability of some health insurers could be at risk should premiums fail to keep up with the rising claims of an aging policyholder base.  159   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Consumer Protection and Education: As new products are introduced in the marketplace there will be an increased demand for consumer education and protection against fraud and abuse. Regulators will need to evaluate the implications of the following: Changing Methods of Distribution: There may be a decline in the role of agents for certain products and an increase of the Internet as a distribution channel of insurance. New Products : The insurance community (insurers, agents and regulators) attitudes and practices toward the senior market need to be redirected in order to identify this market and its emerging lifestyle changes and evolving needs. Information Technology : Baby boomers reaching retirement age may be more likely to use the Internet for research and pricing of insurance products than the current senior population as many are already familiar with computers and have access to the web. Regulators need to recognize the role of e- business in product administration, distribution and information sharing. For each line of insurance, the Department must ensure that new products developed for the aging population and others are easily understandable and provide meaningful coverage. The Department will continue to consider new and innovative means of educating aging citizens about the products most useful to them. The Department has over the past decade initiated numerous policies and procedures designed with the senior market in mind. The following reflects departmental initiatives to address demographic changes: Long -term Care Insurance : In 1993, the New York State Partnership for Long- term Care was initiated in New York State to encourage more people to purchase long- term care insurance policies. The Partnership Program allows those persons who purchase Partnership approved long- term care policies to qualify for Medicaid without spending down their assets once the benefits under the long- term care policy are exhausted. Medicare Supplement Insurance (aka Medigap insurance): Medicare supplement insurance is designed to supplement Medicare's benefits by paying some of the amounts that Medicare does not cover. A Medicare beneficiary cannot be turned down or charged higher premiums because of poor health. All standard Medicare supplement policies are guaranteed renewable. The Department provides information and assistance to senior citizens concerning Medicare supplement insurance and other coverages available to the elderly, such as long- term care insurance.  160   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC): CCRCs provide living arrangements, including long- term care commitments, to seniors who purchase living units within the community. The Department is responsible for: reviewing the contract and disclosure documents provided to residents as well as an initial determination of the financial feasibility of a proposed project; reviewing the rating str ucture of a community; assessing the adequacy of reserves; and conducting periodic on- site examinations of the financial condition of CCRCs. New Assisted Living Product : The number of persons residing at assisted living care facilities has dramatically increased in the 1990s. The Department has recently approved an ""Assisted Living Care Coverage Endorsement"". This optional endorsement extends coverage in the Homeowners policy to provide limited coverage for personal property, additional living expenses and liability to persons who reside in such facilities and are related to an insured. Senior Discounts on Homeowners Insurance : Some insurers offer discounts on home insurance to retirees or senior citizens. The Department has approved discounts when the homeowner is 55 years or older and the insured location is not unoccupied for an extended period of time. Senior Discounts on Automobile Insurance : Premium discounts for the mature driver are available from some insurers. There are several different age classifications, within which premiums generally tend to decrease as a person matures. However, some insurers also charge higher premiums for higher- age categories, as insurer statistics indicate that beyond a certain age the claims experience as a group worsens. Many senior citizens or retirees may also benefit from those insurers that vary their prices by the number of miles a car is driven each year, since they may drive fewer miles than the average insured. Viatical Settlement Companies/Senior Settlement Companies/Life Settlement Companies: Viatical settlements refer to the selling of life insurance policies by the insured party to a third party. The insured owner must be terminally ill (death anticipated within 24 months). The Department provides protections for seniors who decide to sell such policies. Senior or life settlement companies have begun to arise. These companies purchase policies of individuals who are not necessarily terminally ill. These types of settlements currently are not regulated by the Department. Consequently, seniors may become particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with this type of business. HIICAP: The Department's consumer services staff are members of the Health Insurance Information, Counseling and Assistance Program (HIICAP) consortium. This group is comprised of representatives from the Medicare servicing carriers, Medicare contractors, New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC), State Department of Health, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and IPRO (Island Peer Review Organization, a peer review organization for Medicare). The consortium meets annually to determine the training needs for HIICAP counselor and volunteers and whether there are changes at the Federal and state levels that might impact the insurance concerns of the aging.  161   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Department staff assists in developing the Training Manual for the program, conducting training, and responding to technical insurance questions. Consumer Education and Outreach: The Department routinely sends Consumer Services Bureau staff to senior centers to explain insurance issues and answer questions. The Frauds Bureau is gearing up to educate the public in the area of no - fault insurance fraud through a series of presentations in public and private venues. Emphasis will be placed on working with senior groups. Web Site : The Department's Web site provides senior citizens and others with access to comprehensive, up - to- date information on links to insurance companies, online complaint filings, disaster assistance, the Healthy New York program, Holocaust Victims resources, instructions on how to report frauds, tips on how to avoid becoming a victim. Publications on long- term care insurance and Medicare supplement coverage are also available on our Web site and through our toll- free publications telephone line. The Web site also has an interactive feature that allows visitors to have an online ""conversation"" with a NetRep. II. PRIORITY ISSUE AREAS  Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations. Health insurance is a key issue facing the aging population. The demands for long- term care (LTC) insurance and continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) products will increase dramatically over the next five to ten years. Effective and efficient planning is essential to accommodate the need for meaningful health insurance coverage and to ensure the financial solvency and market conduct of insurers providing such coverage. Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs. Education through outreach programs provides opportunities for seniors and others to learn about a multitude of existing and new insurance products such as longterm care, Medicare supplement, viatical settlements, homeowners and automobile discount programs. Many of these products are complex and not easily understood. Moreover, older citizens are frequent victims of fraud that can result in major financial, emotional and psychological hardship. This segment of the population is particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with cash settlement of life insurance policies prior to death to pay for care needs (viatical settlements), ""staged"" automobile accidents and sale of fraudulent investment instruments. Education and prevention initiatives can help safeguard seniors from fraud, criminal abuse and other unethical conduct.  162   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of information technology to benefit senior cons umers and to bridge the ""digital divide."" By 2015, a greater number of seniors will have access to the Internet to research and purchase insurance products online. It is important that we provide insurance information geared toward seniors on our Web site. We should also be working with other agencies to help bridge the ""digital divide"" that separate computer users from nonusers. III. ACTIONS AND RESULTS  Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations. Action: Amend Section 3111 of the Insurance Law to require third party notification, such as spouse or children, for long- term care policies regarding premiums due. Currently, this provision applies to Medicare supplement and other t ypes of insurance but not to long- term care. Result : The lapse rate for long- term care policies will decrease as a result of such legislation. As time passes some seniors may forget to pay their premium. When these policies lapse, it is virtually impossible to have them reinstated if the insured is in poor health. Action: Amend the Insurance Law Section 3216(c)(10) to extend the ""free look"" period after the purchase of long- term care policies from 10 to 30 days to provide consumers sufficient time to evaluate their policies. Currently, this is required for Medicare supplement policies. Result : The 30- day ""free look"" provision affords policyholders additional time to review and decide whether to keep the policy or return it for a full refund. Ten da ys is too short a period in which to review an insurance contract and make informed decisions. Action: Encourage more senior- oriented insurance products that will meet the needs of an aging population. For example, life insurance policies might combine a long- term care element with a life insurance component, while continuing care retirement communities could offer contracts that wrap around existing long- term care policies. Result : New York seniors would gain increased access to flexible, comprehensive insurance products that fit their needs. Action: Foster the growth of financially stable CCRCs for New York seniors.  163   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Result : Currently, only five CCRCs operate in New York State. As the aged population increases, these types of facilities would provide key health insurance and residential services to seniors who wish to remain in the State. Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs. Action: Establish, in conjunction with the Office for the Aging, a Seniors Advisory Council comprised of representatives from AARP and other senior groups to advise the Department regarding the insurance needs of New York's seniors. Result : A Seniors Advisory Council would provide valuable information on insurance issues facing that commun ity and provide feedback on Department initiatives directed towards seniors. Actions : Expand educational outreach and marketing programs to include:  Increased attendance and/or presentations at public events that attract the elderly, such as county fairs, meetings and conventions of senior citizens groups, etc.  Increased advertisements that attract an elderly audience.  Develop/update multi- lingual pamphlets and guides on senior issues, formatted for ease of readability and comprehension.  Develop a Mobile Information Center to disseminate information to seniors. A van would travel throughout the State with trained staff to answer insurance questions and solve problems.  Increase training to HIICAP volunteers and NYSOFA staff. Result : Ensure that information on health insurance and related topics is available to a greater segment of the older population including those who are not able to obtain information online and/or whose primary language is not English. Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of informa tion technology to benefit senior consumers and to bridge the ""digital divide."" Action: Establish a senior citizen section on the Department's Web site to include information on long- term care insurance, frauds prevention, CCRCs, Medicare HMO's (Health Maintenance Organizations), Medicare supplement insurance, senior discount programs, etc. This Web site will have a font size, layout and functionality to best meet the needs of the aged population and enable visitors to use the Net Rep feature currently available to all visitors. Further, coordinate the Insurance Department's information with other State agencies via online links from the NYS Citizen Guide, NYSOFA, Consumer Protection Board, NYS Department of Health, and others. Result : Provide user friendly, comprehensive information on the products and services available to senior citizens on a separate section of our Web site exclusively devoted to this segment of the population and via other senior- related Web sites.  164   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Action: Install kiosks in the I nsurance Department's offices and in other agencies to provide computer access to Department Web site and other information resources. Result : Increase consumer access to information and awareness of insurance services, products and issues.  165   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  166"
