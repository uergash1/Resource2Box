The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

For the earlier period, see  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954) .          Prominent figures of the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Top left:  W. E. B. Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.     After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).

Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 1 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 2 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 3 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 5 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 8 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 9 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 10 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 11 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 12 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [2]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 15 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 16 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 17 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 18 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 19 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 21 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 16 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 23 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 24 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 25 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [3] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 27 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 28 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 29 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 30 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [4]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 31 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 32 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .

Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 33 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 34 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 35 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 36 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 38 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.
