To do this, we provide access to information produced by the National Library of Medicine and  the National Institutes of Health, such as searches of MEDLINE, our database that indexes medical  literature, and ClinicalTrials.gov, the database of research studies from the National Institutes of Health. We also provide you with a database of full-text drug information, an illustrated medical encyclopedia, a medical dictionary, interactive health tutorials, and the latest health news.      In addition, MEDLINEplus contains pages that link to other web sites.  For example, we have Health Topic pages on over 600 diseases and conditions from Alzheimer's Disease to West Nile Virus.  We focus on organizing the full-text publications produced by the NIH Institutes and other federal government organizations. We also link to other web sites. The selection guidelines we use in evaluating links to web pages are listed below.
