In the  United States , a  do not resuscitate , or  DNR , order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  terminal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.

DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore ""giving up"", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically, these abbreviations are written without periods between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R. .   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

Pertinent issues addressed include the rights of children, surrogate   decision-making, the process of informed consent, and the roles   of surgeons and anesthesiologists. The reevaluation process   of DNR orders called ""required reconsideration"" can be incorporated   into the process of informed consent for surgery and anesthesia.   Care should be taken to distinguish between goal-directed and   procedure-directed approaches to DNR orders. By giving parents   or other surrogates and clinicians the option of deciding from   among full resuscitation, limitations based on procedures, or   limitations based on goals, the child's needs are individualized   and better served.

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        In the 1970s, the Critical Care Committee at the Massachusetts   General Hospital developed the original do-not-resuscitate (DNR)   guidelines in response to nursing requests for clarification   of what should be done when cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)   was unwanted or believed to be unwarranted by a patient or surrogate. 1   DNR orders are clinically and ethically appropriate when the   burdens of resuscitation exceed the expected benefit. Currently,   all hospitals seeking accreditation from the Joint Commission   on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations are required to   have a DNR policy in place. 2 – 6  This policy should define   a DNR order and describe the guidelines for its inclusion on   a patient's medical record. A DNR order is a written order by   an attending physician and precludes resuscitative efforts being   undertaken in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. DNR orders   should not have implications regarding the use of other therapeutic   interventions that may be appropriate for the patient, including   surgery and anesthesia. 7 , 8     The controversial topic of DNR orders for patients undergoing   surgery and anesthesia has received growing attention in the   medical literature since the early 1990s. However, the literature   does not specifically address the pediatric age group. For children,   DNR orders are written when (1) in the judgment of the treating   physician, an attempt to resuscitate the child would not benefit   the child and (2) the parent or surrogate decision-maker (with   the assent of an age-appropriate child) expresses his or her   preference that CPR be withheld in the event that the child   suffers a cardiopulmonary arrest, as long as this is in accordance   with the child's best interests. 7 , 9  DNR orders are written on   the assumption that cardiopulmonary arrest will be a spontaneous   event that is the culmination of the dying process of a child   who has a terminal illness or a poor quality of life. The dilemma   surgeons and anesthesiologists are confronted with regarding   children with DNR orders undergoing an operative procedure is   twofold: (1) anesthesia promotes some degree of hemodynamic   abnormality that may result in cardiopulmonary arrest, and (2)   many routine anesthetic manipulations can be classified as resuscitative   measures.     A number of hospitals across the nation still do not have a   policy that specifically addresses the extent to which DNR orders   apply in the operating room 2 , 5 , 10 , 11  or have a policy that mandates   suspension of DNR orders. 9  According to 1 study, surgical procedures   are performed in  15% of patients with DNR orders. 12  The American   Academy of Pediatrics and the American Society of Anesthesiologists   (ASA) have issued guidelines on forgoing life-sustaining medical   treatment, issues of informed consent, 13 , 14  and evaluation and   preparation of pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. 15  None   of these policies address in detail the approach to be taken   when an operative procedure is considered for a child with an   existing DNR order. This encounter includes the dilemmas of   who should assume responsibility (ie, the primary care physician,   the surgeon, or the anesthesiologist) for discussing with the   parent or surrogate decision-maker the potential risks of cardiopulmonary   arrest during surgery and anesthesia, whether the DNR order   should be temporarily suspended during the procedure, and how   long a temporary suspension should last if this option is chosen.                 SURVEY OF SECTIONS ON SURGERY AND ANESTHESIA      TOP   ABSTRACT   CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH...

Demographics of Respondents to Survey Regarding DNR Orders            For each group, surgeons and anesthesiologists, finite sample   confidence intervals for proportions were computed. 16  The finite   population correction factor was used for hypotheses testing   as needed. 16  Statistical software used included SPSS version   10 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL [2000]) and StatXact version 4 (Cytel   Software Inc, Cambridge, MA [2000]).     The majority of surgeons (88.8%) and anesthesiologists (86%)   had been asked to operate on or provide anesthesia to a child   with a DNR order in place at the time of surgery, and most indicated   that they would not refuse to provide these services. Most surgeons   (75.3%) and anesthesiologists (69.2%) would agree to honor a   DNR order during a palliative operative procedure, but smaller   percentages of surgeons (49.6%) and anesthesiologists (46.7%)   were willing to honor a DNR order during an elective operative   procedure. More than 95% of surgeons and anesthesiologists discuss   resuscitation issues before surgery with parents of children   who have standing DNR orders, and a majority of each group felt   that there should be a hospital policy for children with DNR   orders in the operating room. Only 50.5% of anesthesiologists   and 27.5% of surgeons stated that their hospital has such a   policy in place.     Surgeons and anesthesiologists then were asked which resuscitation   maneuvers should be withheld during intraoperative arrest in   a child with a DNR order.

The majority of anesthesiologists   (55.1%) felt that the perioperative period ended when the child   left the recovery room, with only 38.2% of surgeons agreeing   ( P  = .0037).

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        The medical literature contains some ambiguities on the scope   of a DNR order and the resuscitative interventions it prevents   during surgery and anesthesia. Resuscitative interventions may   be broadly defined as any maneuvers and techniques used to prevent   or reverse cardiopulmonary arrest. 17  However, this definition   is inappropriate in an operative setting, because anesthetic   agents routinely promote cardiovascular instability. 2 , 5 , 11 , 18   Perioperatively, resuscitative measures should only refer to   the measures undertaken to restore life once a cardiopulmonary   arrest has occurred. 8 , 19  Surveys of physicians and patients   with DNR orders confirm that clarification is needed on the   interpretation of a DNR order, especially its applicability   in the operating room. 12 , 20 – 22     Physicians caring for children have a duty to respect the wishes   of the child and family, to do good (beneficence), and to avoid   harm (nonmaleficence), which may lead to conflicting considerations   for a child with a DNR order. Some physicians believe that honoring   a DNR request harms a child by allowing a potentially reversible   death to occur. On the other hand, the child's welfare is best   served by not having a poor quality of life unnecessarily prolonged   and not having to endure ineffective therapy. 23  Older children   and adolescents should be included in the decision-making process   (patient assent) when their neurologic status, development,   and level of maturity allow. However, legally they require a   surrogate decision-maker to act on their behalf (surrogate or   parental permission). 14  A child's surrogate, usually a parent,   should be the person presumed to be the most appropriate and   capable to determine what actions would be in the best interest   of the child. Conflicts arise when the parent or other surrogate   and/or child and the physician fail to agree on what would be   optimal care under a given set of circumstances.      Informed Consent   To respect the child's and family's wishes, physicians must   obtain informed permission from a parent or surrogate before   a child can undergo any medical intervention including surgery   and resuscitation. Ordinarily, resuscitation efforts do not   require informed consent, because they are deemed emergency   interventions and consent is implied. However, terminally ill   or severely disabled children and their parents are often confronted   with the decision of whether resuscitation should be attempted   in the event the child's underlying disease results in cardiopulmonary   arrest.     Customarily, physicians will approach the parent or surrogate   about instituting a DNR order when it is felt that resuscitation   of the child would not be beneficial and would only prolong   the time to death. 22  When a parent or surrogate consents to   a DNR order, it is under the assumption that cardiopulmonary   arrest will be a direct consequence of the child's underlying   disease. Surgery and anesthesia constitute a change in the child's   medical status, because they introduce additional risks to the   patient. Because surgeons and anesthesiologists are rarely involved   in the original DNR decision, they cannot be certain that the   implications of the DNR status in the perioperative setting   were discussed with the patient's parent (or other surrogate). 3   Therefore, the parent or surrogate, the surgeon, and the anesthesiologist   should reevaluate the DNR order for a child who requires an   operative procedure. This reevaluation process has been called   ""required reconsideration"" 3  and should be incorporated into   the process of informed consent for surgery and anesthesia.   Discussions regarding consent under these circumstances should   be initiated by attending staff, particularly in hospitals with   residency teaching programs in which residents may be routinely   involved in the consent process.     The surgeon and anesthesiologist must approach the parents and   child with compassion. There is often no previous relationship   established between the patient, parents, and surgical team,   precluding a brief preoperative assessment. ""Active listening""   is essential. The parent or surrogate should be asked about   specific interventions and their understanding of the relative   merits of each of these interventions during resuscitation (Table   3 ). 15  Airway management should be determined by what is mandated   by the child's condition and the surgical procedure. Specific   prohibition of tracheal intubation is problematic, and beliefs   and concerns must be carefully elicited and discussed. Exceptions   to the injunctions against intervention should be specifically   noted in the patient's medical record. The parent may agree   to a temporary suspension of the DNR order during the perioperative   period. If so, the temporal end point to the DNR suspension   needs to be recorded as well. If an agreement cannot be obtained   after thorough discussion, the wishes of the informed parent   or surrogate must prevail. In some cases, the parents may feel   that the burden of a therapy is not worth the potential benefits   and decline the procedure. When an individual physician feels   that the parent's wishes are inconsistent with his or her medical,   ethical, or moral views, the physician should withdraw from   the case after ensuring continuity of care 13  and could consider   consulting the institutional ethics committee.            View this table:   [in this window]   [in a new window]       TABLE 3.  Potential Interventions During Resuscitation             Role of the Surgeon   The following are operative interventions that might be considered   for a pediatric patient with a DNR order:  Provision of a support   device that will enable the child to   be discharged from the   hospital (eg, gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy).      Urgent surgery   for a condition unrelated to the underlying chronic   problem   (eg, acute appendicitis in a terminal cancer patient).      Urgent   surgery for a condition related to the underlying chronic   problem   but not believed to be a terminal event (eg, a pathologic   fracture   or bowel obstruction).      A procedure to decrease pain.      A procedure   to provide vascular access.          It is the duty of the operating surgeon to discuss risks of   a procedure with the parent or other surrogate of any pediatric   patient, including how the patient's condition might influence   the risk of anesthesia. The American College of Surgeons (ACS)   issued a statement to guide surgeons in operating on patients   with an active DNR order. 24  The ACS statement does not make   specific reference to patient surrogates, although it is implied. 24   It is expected that the surgeon will advise parents or other   surrogates and the child (if developmentally appropriate) regarding   operative risks and benefits and advocate a policy of required   reconsideration of previous DNR orders. The results of all discussions   should be documented in the patient's medical record. The surgeon   should also ultimately convey the patient's wishes to the members   of the entire operating room team, help operating team members   understand the patient's or surrogate's wishes, and find alternate   team members to replace individuals who disagree with the patient's   or surrogate's wishes. With children, the difficulty arises   when there is no one who is willing to honor a family's wish   to continue the DNR status during the anesthesia and surgery.   Stalemates such as this should be referred to the ethics committee   of the institution.      Role of the Anesthesiologist   In 1994 and 1999, the ASA released recommendations on caring   for surgical patients with active DNR orders. 15  These guidelines   explicitly reject the practice of automatically rescinding the   DNR order before procedures involving the use of anesthesia,   because this practice ""may not sufficiently address a patient's   rights to self-determination in a responsible and ethical manner."" 15   The purpose of required reconsideration of DNR orders is to   determine what is best for the patient under the circumstances,   not to convince the patient and family to have the DNR order   suspended. The guidelines proposed by the ASA clearly recommend   that all physicians involved in the case (primary physician,   surgeon, and anesthesiologist) discuss together with the patient   (or other surrogate) the appropriateness of maintaining the   DNR order during the operation. The 1999 guidelines distinguish   between goal-directed and procedure-directed DNR orders. 15  Model   procedure-specific DNR documentation forms are published and   may be modified for individual hospital use. 9     A goal-directed approach focuses on the patient's goals, values,   and preferences rather than on individual procedures. The primary   goal is to do everything to prevent the need for resuscitation,   but if it occurs, this approach recognizes that patients are   often less concerned with technical details of the resuscitation   than with more subjective and personal issues regarding quality   of life before and after resuscitation. This model promulgates   an approach that honors the family's treatment goals while reflecting   the reality and unique aspects of the perioperative environment.   However, some anesthesiologists are uncomfortable with the indeterminate   nature of a goal-directed DNR order and have ethical or legal   concerns about having such crucial decisions rest solely on   their best judgment at the time of arrest.     Goal-directed DNR orders may be less feasible if the anesthesiologist   and surgeon caring for the child have not established a relationship   with the family before surgery. A procedure-directed approach   may be more appropriate in these circumstances, which involves   careful consideration of a series of specific interventions   that are likely to be used (Table  3 ). Each must be placed in   the context of the child's usual quality of life and likelihood   of the ability of the procedure to produce the desired effect,   given his or her unique physiology. This approach has limited   flexibility when an unexpected situation occurs. 9     Perioperative suspension of the DNR order is considered by some   anesthesiologists to be the ideal compromise, because it enables   the physician to act without restraint while providing the patient   with a realistic chance of achieving the operative goals. 10 , 25   Anesthetic agents and techniques may promote some degree of   hemodynamic and respiratory abnormality, especially in patients   with a deteriorated health condition. 2  The deliberate depression   of vital functions by the anesthetic may require resuscitative   measures to stabilize the patient. 11  Consequently, controversy   about the use of these interventions arises when the patient   has a written DNR order. Many of the routine anesthetic interventions   performed as part of operative maintenance are considered resuscitative   measures under different circumstances. These interventions   include the use of paralytic agents, vasoactive drugs, blood   products, and positive-pressure ventilation. This overlap in   terminology promotes confusion and inconsistencies among physicians   on the interpretation of a patient's DNR order and what it implies   in an operative setting. Keffer and Keffer 8 , 19  proposed that   resuscitation in the operating room be defined as ""those measures   undertaken to reestablish cardiac rhythm once a cardiac arrest   has occurred."" 8 (p644)  This definition establishes a simple end   point beyond which a patient's wish not to be resuscitated would   come into play.     The anesthesiologists' concern for patient comfort during the   procedure may support perioperative suspension of DNR orders.   An active DNR order restricts the physicians' ability to treat   any complications of their own procedure during anesthesia.   Faced with this dilemma, anesthesiologists are forced to decrease   the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest by increasing hemodynamic   stability through the use of less anesthetic. 2 , 11 , 26  For the   patient, this may potentially result in more discomfort and   suffering.     One reason to distinguish DNR in the operating room from DNR   in other settings is the difference in the success rate of CPR   administered for a spontaneous cardiopulmonary arrest versus   one that results from anesthesia. Anesthetic-related arrests   are believed to be more easily reversible because of the immediate   ability to respond and the controlled nature of the event. 3 , 19 , 26 , 27   One study of surgical patients suggested that when a cardiac   arrest was ascribed to anesthesia, 92% of the patients were   resuscitated successfully. 3 , 28  However, it is difficult to determine   how these statistics apply to terminally ill patients with a   DNR designation, because the survey was very broad and inclusive.   A more relevant survey was conducted on 4301 seriously ill adult   patients, and a few underwent an operative procedure and had   previously written DNR orders in their medical records. Only   3 of the 57 patients with DNR orders (5%) experienced an intraoperative   cardiopulmonary arrest, but all died within 5 days of operation. 29     Traditionally, CPR has been considered a success if the patient   survives the initial resuscitation effort. For patients with   DNR orders, the success of CPR may be better gauged on the length   of patient survival 7  and expected quality of life after resuscitation.   Using this definition, CPR may be inappropriate from the parent's   or surrogate's viewpoint if resuscitation has the overwhelming   probability of resulting in patient suffering and only prolonging   the time to death. 7  Anesthesiologists have the duty to inform   the parent or other surrogate of the risks and potential benefits   of intraoperative resuscitation. Required reconsideration as   part of the process of informed consent for anesthesia eliminates   ambiguities and misunderstandings associated with patients who   have DNR orders by providing anesthesiologists with the opportunity   to educate the parent (or other surrogate) to become familiar   with their values and perceptions of the child's quality of   life and together clarify how the child's DNR order should be   interpreted perioperatively. By giving parents or surrogates   and clinicians the option of deciding from among full resuscitation,   limitations based on procedures, or limitations based on goals,   the child's needs are individualized and better served. Regardless   of the decision made by the parent or other surrogate, the individual   acting on behalf of the child must be readily available for   consultation during the procedure. The ASA, like the ACS, advocates   that physicians withdraw from a case when they are unwilling   or unable to respect and implement a patient's (or other surrogate's)   decision to limit the use of resuscitation. 15 , 24      If DNR Orders Are Suspended: Qualification of Perioperative Interval   If the family or medical personnel involved in a child's care   choose to suspend DNR orders during anesthesia and surgery,   it is necessary to define the duration of suspension. 30  The   physiologic effects of anesthesia and surgery rarely terminate   at the end of the procedure, but the duration thereafter depends   on the anesthetic technique used and the type of surgical procedure   performed. The acute effects of most anesthetic medications   generally resolve within several hours or 1 day after surgery,   and most anesthesiologists visit the patient the day after a   surgical procedure and document recovery status in the patient   record. Recovery of respiratory function after surgery depends   on preoperative pulmonary function, chronicity of illness, and   length of the procedure. Some patients will experience cardiopulmonary   arrest during or immediately after surgery, which may be the   result of an acute and reversible complication. It is appropriate   to use mechanical ventilation after surgery as long as the patient   continues to show significant and sustained improvement in pulmonary   function. Once the patient ceases to recover or deteriorates,   withdrawal of ventilatory support should be considered. Generally   speaking, the suspension of DNR orders should continue until   the postanesthetic visit, until the patient has been weaned   from mechanical ventilation, or until the primary physician   involved in the patient's care and the family agree to reinstate   the DNR order.     The surgeon and anesthesiologist should feel comfortable, and   should be allowed, to reinstate a DNR order intraoperatively   through consultation with the family under certain conditions.   For example, if cardiac arrest occurs during surgery and it   is apparent that the arrest is the result of an irreversible   underlying disease or complication and that CPR would only allow   continued deterioration, the DNR order should be reinstated.   If resuscitation measures are withheld and intraoperative arrest   occurs, such a death should be classified as ""expected"" for   quality-assurance purposes rather than ""unexpected."" Expected   deaths do not require mandatory quality-assurance review. 18 , 31                 IMPLEMENTING ""REQUIRED RECONSIDERATION""      TOP   ABSTRACT   CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH...

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        Hospitals are encouraged to develop and maintain written policies   permitting the forgoing of life-sustaining treatment of patients,   including children, in appropriate circumstances. 13  Once a DNR   order is in place according to accepted standards, it is important   that it be reviewed before surgery to determine applicability   in the operating room and the postoperative recovery period.   Hospitals wishing to develop a ""required reconsideration"" policy   (Table  4 ) may want to address the following elements:  Include   in the discussion with a child's parent or other surrogate   information   about the likelihood of requiring resuscitative   measures, a   description of these measures and their reversibility,   the chance   of success, and possible outcomes with and without   resuscitation.   Establish an agreement about what, if any, resuscitative   measures   will be instituted during the procedure.      Make the decision   to uphold or suspend a DNR order on the basis   of the planned   procedure, the anticipated benefit for the child,   and the likelihood   of patient compromise as a result of the   procedure.      Document   the salient features of the physician-family discussion   in the   medical record.      Communicate plans to honor an intraoperative   DNR order among   relevant staff.      Require any physician or other   health care professional who   is unwilling to honor a family's   refusal of resuscitation to   withdraw from the case and allow   others to assume care. The   withdrawing physician or health care   professional should make   a conscientious effort to identify   another physician who is   willing to honor the DNR request. 13      Recognize that a patient's or surrogate's decision to refuse   intraoperative resuscitation can be compatible with the provision   of therapeutic measures to treat conditions other than arrest.   This decision does not necessarily imply limits on other forms   of care such as intensive care.      If the family chooses to rescind   the DNR order in the operating   room and arrest occurs with resuscitation,   but the patient's   process of dying has only been prolonged,   make a provision to   discuss withdrawal of life support after   a determined amount   of time. 3 , 5 , 19                 View this table:   [in this window]   [in a new window]       TABLE 4.

Clinical trials are research programs conducted with human volunteers to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug or device. Alexian Brothers is currently engaged in over 120 such clinical trials. Those who participate in clinical trials are often the first ones to receive an investigational drug or gain access to new treatments before they are widely available. By participation, you also contribute to our growing body of medical knowledge.    There are benefits and risks involved in participating in a clinical trial. Talk to your Alexian physician before deciding to join a trial. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews all Alexian clinical trials. An IRB is an independent body of medical, scientific, and community members who are responsible for ensuring the rights, safety, and well- being of human subjects involved in clinical trials.

clueweb09-enwp01-79-20486	"                     Do not resuscitate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  may not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .                 The  neutrality  of this article is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (February 2008)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In the  United States , a  Do Not Resuscitate , or  DNR  order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  inevitably fatal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.           Contents       1   Alternative Names   2   United States   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Alternative Names   Alternative namings and abbreviations for this order are used depending on the geographic region.  DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore 'giving up', some have advocated for these orders to be re-termed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically these abbreviations are written without periods in between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R.   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

Why doesn't NCBDE provide review courses or publish a study guide?          Are there professional practice experiences that are not considered diabetes education?          Who is eligible for certification as a diabetes educator?          What is diabetes self-management education?          Is there a maximum number of hours per week that may be claimed as diabetes self-management education?          How long is certification valid?

Where  can I find information on the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management  (""BC-ADM"") certification?                  Why  doesn't NCBDE provide review courses or publish a study guide?        As outlined in its Articles of Incorporation and  mission statement, NCBDE's responsibilities do not include the creation or  development of educational courses or materials. NCBDE believes that offering  preparation courses or study materials would constitute a conflict of interest  and could imply a guarantee of passing.             Are  there professional practice experiences that are not considered diabetes  education?        There are activities that are  not  considered diabetes education  employment for purposes of certification eligibility and should not be included  as part of Professional Practice Experience. While not an exhaustive list, the  following are examples of such activities:                diabetes  related functions performed as part of or in the course of other routine occupational  duties (e.g., routine nursing care, routine nutritional counseling, routine  pharmacy practice)              providing  continuing education to professionals (e.g., teaching nurses, physicians)              supervising  and managing other professionals              volunteer  activities, including diabetes camp              any  experience in a student capacity              membership  and committee work in professional organizations              providing  medical assessment, diagnosis, or treatment              conducting/participating  in research activities in which the individual is not involved in diabetes  self-management education             dispensing/prescribing  medications or diabetes supplies              promoting  or selling medications or diabetes supplies and products             employment by manufacturers of diabetes products and/or product services (e.g., insulin delivery devices)             having  diabetes or caring for a family member with diabetes              any  work or other experience prior to receipt of license, registration, or advanced  degree required for certification eligibility             any  work experience in practice settings outside the United States or its territories              any  work experience completed more than five years prior to the date of application              any  diabetes educator job in which diabetes self-management education is performed  less than 4 hours per week             employment  in one or more concurrent part-time diabetes educator jobs in which diabetes  self-management education is performed less than 4 hours per week in each job                                   Who  is eligible for certification as a diabetes educator?        The Examination is designed and intended for the  professional who has a defined role as a diabetes educator, not for those who  may perform some diabetes related functions as part of or in the course of  other routine occupational duties. Specific   eligibility  requirements  can be found in the Certification Handbook or on this site.             What  is diabetes self-management education?        Diabetes education, also referred to as diabetes self-management education or diabetes self-management training, is performed by health care professionals who have appropriate credentials and experience consistent with the particular profession's scope of practice. For purposes of this web site, diabetes self-management education (""DSME"") is used.             DSME is defined as the ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care. This process incorporates the needs, goals and life experiences of the person with diabetes and is guided by evidence-based standards. The overall objectives of DSME are to support informed decision-making, self-care behaviors, problem-solving and active collaboration with the health care team and to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life‡.         ‡National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education. American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care, Vol. 30, No. 6, June, 2007.        Is  there a maximum number of hours per week that may be claimed as diabetes  self-management education?        Yes, NCBDE has determined that 40 is the maximum  number of hours per week in diabetes self-management education that may be  reported when applying for certification. However, regardless of the number of  hours per week worked, it is important that the diabetes educator claim only  time spent performing diabetes self-management education. As in any job, there  is a certain amount of time not dedicated to primary responsibilities. Teaching  other health care professionals, completing administrative duties, planning for  a class, conducting a community health fair screening, are a few examples of  other responsibilities that may be not be counted toward meeting professional  practice requirements. Other examples are identified under the following FAQ:  Are there professional practice experiences that are not  considered diabetes education?             How  long is certification valid?        NCBDE  requires all CDEs to renew certification every five (5) years. It is the  responsibility of the individual certificant to keep abreast of any changes in  certification and/or renewal requirements. Valid dates of the credential should  be monitored and applications for renewal submitted by published deadlines.  Extensions of certification are NOT granted.             When  will I hear about the status of my application for the Examination?        For 2008 Examinations, see  Exam Application Status page . Information on 2009 application process will be published as it becomes available.        Where  can I find information on the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management  (""BC-ADM"") certification?        NCBDE does not administer or manage the BC-ADM  certification program. It is jointly sponsored by the American Association of  Diabetes Educators (“AADE”) and  the American Nurses Credentialing   Center.

Compared with standard physicals that typically only look at 20-40 biomarkers (proteins in the blood like glucose and cholesterol), Biophysical250 measures those same biomarkers, plus those used routinely by 12 different medical specialties, including cardiology, oncology and rheumatology, for a total of more than 250 different biomarkers.      With a blood sample of approximately two tablespoons, the Biophysical250 provides an assessment that can help indicate the presence of certain diseases and medical conditions at their earliest stages, often before symptoms appear.     ""Alexian Brothers is committed to providing extensive community health services and Biophysical is proud to be a part of their healthcare solution,"" said Dr. George Rodgers, president and chief medical officer with Biophysical Corporation. ""Biophysical250 will serve as an integral offering, and will enable Alexian Brothers' physicians and patients to better understand and manage their health in a much more comprehensive way.""     Patients will be able to provide a blood sample at the Alexian Medical Mall facility located in northwest suburban Schaumburg, while existing Alexian executive health program clients can opt to have the sample taken at their place of business. After receiving the Biophysical250 results, an Alexian Brothers physician will provide a personalized, comprehensive consultation explaining the report.      ""The leading causes of death and disability in this country are preventable. Millions of adults live with undetected illness. The Alexian Brothers Hospital Network in partnership with Biophysical Corporation will change the paradigm of healthcare,"" said Karen Giammicchio, director of Alexian's Center for Prevention and Early Detection, who believes that this advanced approach will serve patients and their desire to proactively monitor their health. ""Our goal at Alexian is to provide real immediate and long range impact on our patients' health and to empower them to make the right lifestyle changes to improve their health.""      The Alexian Brothers Center for Prevention and Early Detection offers an array of early detection screenings, including the BioAnalysis 360, a global approach to preventive medicine. The BioAnalysis 360 includes the Biophysical250 biomarker test, as well as a comprehensive personal and family health history, and a fully integrated professional team of healthcare providers and nurse navigators to guide patients through the process and results.
