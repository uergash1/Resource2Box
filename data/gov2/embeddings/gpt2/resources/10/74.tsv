GX242-36-5744744	"DRAFT GFS-BASED MOS WIND GUIDANCE FOR MARINE LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES by Christopher M. McAloon 1. INTRODUCTION The Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL) of the National Weather Service (NWS) has developed regression equations to predict the wind direction and wind speed at marine locations. The equations were derived by applying the Model Output Statistics (MOS) technique (Glahn and Lowry 1972) to output from the Global Forecast System (GFS) numerical weather prediction model (formerly know as the Aviation (AVN) model) (Kanamitsu 1989, Kanamitsu et al. 1991, Iredell and Caplan 1997, Caplan and Pan 2000). The new equations will be applied at approximately 121 National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys and Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations (Figure 5). The MOS wind guidance will be available for projections every 3-h from 6 to 84 hours after the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Forecasts at these stations will replace forecasts based on another statistical technique know as the modified perfect-prog approach, which used output from the Nested Grid Model (NGM) (Burroughs 1991). The NGM-based guidance was only available for 62 stations, and for 6-h projections from 6 to 48 hours from the initial model times of 0000 and 1200 UTC. 2. METHOD The MOS approach uses multiple linear regression to establish relationships between predictand data (station weather observations) and predictor data (output from numerical models, station observations, and climatic data). Predictors which correlate the highest with any of the three predictands (u- and v- wind components or the wind speed), when combined with the other predictors already selected, are chosen as terms in the regression equation. Predictors are chosen until none contributes more than 0.5% to the total reduction of variance or until nine predictors are chosen. Regression equations for the u- and v- wind components and wind speed are developed simultaneously. As a consequence, the same predictors are used in the equation for all three predictands with only the coefficients being different. The wind direction is predicted by using the u- and v- wind components. Wind speed is used as a separate predictand due to an under-forecast of the speed by the individual components. 3. DEVELOPMENT a. Seasons The developmental data set obtained for the majority of stations was from January 1997 through October 2002. Some stations became active during the middle of this period and a complete data set was not available. Equations were developed for both parts of a stratified sample composed of a cool season (October-March) and a warm season (AprilSeptember). Five seasons of data (approximately 900 days) were used to develop cool season equations and six seasons of data (approximately 1100 days) were used for the warm season equations. An additional 15 days on each end of a season were added, thereby smoothing the transition between seasons. b. Predictands Wind speed and direction are reported each hour at NDBC's buoys and C-MAN stations. The u- and v- wind components are computed from the wind speed and direction observations. NDBC archives reports of hourly data from all stations within their system. The historical sample of data used for the development of forecast equations was obtained from the NDBC website (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov). The observations of the wind speed and u- and v-   wind components were used for the hours of 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800 and 2100 UTC. These observations were then used to form predictands valid at projections from 6 to 84 hours from the initial model times. c. Predictors Predictors available for the development of forecast equations originate from three possible sources: GFS model variables interpolated to the station, surface observations, and climatic variables. The GFS forecast of u- and v- wind and wind speed from 10 m as well as 1000-, 925-, 850-, 700-, and 500-mb levels were used as predictors. Other model variables included were the relative vorticity, vertical velocity, and relative mass divergence from the levels of 925-, 850-, 700-, and 500-mb. The model forecast of atmospheric stability through the layers 1000-925 mb, 1000-850 mb, and 1000-700 mb were also potential predictors. Mean relative humidity was available through the layers 100-850 mb, 850-700 mb, and through the sigma layer from 1-.44 sigma. The final model variable used was the K-index. Model predictors were valid at the concurrent time as the predictand with the exception of the 81 and 84 hour forecast projections. Due to a lack of sufficient model data at 81 and 84 hours the predictors from the 78 hour projection were used as 81 and 84 hour predictors. The predictors from the GFS model were space smoothed by using 25 grid points to reduce the noise of the model forecasts at small scales. In addition to the model forecast variables included as predictors, climate variables and observations were also available. The climate predictors were based on the sinusoidal nature of the calendar year at a particular station, i.e. the first and second harmonics of the day of the year. The observations were the u- and v- wind components and the wind speed. The observations were only used as predictors for the 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-hr forecast equations. The observations used were valid 3 hours after the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. At the early projections (6 to 15 hours), the most common predictors included in the forecast equations are the 3-hr observations and the model forecasts of the u- and v- wind components and wind speed at 10 m. In later projections the model forecasts of u- and v- wind components and wind speed at 10 m are most common. The 925-mb relative vorticity is also frequently included in the forecast equations at later projections as well as the first and second harmonics of the day of the year. d. Equation Development Each of the approximately 121 buoy and C-MAN stations have their own individual forecast equation valid for the particular season and forecast projection in question. The only current exception to this is for the buoys in Lake Superior and Lake Huron during the cool season. The three Lake Superior buoys each use an equation based on a combined development sample of predictand data from all the buoy and C-MAN stations in Lake Superior. The two buoys in Lake Huron use an equation based on a development sample of predictand data for both stations combined. This procedure was performed because of the limited sample of predictand data available in this region due to the removal of the buoys in the cool season. Because C-MAN stations are land sites, their sample is not affected and they still use single station equations. During the warm season each station has its own forecast equation. Recall that each of the three predictand equations are developed simultaneously. The predictor with the overall highest correlation with any of the predictands is chosen as the first predictor and incorporated into an equation for all of the predictands. The predictor with the next highest correlation with a predictand in combination with the previously chosen predictor is then added to the equation. This process continues until nine predictors are chosen or until none of the remaining predictors can reduce the variance of any one predictand by more than 0.5%. As a consequence of the simultaneous development only the predictand coefficients are different for the three predictands. For the 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-h projections, a second set of equations is developed. These equations do not have observations included as predictors. Those which have observations are known as ""primary"" equations and those that do not are known as ""secondary"" equations. The secondary equations are used when observations are not available as predictors during real-time forecast guidance preparation.   e. Post Processing A number of post processing measures are performed on the forecasts of u- and v- wind components and wind speed before they are disseminated. The first step inflates the wind speed forecasts (Carter and Schwartz 1985). This process increases the frequency of strong and weak wind forecasts, thereby increasing the standard deviation of the wind speed forecast distribution. In doing so, the mean absolute error of the wind speed forecasts is also increased. Next, the wind direction is computed from the u- and v- wind components of the wind speed. The wind speed is also checked to be sure it is non-negative due to the inflation routine which could conceivably ""create"" negative wind speeds by decreasing the value of some low wind speeds. Finally, when the wind speed is less than 0.5 knots, the wind direction is set as ""calm"". A new routine developed specifically for the marine wind guidance adjusts the forecast wind speeds to be consistent with a wind speed measured at 10 m. The 10 m height is not only a WMO standard, but also the observing height for all National Weather Service Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) stations. However, many of the NDBC buoys measure wind speed at a height of 5 m, while C-MAN stations measure wind speeds at varying heights. The adjustment performed on the wind speed forecast is based upon the power law wind profile (Hsu et al. 1994)   z2  u2 = u1    z1   011 .  (1)  where u1 and u2 are the forecast wind speed before and after the correction, respectively, z1 and z2 are the original observation height and the adjustment height (10 m), respectively, and the power of 0.11 is a constant derived empirically from near-neutral conditions over water. 4. VERIFICATION Prior to the development of operational equations, test equations were developed for the 0000 UTC cycle of the and cool seasons. The test equations were developed by using cool seasons from October 1997 through March The test equations for the warm season were developed by using data from April 1997 through September Forecasts were made from these equations by using independent data from the 2001-2002 and 2002 cool and seasons, respectively. These forecasts were compared to the direct model output from the GFS model as well NGM-based statistical guidance described in the Introduction. warm 2001. 2001. warm as the  The scores used in the verification of wind speed were the mean absolute error (MAE), probability of detection (POD) of a wind speed greater than 22.5 kts, the threat score of a wind speed greater than 22.5 kts, and the Heidke skill score. The scores used in the verification analysis of wind direction were the MAE and the cumulative relative frequency of errors less than 30 when the observed wind speed is at least 10 kts. Figures 1-4 summarize four of these scores in graphical form. The verification figures shown compare the new GFS guidance to the NGM guidance, therefor projections are only shown out to 48 hours and only 62 sites were included in this overall verification. The results of verification indicate that the new GFS-based marine MOS based guidance and the GFS direct model output during the sample period development in the marine environment, including, air temperature and numerical weather prediction models may be used to develop marine MOS data will also be considered to create a larger overall MOS network. 5. OPERATIONS AND DISSEMINATION The operational guidance for the 6 through 84 hour projections from the 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC forecast cycles will be issued in a set of alphanumeric messages. These messages will be disseminated through the Telecommunications Gateway to the Satellite Broadcast Network, Family of Services, Tropical Predictions Center, guidance indicated. dewpoint guidance. performs better than the NGMMDL will also undertake future temperature. In addition, other Additional observation network   Ocean Prediction Center, National Data Buoy Center, National Ocean Service, and the National Center for Environmental Prediction Centers. These messages will be distributed with the World Meteorological Organization headers given in Figure 5. The alphanumeric message will be described in the following section. The forecast guidance will also be issued in a binary format, for use, most notably, by the NWS forecasters. This guidance will be in supplement to the current MOS wind guidance based on the AVN model (Sfanos 2000). In addition, 91 of the 121 sites will have probability of thunderstorm and conditional probability of severe thunderstorms given within this binary message. Thunderstorm forecasts will not be in the alphanumeric messages. Given the adjustment of the wind speed forecasts based upon the anemometer height, users of these forecasts are advised that the adjustment is derived from idealized conditions and applied universally to all buoys. This adjustment may not be appropriate for all conditions and users should make themselves aware of situations when this may be the case. In addition, the variability among anemometer heights will likely dictate the situation when this adjustment may or may not be appropriate. Users should also note that forecasts for buoys in Lake Superior and Lake Huron are based on equations developed for a region. However the adjustment made at each of these buoys is based upon the anemometer height of that individual buoy. The MOS wind speed and direction forecasts are based on the GFS model output. When using a statistical technique such as MOS, forecast accuracy is only as good as the information input by the forecast model. If a user of these forecasts feels that the model may be in error, they should adjust the forecasts accordingly. The MOS technique is known to account for some model biases, however it cannot account for a bad model forecast. When observations are not available in real time secondary equations are used in making forecasts at projections 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-h, as described in Section 3d.. The skill of these secondary forecasts may be less than those if primary equations were used. 6. THE ALPHANUMERIC MESSAGE The alphanumeric message containing the GFS MOS wind speed and direction guidance at marine locations will be the first to present the forecast for projections every 3 hours from 6 to 84 hours. Historically, the message has been limited to a 69 character width. Consequently, the message containing the marine wind speed and direction forecasts is a modification of the current AVN MOS message that will show all 27 forecast projections. The message will contain the forecasts of wind speed and direction at the site, as well as a wind speed adjusted to be consistent with 10 m. The most significant difference between the format of the current AVN message and this message, is that the additional forecast projections (69- to 84-h)are in a second block of text placed below what would be the block of text representing the current AVN message. 44013 GFS DT /APR 30 HR 12 15 WD 36 03 WS 11 08 WS10 12 08 DT HR WD WS WS10 /MAY 03 01 15 16 06 01 15 16 3 MOS GUIDANCE /MAY 18 21 00 03 07 10 13 14 07 11 10 08 07 11 11 08 09 01 17 18 12 01 18 19 15 02 19 20 18 03 15 16 1 06 13 08 08 4/30/2003 09 12 09 10 12 12 10 11 15 14 13 14 18 16 13 14 0600 UTC /MAY 21 00 03 17 19 20 13 12 11 14 13 12 2 06 20 12 13 / 00 02 10 11  09 20 13 14  12 20 11 12  15 24 09 10  18 02 11 12  21 05 07 08  In this example, the message is valid for the buoy east of Boston, MA (44013). All stations are identified by the NDBC assigned call letters. The ""GFS MOS GUIDANCE"" appearing on the same line as the station call letters identifies the message contents. The date of the forecast cycle during which the message is issued follows this   information. The form of mm/dd/yyyy where mm is the month (1 through 12), dd is the day (1 through 31), and yyyy is the four-digit year is used. The forecast cycle is identified by the standard 0000, 0600, 1200 or 1800 UTC. In this example, the MOS guidance for 44013 was issued from the 0600 UTC forecast cycle of the GFS on April30, 2003. The DT and HR lines denote the date and hour at which the forecasts are valid. The DT line indicates the day of the month. Note that the month is denoted by the standard three or four letter abbreviation. For wind direction and speed, the date and hour denote the specific time that the forecasts are valid. These forecasts are valid every 3 hours until 84 hours after initial time. Note that the DT and HR lines for the forecasts valid 69 hours after the initial time and later are in the second block of text. The station wind direction (WD) and speed (WS) forecasts are for winds at the height of the anemometer. The wind direction is given in tens of degrees and varies from 01 (10 degrees) to 36 (360 degrees). The normal meteorological convention for specifying wind direction is followed. The wind speed is given in knots; the maximum speed allowed in the message is 98 knots. For both direction and speed, missing forecasts are denoted by 99. A calm wind is indicated by a wind direction and speed of 00. The adjusted wind speed (WS10) is a forecast of wind speed at a height of 10 m above the surface. It is derived from the wind speed forecast given by WS. The adjustment is described in Section 3e. 7. REFERENCES Burroughs, L. D., 1991: Coastal and offshore wind guidance.
