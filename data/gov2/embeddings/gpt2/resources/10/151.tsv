GX061-36-10364993	U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact    CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   San Bernardino County is located approximately 60 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and extends to Arizona and Nevada.  Covering 20,000 square miles, San Bernardino County has the largest land area of any county in the continental United States, larger than the states of Rhode Island, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Hawaii, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont.  Between 1970 and 1980 the population more than doubled, rising from 684,072 to 1.4 million.  The County consists of three geographically distinct areas -- the Inland Valley, the San Gabriel/San Bernardino Mountains and the Mojave Desert.     The County of San Bernardino is a qualified urban county entitled to receive Federal Housing and Community Development Grant funds from HUD as a consortium of unincorporated communities and 17 cooperating cities.  The cooperating cities are Adelanto, Town of Apple Valley, Barstow, Big Bear Lake, Chino Hills, Colton, Grand Terrace, Highland, Yucaipa, Victorville and the Town of Yucca Valley.  The County Consortium represents 53 percent of the total County population.  The remaining cities in the County (Chino, Fontana, Hesperia, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino and Upland) qualify as entitlement cities and have chosen to participate directly with HUD.   Action Plan   In Fiscal Year 1995-96, the County Consortium will use $16 million in Federal funds to implement a strategy that will provide additional affordable housing and community development projects.  These funds include over $12 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, $3.3 million in HOME investment Partnership (HOME) funds, and $.3 million in Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funds.   Citizen Participation   To encourage citizen participation, the County Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) asked each of the 17 municipalities participating in the County Consortium to conduct at least one community forum to identify housing and community development needs.  The forums were designed to gather citizen input on programs that might benefit each community's lower income residents.  During November and December 1994, 17 separate forums were held throughout the County, and the overall attendance exceeded 330.   During the same period, surveys were mailed to the eight entitlement cities within the County.  San Bernardino County consulted with neighboring counties to solicit input from jurisdictions that might overlap or otherwise affect its programs.  The County also consulted with 24 county departments, 106 community-based organizations, 189 organizations providing services to the homeless, and residents of public and Section 8 housing.   The identified needs were summarized in a report presented to the Board of Supervisors.  This report determined the priority needs, objectives, and actions listed in the Consolidated Plan.          COMMUNITY PROFILE   Sixty miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, San Bernardino County borders the north and east metropolitan areas of Orange and Los Angeles counties. Like other counties in Southern California, San Bernardino has experienced rapid growth during the past two decades. Between 1970 and 1990, the population increased by more than 107 percent, rising from 684,072 to 1.4 million.   The county's population growth has been affected by the economies of Orange and Los Angeles Counties and has been concentrated in areas adjacent to these jurisdictions or within commuting distance to them. Additional growth can be attributed to immigration from Mexico, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim.   The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects that the county's population growth will continue. SCAG is predicting a 54-percent increase between 1990 and 2010. During this same period, the number of housing units is expected to increase by 77 percent, while employment is expected to increase by 73 percent.   The 1990 census reported that the county's median age was almost 28. Adults between the ages of 25 and 54 comprise 43 percent of the population. School age children between the ages of 5 and 18 comprise nearly 23 percent. Elderly persons over the age of 65 comprise less than 9 percent.    The racial and ethnic composition of the entire county changed significantly during the past decade. The white non-Hispanic population decreased, falling from 73 percent in 1980 to 61 percent in 1990. The Hispanic population increased, rising from 18.5 percent to 26 percent. Although the overall proportions of African Americans and Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders are small, these groups increased by 137 percent and by 273 percent, respectively.    The estimated 1994 median family income (MCI) for the Riverside-San Bernardino County metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was $42,300, slightly higher than the national average but lower than MCI for Orange ($59,100) and Los Angeles ($45,200) Counties. In 1990 about 12 percent of the county's households were extremely low-income (0-30 percent of MCI); 11 percent were low-income (31-50 percent of MCI); 17 percent were moderate- income (51-80 percent of MCI); and 8 percent were middle-income (81-95 percent of MCI). Nearly 25 percent of all households in the county were in the low-income category, and 57 percent of those households lived in County Consortium areas.         HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   According to the 1990 census, 465,877 households reside in San Bernardino County, a countrywide increase of 56,566 since 1980. Of these, 254,935 households (more than 50 percent) live in the County Consortium area. Overall, the average household size has increased from 2.8 persons in 1980 to 3.4 in 1990.   The 1990 census indicated that San Bernardino County had 588,501 housing units. Of these, 67 percent were single-family dwellings, and 25 percent were multifamily dwellings.   The county's vacancy rate was 18 percent. However, this high figure can be attributed to the California recession and to the large number of seasonal units, which account for 33 percent of all vacant units. Furthermore, 16,507 vacant units were for sale.   The housing stock is relatively new. Nearly 50 percent all units were built between 1980 and 1989; 33 percent of the units were built between 1960 and 1979; and 21 percent were built before 1960. Less than 2 percent of the stock is substandard and not suitable for habitation.   Housing Needs   The 1988 a State-mandated Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) prepared by SCAG estimated that between 1988 and 1994, the county would need to provide an additional 55,886 housing units to accommodate projected population growth.    The 1990 census found that 47,489 households (10 percent) are overcrowded. Nearly 60 percent of all large renter households live in overcrowded conditions.    Housing Market Conditions   Despite low interest rates and low housing prices, real estate sales remain sluggish in Southern California and in San Bernardino County. Since 1990 the real estate market has been stimulated by job market recovery, declining home prices, and increasing affordability levels. Moreover, population growth and years of recession have created a pent-up demand for housing. However, lingering anxiety about employment stability and fears that housing prices may fall further continue to depress the market.   In 1994 home prices for the area averaged $148,198, falling by 1 percent since 1993 and by 15 percent since 1991. Also during 1994, resale prices averaged $132,563, falling by 2.2 percent since 1993 and by 7.7 percent since 1991.   The closing of Norton and George Air Force Bases in San Bernardino County and the realignment of March Air Force Base in neighboring Riverside County has profoundly impacted the county's housing market.   Affordable Housing Needs   Housing affordability is the overwhelming problem facing many San Bernardino County households. Predictably, lower income households and renters most often experience housing cost burdens. Of all households, 165,559 (35 percent) are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing expenses. Of these, 45 percent are renters, while the remainder are homeowners. Among extremely low-income households, 75 percent are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and 61 percent are severely cost-burdened, paying more than 50 percent. Among low-income households, two-thirds are cost-burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and one-third are severely cost-burdened, paying more than 50 percent. Overall, cost burdens affect more renters than owners.    Although 85 percent of African American and 89 percent of Hispanic renter households report housing problems, those ethnic groups are not disproportionately represented among the lower income groups experiencing housing problems.   Homeless Needs   In conjunction with the Homeless Coalition, the County has identified 3,081 homeless persons, with nearly half of them being children. Of the total homeless population, 45 percent are females, and 20 percent of all homeless households are headed by women. African Americans comprise 20 percent of the homeless population but only 8 percent of the county's total population. The most frequently cited causes of homelessness include evictions, job loss, and alcohol and drug abuse.   The San Bernardino County Homeless Coalition lists 37 homeless service providers and 8 homeless shelters within the county. Several county departments also provide shelter assistance for the homeless and homeless people with mental illness.   Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The Housing Authority of San Bernardino owns and manages 12 public housing sites containing 2,018 units, which can be occupied by extremely low- and low-income households.   Currently, 1,877 applicants are on the waiting list for public housing units in County Consortium jurisdictions. A waiting period that can last between 2 and 3 years discourages many interested and eligible families from applying for the units. The Housing Authority has not received allocations to develop additional public housing units since 1988.    The Housing Authority also assists approximately 2,400 low-income households living in the County Consortium area using its Section 8 certificate and voucher program. In mid-1994, 3,961 applicants appeared on the waiting list for Section 8 assistance.   Of the 32 housing projects built by private developers who used Federal housing assistance, 4 projects in the County Consortium area will be eligible for repayment by 2000, relieving their owners from reserving units for lower income residents.    Through its Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, the county has provided nearly 1,600 affordable units. Developments financed with such assistance must reserve 20 percent of all units for families earning less than the area MCI and must limit rents to 30 percent of gross income. The county offers mortgage revenue bonds to finance housing construction, using a program that assists low-and moderate-income homebuyers. San Bernardino County also grants a density bonus to developers who reserve 25 percent of all units for lower income households.   Barriers to Affordable Housing   The basic factors that might constrain affordable housing -- such as land use controls, building codes, processing procedures, and development fees -- do not significantly impede the expansion of the county's affordable housing supply. Sufficient land is available to accommodate the projections of the 1988 SCAG housing needs assessment. Enforcement of the State-established Uniform Building Code constrains development only to ensure public health and safety. Processing times for project proposals conform to State requirements. Although impact fees and requirements that force developers to make offsite improvements add to the cost of housing, these fees and requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of life within a community.   Fair Housing   The county contracts with the Fair Housing Council of San Bernardino County, Inc., which helps housing industry groups to implement the Voluntary Affirmative Marketing Agreement and to disseminate information on fair housing opportunities. The council also provides educational assistance on equal housing purchase opportunities. Furthermore, the county contracts with the Inland Mediation Board, which provides tenant-landlord counseling and education on fair housing laws.   Lead-Based Paint   In 1991 the State of California established a program that requires all children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years be tested for lead poisoning. Of the 165,285 children living in San Bernardino County, 25,737 were screened during a 2-year period beginning in 1992. Of these, 70 children had extremely high blood-lead levels, and 146 met Federal case definitions requiring public health follow-up.    Other Issues   Special needs households that require assistance to find affordable housing include the elderly, the disabled, and persons with HIV/AIDS. Housing affordability is a concern among elderly households and renters on fixed incomes, because housing costs often increase faster than incremental income adjustments.    An estimated 11 percent of the county population is disabled. Physically handicapped people often require dwellings that have specially designed access features.   The San Bernardino County Department of Public Health reported that the county has 1,420 cases of AIDS and 3,300 cases of HIV. These persons may need housing assistance sometime during the progression of their disease.   Community Development Needs   Each of the 17 cities and 9 unincorporated areas in the County Consortium identified community development needs, including public facilities, infrastructure, public service, and economic development. Overall, 12 communities identified a need for improved accessibility; 10 identified graffiti removal; and 1 identified rehabilitation for a reservoir damaged during an earthquake.   Coordination   The County Board of Supervisors appointed the Department of Economic Development (ECD) as the agency responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing the housing and community development plan.         HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Housing and Community Development Objectives and Priorities   The county's strategic plan has four elements: an affordable housing plan, a homeless plan, a special housing needs plan, and a non-housing community development plan.   Housing Priorities   The main thrust of the County Consortium's strategy is to promote the expansion of housing opportunities for extremely low-income households. Low-income households are also assigned high priority.   To expand the supply of affordable housing, San Bernardino County will use two mechanisms. First, to provide affordable housing, the county will continue to support activities of non-profit housing developers and the County Housing Authority. Second, to stimulate production and to remove obstacles that inhibit the construction of affordable units, the county will continue to provide developers with incentives, including bond financing, density bonuses, priority processing, and fee waivers.   Over the next 5 years, the county hopes that at least 1,000 affordable rental units for low- income families will be built using mortgage revenue bonds designed to finance multifamily rental projects. The county also hopes that its bonding authority will fund at least 500 low- interest mortgages for low- and moderate-income families and will help 275 low-income families to buy a home through the HOME program.   San Bernardino County is applying for a one-time grant of $800,000 through the HOPE III single-family homeownership program. The county will use these funds to acquire and rehabilitate five dwellings, reselling the units to low-income families.   To reduce housing costs to extremely low- and low-income households, the county will provide these households with ongoing monthly rental assistance and security deposit assistance. The county will insulate and weatherize 10,000 units, using funds from State, Federal, and local sources and from the region's gas and electric utilities.   To preserve the existing stock and other affordable units for extremely low-, low-, and moderate-income households, San Bernardino County will rehabilitate approximately 200 multifamily and single-family rental units, rehabilitate 200 owned residences, and repair 1,500 senior owned residences.    The Housing Authority has adopted a 5-year plan that will encourage residents to participate in resident councils, training, active partnerships, and a homeownership program.   The County Homelessness Plan calls for development of a continuum of care that includes: providing the homeless with cold weather shelters and support services, offering prevention services to 85 families threatened with homelessness, and providing services and outreach at a domestic violence shelter. The county will support the Housing Authority's application for a $1 million formula grant from Section 8 rental assistance program. This grant will provide at least 30 homeless families and individuals with permanent housing.    Non-housing Community Development Priorities   Because of Southern California's recessionary economy, both tax revenues and charitable contributions to non-profit service providers have fallen. Consequently, the inventory of community development needs has grown dramatically.   Public facility needs include building and rehabilitating senior centers, child-care centers, and playgrounds. San Bernardino County also plans to acquire park land, to improve existing parks, and to finance seismic safety improvements.   Infrastructure activities include improving flood drainage, water systems, streets, and streetscapes.   As part of a long-range plan to develop a diverse network of needed services, the county will to help provide or augment public services, such as: senior citizen outreach; social, health, housing, and youth services; drug abuse prevention, recreation, and cultural-access programs; outreach and counseling; education, training, and referral services; and blight abatement.   Accessibility needs include removing barriers at public facilities in 10 communities and installing accessible park playground equipment in another community.   During the next 3 to 5 years, the county hopes to design historic preservation improvements for Barton House in Redlands and to complete preservation improvements for the Assistencia Mission in Redlands and the Twenty-Nine Palms School House.   To meet economic development needs, San Bernardino County hopes to provide business expansion loans that will leverage additional private financing and equity investment while creating or retaining 300 jobs. The county also expects to provide nearly $475,000 in Economic Development Initiative (EDI) funds that will be used as a debt service reserve and as capital for a small business financing program. To implement a countywide business financing program, the county will combine the EDI funds with Section 108 funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).   Over the next 3 years, the county will complete code enforcement inspections in Apple Valley, Barstow, Highland, Montclair, and Colton. The county will also demolish and remove abandoned or unsafe buildings in unincorporated areas of the Second and Third Supervisorial Districts.   Anti-poverty Strategy   The Community Services Department of San Bernardino County is the primary agency responsible for administering the county's anti-poverty programs. Its major responsibilities include providing job training, energy conservation and weatherization assistance, income management counseling, and rent subsidies.    Housing and Community Development Resources   To implement the strategic plan, the county will use CDBG and HOME funds as well as resources from other Federal programs, including: the HOPE programs, Shelter Plus Care, HUD Section 202 loans, and Family Self-Sufficiency Program.    Available State resources include funds from a State emergency shelter program and a program that finances rehabilitation of rental units for low- and moderate-income renters living in rural areas. The California Housing Finance Agency administers programs which are financed through mortgage revenue bonds issued by San Bernardino County.   The county also expects to receive the support of several quasi-public entities, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank. The county will also have access to loan pools maintained by the Savings Association Mortgage Company (SAMCO) and the California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC).   Coordination of Strategic Plan   As lead agency for implementing the strategic plan, ECD will strengthen and expand the partnerships that it has developed with public and assisted housing providers, service agencies, non-profit organizations, and government entities. To retain and recruit commerce and industry, ECD will cooperate with economic development organizations within the county. To identify overlapping priority needs and to collaborate in developing mutual benefit proposals, ECD will coordinate with entitlement cities.         ONE-YEAR ACTION PLAN   Description of Key Projects   In 1995-1996 numerous key projects will be funded using more than $16 million in CDBG funds. These projects include major countywide activities, such as a $1.8 million Economic Development and Business Expansion Program, $2.3 million for housing development and preservation and smaller activities in individual cities and unincorporated areas throughout San Bernardino County.    Locations   Approximately 53 percent of the county's CDBG entitlement will be reserved for activities that benefit the entire County Consortium area. The cities of Redlands and Rialto, as joint CDBG applicants, will receive 60 percent of the entitlement allocated to them for city projects. The county will distribute the balance of its entitlement to participating cities and unincorporated areas, using population, extent of poverty, and extent of overcrowding as the determining factors.   Lead Agencies   Although city councils from each participating city identify priority needs and fund allocations for their jurisdictions, the Board of Supervisors makes all final decisions concerning priority needs and allocations.

The following topics and points summarize the issues and options on mayoral succession identified in this preliminary report for consideration by the Commission. Line of Succession  Issue: Who should be the first in the line o f succession? Options: Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, Vice Mayor, Deputy Mayor.    Issue: Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? Options: There are many permutations of who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession.  Term of Acting Mayor  Issue: If the Commission proposes not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve f the or remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor? Options: The approach set forth in the General City Law is that the successor becomes the Mayor for the remainder of the term. In the current succession provision, a general election is held to choose someone to fill out the term. The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a special election. The current Charter approach was considered for mayoral vacancies by the 1999 Commission.  i   Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices (Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, and Council member) provide for a nonpartisan special election. The alternative, of course, is to provide for partisan elections.  Timing of Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i .e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide generally for a special election after 45 days from the vacancy. Experience throughout the country varies. Considerations include the identity of the office of the interim successor and the amount of time the public would need to educate itself about the candidates.  Special Elections: Runoff Provision  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be he ld if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices do not provide for a runoff, although one was proposed by the 1999 Commission.    Issue: If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Options: The 1999 Commission proposed a trigger of 40 percent, with the top two candidates advancing to the runoff. Other choices (such as a trigger of 25 percent or three candidates advancing) are, of course, possible. These permutations must be analyzed in light of voting rights implications.  ii   Need for General Election  Issue: Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide, in the usual case, for a general election to fill the remaind er of the term.  General Election  Issue: If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a partisan general election. The Commission's deliberations on the issue of nonpartisan elections in general may be relevant to a determination on this question.  Special Considerations  Issue: What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate? Options: If the choice for which office the Acting Mayor comes from is considered by the Commission the correct one on the whole, but one that has some drawback, the Commission might propose to shorten the time until the special election, for example, in order to address the issue.  iii    Introduction Overview of the Charter Revision Process The New York City Charter is the basic document that defines the organization, power, functions and essential procedures and policies of City government. As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Char ter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and other State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority, however; for example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected official. A cha rter can also be revised pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put proposals before the voters. A charter revision commission may put proposals before the  1   voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through local law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a ma yoral charter commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the  commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commission. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to submit a new charter or any amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a  commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire charter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893 (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are othe rwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL. The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be  2   voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b). The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

They are as follows: Anthony Crowell, Co-Executive Director, has been a City attorney for five years. He served as General Counsel and staff counsel to the 2001 and 1999 Charter Revision Commissions. Prior to joining the City in 1997, he managed government affairs and policy at the International City/County Management Association in Washington, D.C. He teaches State and Local Government Law at Brooklyn Law Sc hool. Jan English, Co-Executive Director, has over 23 years of City service. She directed administration for the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. Currently, she  serves as Deputy Commissioner at the Department of Juvenile Justice; she has als o served in that capacity at the Departments of Probation and the Trade Waste Commission. Bradley Tusk, Co-Executive Director, recently rejoined City government after serving as a senior aide to Senator Charles E. Schumer. Prior to that he served as a senior aide to former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern. An attorney, he has served as an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University. Howard Friedman, General Counsel, has been a City attorney for 7 years, serving currently as Senior Counsel at the Law Department. He has served on the legal staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He has extensive City legal  experience and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He has also been a Legal Aid attorney.  8   Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others, the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance and Probation, the Business Integrity and Anti -Corruption Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsel Dara Jaffee; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director Anne Fitzgibbon; Analyst Talya Sheinkman, and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho. Most of these staff members served on the staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. How the Commission's Staff Developed Its Options Report on Mayoral Succession In preparing this report, the staff took its direction from Commission Chair Robert J. McGuire and the Commission members. The staff also looked to the reports and records of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. Each of those Commissions  produced reports and heard testimony on the issue of mayoral succession. In addition, the Commission's staff solicited input from the public, conducted new research, contacted other cities to learn of their experiences, engaged the services of expert co nsultants, and consulted with various City officials, including other City lawyers and Charter experts, and election and campaign finance officials.  9   Mayoral Succession  Issue: Should the Charter's provisions governing the filling of mayoral vacancies be revised? Relevant Charter Provisions: Mayoral succession is governed by Charter  10. Other provisions that are relevant to a discussion of mayoral succession are Charter  8(f) (mayor's power to delegate functions, power, and duties), 24 (powers of the public advocate and succession), 25 (council member election and vacancies), 81 (borough president election and vacancies), and 94 (comptroller vacancies). Discussion: 1. Introduction The issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two major issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. In evaluating these issues, the Commission must weigh a number of policy  considerations. These considerations include:    Who should be the first in the line of succession? Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? If the Commission chooses not to keep the portion of the current system relati ng to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor?  10         If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? If a special election is provided for, what should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? If a special election is provided for, should a runo ff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate?     Elections to complete the term While the City has a consistent system for filling vacancies in almost every elected City office, the office of the Mayor is the exception. Voters are currently empowered to fill a vacancy in any other elected office by, in the usual circumstance, special election within 45 days of the vacancy. 1  The City now has over a decade of experience with these  special elections, which were established by the 1988 Charter Revision Commission. The Commission may wish to consider whether the filling of mayoral vacancies should occur in the same manner. Section 10(b) of the Charter currently provides that, upon a permanent vacancy (i.e., failure to qualify, resignation, removal, death, or permanent inability to discharge powers and duties), the powers and duties of the Mayor devolve upon the Public  1  Regarding succession to the office of the Public Advocate, see footnote 10.  11   Advocate, the Comptroller, or a person selected by the Council, in that order of succession, until a new Mayor is elected. If the vacancy occurs prior to September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election of that year. If the vacancy occurs on or after September 20 in any year, it is filled at the general election held the following calendar year. 2  The result of this provision is that, if a vacancy were to occur on or after September  20 in any year of the Mayor's term (except the last), the interim successor (e.g., the Public Advocate) could potentially serve as Acting Mayor for more than 15 months before an elected Mayor takes office. This system contrasts sharply with the election system for filling vacancies in other elected offices, where voters are given the opportunity to elect a successor in short order. The office of the Mayor is obviously a crucial one. It is the seat of executive power in the City's governmental structure and is the focal point of policies affecting the lives of City residents. As the City's chief executive officer, the Mayor is most responsible for the effectiveness and integrity of City government and is the City's most politically accountable elected official. Providing for the prompt selection of a new Mayor by the voters in the event of a mayoral vacancy appears closely related to issues of democracy, stability, and effective government. Accordingly, while the current succession provision ha s been in place for many years, this Commission may wish to consider amending the Charter to allow voters a more prompt opportunity to vote for the person who will lead them. Furthermore, if the Commission does decide to consider a change to the election provisions for succession, it will need to consider options as to the timing of those elections. While vacancies in other City offices are filled, in the usual circumstance, by a special election within 45 days of the vacancy, the Commission may want to co nsider 2  The person elected at a general election would then serve until the end of the original mayoral term.  12   recommending that a mayoral special election occur within 75 or 90 days of a vacancy, in light of the high-profile nature of such an election, in order to provide more time for campaigning and voter education. 3  Who should serve as Acting Mayor pending an election? The Commission may want to consider whether the Public Advocate should remain first in line to be interim successor to the Mayor. There are benefits and drawbacks to having the Public Advocate be the first interim successor. The benefits are that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected office and has a Citywide constituency. The  drawbacks are that, in the event of a vacancy, particularly in times of crisis, the Public Advocate would often be someone who lacked sufficient executi ve knowledge of the City's operations to ensure stability in the City, simply because of the day-to -day ombudsperson role played by the Public Advocate. In such a circumstance, someone such as the  Comptroller or the First Deputy Mayor may be a more appropriate successor. Portions of the discussion below, including the sections on the history of the current mayoral succession provisions and on the options for which might be the most appropriate office to be first in line for succession, are relevant to the Commission's consideration of this issue.  3  A special election to select an interim Mayor within 90 days of the vacancy has been suggested by The New York Times (Editorial, July 9, 2002).  13   2. Background and History For over 25 years charter revision commissions have considered the issue of mayoral succession. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission's discussions on succession are particularly re levant to the issue of who the first successor should be, because that Commission had to address the issue within the larger context of the abolition of the Board of Estimate (""the Board"") and its replacement with the City government structure we have today. For most of this century, the Board was the most powerful and important governing body of the City. At the time of its abolition in 1989, the Board was comprised of eight members: the Mayor, the City Council President, and the Comptroller, each of who m had two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each of whom had one vote. Membership on the Board was the most significant source of power for the office of the Council President. The Board exercised authority over some of the City's most important functions and responsibilities. It participated in the budget process, granted leases of City property, and maintained final authority over the use, development and improvement of City land, including through zoning regulations. It also had final approval of all capital projects and City contracts that were not awarded through competitive sealed bids. While the Council had the power to pass local laws and participate in the budget process, and the Mayor was responsible for implementing the City's programs, the Board possessed authority over important policy decisions that affected the City on a daily basis. In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court, in Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989), declared the Board's voting scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Because Borough Presidents held equal  14   amounts of power on the Board, the Court held that residents of some less populous boroughs, such as Staten Island, were over- represented, while residents of relatively more populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, were under- represented. The Court ordered the City either to reorganize the Board or abolish it. Between March 22 and August 2, 1989, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission worked to comply wi th the Court's ruling. The 1989 Charter Revision Commission proposed to abolish the Board and create a new governance structure for the City that would receive the Board's powers. The  Commission wanted to continue the City's tradition of a strong mayoralty and, therefore, it transferred many of the Board's functions to the Mayor. The Commission also decided that the Council, as the legislative branch, should be the primary check on the mayoralty. The Commission expanded the Council's membership from 35 to 51 members, and granted it power to approve the budget and authority over land use decisions. The 1989 Commission continued the offices of the Comptroller and the Borough Presidents but with significantly different powers than they had enjoyed by virtue of their seats on the Board. The Comptroller retained certain executive - like functions including the duty to audit every City agency at least once every four years. Borough Presidents lost a significant amount of power with the end of the Board, but retained appointment powers with respect to community boards and were given some control over funding for their boroughs. The City Council President's role in government underwent a major transformation as a result of the 1989 Charter revision, which eliminated the Board of Estimate and, of course, the Council President's votes on the Board. Like the Mayor and Comptroller, the Council President enjoyed two votes on the Board and thus had the ability to exercise  15   significant influence over budgetary issues, land use decisions, approval of contracts, and zoning regulation changes. The duties of the Council President outside of the Board, however, were limited. As the Council's presiding officer, the Council President could cast a vote to break a tie but was not permitted to vote under any other circumstance. The Vice-Chair of the Council (predecessor to the position of the Speaker) was the person who effectively led the Council, not the Council President. Although the Council President had little input regarding the day- to-day workings of the legislative body, he was the immediate successor to the mayoralty. This arrangement was rational because the Council President had the same number of votes on the Board as the Mayor and was involved in the day-to -day executive decisions of the Board. With the elimination of the Board came a heated debate over whether to redefine the Council President's responsibilities or whether instead to eliminate that office altogether. It is widely understood that the 1989 Commission ultimately retained that office as part of a political compromise: certain Commissioners did not want then-Council President Andrew Stein to be ousted from City government. Indeed, Commission Chair Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. has since acknowledged that the office was kept, in part, to keep the Commission's majority coalition from falling apart; he noted that this issue aroused ""puzzling passion."" 4  In the 1989 Commission's ""Summary of Final Proposals,"" the Council President is described as ""the city's `Public Advocate' . . . charged with receiving, investigating and attempting to resolve individual citizen complaints.""5 4  The Public Advocate has been  Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. & Eric Lane, The Policy and Politics of Charter Making, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 723, 818, 820 (1998). 5 Summary of Final Proposals, New York City Charter Revision Commission, August 1989, at 19.  16   described as the country's only elected ombudsman.  6  In 1993, the City Council passed  Local Law 19, officially changing the title of that office from ""President of the Council"" to ""Public Advocate."" In passing that law, the Council acknowledged that ""the most important duty of the President of the City Council is to serve as the public advocate for the citize ns of New York City."" 7  In short, it appears that while the succession provision empowering the Council President, now the Public Advocate, to succeed to the mayoralty has remained constant, the nature of the Public Advocate's office has been radically transformed, and now bears little resemblance to that of its predecessor under the Board of Estimate system. 3. Review by Previous Commissions  Both the 1999 and the 2001 Charter Revision Commissions reviewed the issue of mayoral succession. These Commissions analyzed different options for an appropriate interim successor in the event of a mayoral vacancy as well as the need to hold a special election following the vacancy. 1999 Charter Revision Commission The 1999 Commission reviewed whether the Charter's provisions for filling mayoral vacancies should be amended to provide for a special election or a different successor or both. In its report to the Commission, issued July 22, 1999, the staff analyzed these issues, considering factors such as the need for stability and continuity in the event of a vacancy, succession systems in major cities throughout New York State and the country, and the legal issues implicated by a change in the City's mayoral succession system.  6  Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y. L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093, 1095 (1998). 7 Memorandum in Support, Local Law 19 of 1993.  17   One such legal issue was the question of whether a change to a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would violate the federal Voting Rights Act. The  Commission retained Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, Chair of the History Department at American University and a noted voting rights expert, to provide a detailed analysis of this issue. Dr. Lichtman ultimately concluded that there was no evidence that special elections for Citywide offices would disadvantage minority voters or result in relatively larger reductions in minority voter tur nout. Based on this and other expert testimony, the 1999 Commission concluded that its proposal for filling mayoral vacancies with special elections would not violate the Voting Rights Act. 8  The Commission's ultimate proposal regarding special elections, contained in its September 1, 1999, final report, provided, in essence, that a nonpartisan special election would be held within 45 days after the occurrence of a vacancy, with a runoff election held if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote. A partisan general election would then be held to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In addition to the special elections issue, the 1999 Commission also analyzed options regarding who could serve as the interim successor to the Mayor in the e vent of a vacancy. The offices of Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, a (newly created) Vice Mayor, and Deputy Mayor were identified as possible successors. The Commission concluded, however, that it would not propose any change to the line of succession. The issue of mayoral succession received much public comment. A summary of the comments that were received by the Commission is attached as Appendix A.  8  The 2002 Commission has directed the staff to hire Dr. Lichtman to study this issue further in relation to this Commission's work.  18   2001 Charter Revision Commission The 2001 Charter Revision Commission also considered t he issue of mayoral succession. Ultimately, while the Commission stated that the City should adopt special elections to fill mayoral vacancies and should remove the Public Advocate from the line of succession, it concluded that such Charter reform should not be proposed to the voters ""on the eve of elections for every citywide office."" A summary of the public comment on succession issues received by the 2001 Commission is attached as Appendix B. 4. Succession in Other Major Cities  A comparison of the mayoral succession provisions for other cities in New York State and across the United States shows the wide variety of approaches cities have taken to address the issue of succession to the mayoralty. Other Cities in New York Under General City Law  2-a(1), where the mayor and the presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time, for the same term, by the electors of the entire city, the presiding officer becomes mayor for the remainder of the term in the event of a vacancy. As discussed below, New York City's existing mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), which differs significantly from Section 2 -a(1), is given effect as a grandfathered exception to that section. See General City Law  2-a(3)(b). Of the other cities in New York State described in this section, some are governed by Section 2-a(1), while others are not so governed, because the conditions set forth in that section are not met.  19   Albany.  A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Counc il President, who  serves as Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Buffalo. The vacancy is filled by the City Council President for the remainder of the unexpired term. Rochester. The Council appoints a successor, who must be registered in the same party as the vacating Mayor. An interim Mayor is then elected for the remainder of the  unexpired term at the next general election for which there is time to file nominating petitions. If the Council fails to appoint a successor within 30 days of the vacancy, a special election must be held within 90 days of the vacancy to elect a successor to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. As the President of the Council is selected from among the members of the Council, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 a(1) does not apply. Syracuse. The Council President succeeds to the mayoralty for the remainder of the unexpired term. Yonkers. A vacancy in the office of the Mayor is filled by the City Council designating a deputy mayor, commissioner, or department head as acting Mayor. A special election to fill the remainder of the term is then held 90 days after the vacancy or as soon thereafter as legally possible. If the vacancy occurs within 180 days of the regular mid-term If the  municipal election, the special election is held concurrently with that election.  vacancy occurs within 180 days of a regular mayoral election, no special election is held. As the Mayor has a four - year term and the City Council President has a two - year term, the succession rule set forth in General City Law  2 -a(1) does not apply.  20   Mayoral Succession in Other Selected United States Cities The succession provisions for major cities throughout the United States fall into three main categories: (a) cities where the mayor appoints the person who is the  successor; (b) cities where the City Council President becomes the Mayor; and (c) cities where the City Council chooses the successor. Details of the various succession systems vary by city. Such details include the qualifications of the interim successor, whether a special election is held to fill the remainder of the term, and the length of time before such an election is held. A number of major cities throughout the U.S. hold special elections in the event that a Mayor leaves office. These cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati,  Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon, Orlando, Phoenix, Providence, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. Furthermore, many cities have endorsed the  designation of a mayoral appointee as the interim mayor. These cities include: Cleveland (Law Director), Denver (Deputy Mayor), and Cincinnati (Vice-Mayor; member of Council selected by Mayor), Houston (Mayor pro tem, member of Council nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by Council) and Kansas City (Mayor pro tem; member of Council appointed by Mayor). On the other hand, many cities take other approaches. 9  Charts summarizing various approaches taken by major U.S. cities are attached as Appendix C.  9  One factor that may affect the approach a city takes is whether the city's form of governme nt follows a ""strong mayor"" model, as New York does, or instead a ""council/city manager"" model. If the Commission so desires, the staff can analyze the U.S. cities listed in terms of this factor.  21   5. Related State and Federal Law Issues State Law While the options regarding changes to the mayoral succession system that the Commission might consider implicate provisions of State law, the Staff has concluded that the various options discussed so far are completely consistent with State law. For example, as discussed in prior years, one option the Commission might consider is proposing a change to the system of mayoral succession elections to provide for prompt nonpartisan special elections, as is provided for in the Charter for vacancies in all other City elective offices. See Charter  24 (public advocate), 25 (council members), 81 (borough presidents), and 94 (comptroller). This existing Charter procedure was  upheld in City of New York v. Board of Elections , Index No. 41450/91 (Sup. Ct. New York Co.), aff'd __ A.D.2d __ (1st Dep't), lv. den. , 77 N.Y.2d 938 (1991). The City's procedure was upheld, on municipal home rule grounds, against a claim that the Charter provisions were preempted by inconsistent provisions of the State Election Law. See State  Constitution, Article IX; Municipal Home Rule Law  10; Election Law  1-102; and Bareham v. City of Rochester , 246 N. Y. 140 (1927). 10  10  It should be noted that the special election provision intended to be triggered by a vacancy in the office of Public Advocate has never been precleared by the Department of Justice. While the provision must be precleared before it can be implemented, the 1988 Charter Revision Commission recommended that State law be changed prior to the City seeking preclearance. Specifically, that Commission was concerned that General City Law  2-a(2) might preempt the Charter's provisions regarding Public Advocate vacancies, because it mandates that the vice-chairman of the local legislative body, i.e., the Speaker of the Council, becomes the presiding officer of the Council, i.e., the Public Advocate, for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, to the extent that the Commission proposes to remove from the Public Advocate the now ceremonial role of presiding over the Council, see Charter  24(e), the concern of the 1988 Commission would become moot because the terms of GCL  2- a(2) would, on their face, no longer apply. See discussion of GCL  2-a(1) and 2 a(3). In that event, the provisions regarding who shall be the interim successor to the Public Advocate pending a special election, in the event of a vacancy, may need to be clarified.  22   To the extent that the Commission decides to propose any change to the terms of mayoral succession, whether as to the interim successor or the form of elections, General City Law  2-a(1) is implicated. Under this provision, where a city's mayor and the  presiding officer of the local legislative body are elected at the same time for the same term by the voters of the entire city, the presiding officer of the legislative body becomes the mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term. Currently, as the Public Advocate ""presides over"" the Council, Charter  24(e), and is elected at the same time as the Mayor, for the same term as the Mayor, by the voters of the entire City, the terms of Section 2-a(1) would seem to apply. However, the City's current mayoral succession provision, Charter  10(b), is ""grandfathered"" as an exception to Section 2-a(1) by General City Law  2a(3)(b). Because this exemption from application of the provisions of Section 2-a(1) arguably would not continue, however, after modification of any of the current mayoral succession provisions, it would arguably be necessary for the Commission to propose the elimination of the Public Advocate's ceremonial right to ""preside"" over the Council, so that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place.11 Alternatively, the Commission might choose to propose amending the starting point of the Public Advocate's term, so that it would not run concurrently with the term of the Mayor. Again, this approach would mean that the terms of Section 2-a(1) would not apply in the first place. However, it should be noted that this approach might create additional complications regarding, for  11  Under Charter  24(e), a major power of the Public Advocate that relates Council is the ability to break a tie vote. However, under Municipal Home local law requires a majority affirmative vote of the total voting power of Charter  34 (passage of local law or resolution requires majority affirmative Thus, 26 affirmative votes are needed in the Council to pass any local law. tie vote is extremely unlikely.  to the power to preside over the Rule Law  20(1), passage of a the legislative body. See also vote of all the council members). In light of this fact, a meaningful  23   example, the application of term limits.  Under either approach, the Public Advocate's  aut hority to introduce legislation in the Council would not need to be changed. Federal Voting Rights Act A change in the rules governing mayoral succession could arguably be considered a change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."" Such a change could require the City to seek preclearance from the Justice Department pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act, a State or political subdivision may not impose a ""standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . ."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(a). In establishing whether such an abridgement has occurred, one must determine whether, ""under the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [i.e., race or color] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice."" 42 U.S.C.  1973(b). Whenever the City seeks, in general, to change a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting ,"" it seeks preclearance from the Justice Department as to whether the change will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C.  1973c. The change may not take effect until the City receives preclearance. Id. When preclearance is sought from the Justice Department, the change may take effect if ""the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval  24   within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."" Id. As to preclearance of a change such as one to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions, which would require approval by referendum, see Municipal Home Rule Law 23(d), Charter 38(3), the Department of Justice has set forth instructions regarding the timing of such preclearance. Under 28 C.F.R.  51.22, entitled, ""Premature submissions,"" The Attorney General will not cons ider on the merits: (a) any proposal for a change affecting voting submitted prior to final enactment or administrative decision or (b) any proposed change which has a direct bearing on another change affecting voting which has not received Section 5 preclearance. However, with respect to a change for which approval by referendum, a State or Federal court or a Federal agency is required, the Attorney General may make a determination concerning the change prior to such approval if the change is not subject to alteration in the final approving action and if all other action necessary for approval has been taken. It thus appears that the Justice Department could, but would not be required to, consider for preclearance any change to the Charter's mayoral succession provisions prior to approval by the voters at referendum. In 1999, the Charter Revision Commission's consultant, Dr. Allan J. Lichtman analyzed whether establishing a system of special elections to fill mayoral vacancies would have a detrimental impact on voting power or representation of the City's minority communities and thus violate the Voting Rights Act. He analyzed recent special elections in the City and other municipalities with high minority populations. Specifically, he  analyzed data for seven special elections for State Assembly and Senate, Congressional and Council positions between 1992 and 1998. Dr. Lichtman also reviewed special  elections in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Memphis. He found no evidence to support a  25   conclusion that New York City mayoral special elections would be likely to disadvantage minority voters by producing large reductions in minority turnout relative to the reductions in white turnout. Indeed, he inferred from the data that in a Citywide special election  minori ty turnout would likely be high relative to white turnout if a minority candidate or choice of minority candidates was competing for office. The Commission also consulted on this issue with Gerald Hebert , a legal expert on the Voting Rights Act, who worked at the Department of Justice for over 20 years and served as Acting Chief, Deputy Chief, and Special Litigation Counsel in the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. After reviewing the opinions of Professor Lichtman and Mr. Hebert, the Commission concluded that filling a mayoral vacancy through a special election (using the procedure proposed by the 1999 Commission) would not violate the Voting Rights Act. Consequently, at this time, the staff has no reason to believe that preclearance would be denied for any proposal to change the line of succession or process for filling vacancies in the mayoralty. 6. Line of Mayoral Succession The Commission may wish to consider whether the Public Advocate should remain the interim successor to the Mayor. In addition to an analysis below of the office of Public Advocate as first in the line of succession, the following alternatives are also discussed: the Comptroller, the Speaker of the Council, a newly created Vice Mayor, and a Deputy Mayor.  26   Public Advocate The Public Advocate is currently the immediate successor to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. Charter  10(b). 12  The most significant power of the office is that of  an ombudsperson, i.e., an officer that monitors government operations and investigates complaints. See Charter  24. Though the Public Advocate maintains a seat on a limited number of boards, the office performs virtually no executive functions other than managing a small staff. As the prior discussion of the history of the office indicates, the powers and responsibilities of the Public Advocate are not of the magnitude of those exercised formerly by the Council President on the Board of Estimate. This analysis can lead to the conclusion, as it did for the 2001 Commission, that the Public Advocate is not appropriately the first in line to succeed to the mayoralty in the event of a vacancy. 13  It may be argued that, in a time of crisis, the person who  immediately becomes Acting Mayor should be someone who has an intimate knowledge of the daily workings of the executive function performed by the Mayor. Either a Deputy Mayor or arguably the Comptroller would meet this criterion. In fact, it may be argued that the Public Advocate, exercising an ombudsperson function, is particularly unsuited to be first in the line of succession to the City's most important executive office. The ""ombuds"" concept originated in Sweden in the early  1700s; by the 1800s, ""the Swedish Ombudsman had evolved into an administrative body appointed by the Parliament to protect individuals against the excesses of the  12  For a comprehensive description of the office of the Public Advocate, see Mark Green & Laurel Eisner, The Public Advocate for New York City: An Analysis of the Country's Only Elected Ombudsman, 42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 1093 (1998). 13 See Making Our City's Progress Permanent: Report of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, at 112 (Sept. 5, 2001).  27   bureaucracy.""  14  Even today, the accepted definition of ombudsperson is ""a public official  appointed by the legislature to receive and investigate citizen complaints against administrative acts of government."" 15  While the office of the Public Advocate is elective  rather than appointive, its powers under the Charter remain largely within the classic ombudsperson model. Therefore, one could argue that the Public Advocate does not gain the experience necessary to immediately step into the mayoralty, particularly in a time of crisis. Furthermore, the Public Advocate's ombudsperson role may put the office  institutionally at odds with the mayoralty; in the event of succession, this fact may create a blurring of institutional separation of powers. On the other hand, it is significant that the office of the Public Advocate is an elected, Citywide office. One could argue that it is more democratic, even when  considering an office that may be filled for only a relatively short period of time (assuming that a special election will be held), to have the person who is first in the line of succession to be someone who has been elected to public office. Furthermore, considering that the Public Advocate has been chosen by the entire electorate of the City, it may be particularly appropriate for the Public Advocate to be the interim successor for another, elected Citywide office. An alternative between either keeping the Public Advocate as first in line of succession or simply replacing that office with another one could be made along the lines of Charter  10(a), the provision governing mayoral suspension, absence, or temporary inability to discharge powers. Under that section, the Publi c Advocate or the Comptroller, in that order, acts as mayor with certain limited powers until the suspension, absence, or 14 15  Green & Eisner, Public Advocate, at 1104. See the website of the United States Ombudsman Association, at www.usombudsman.org.  28   inability ceases. While so acting, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not appoint or remove from office, and may not exercise any power lawfully delegated by the Mayor to a Deputy Mayor prior to the suspension or inability, or before or after the commencement of the absence. Furthermore, the Public Advocate or Comptroller may not, as a general  matter, sign, approve, or disapprove any local law or resolution until the suspension, absence, or temporary inability has continued for at least nine days. While the Deputy Mayor may be delegated many duties, he or she may not act on local laws or resolutions of the Council, act as a magistrate, or appoint or remove officials. Thus, while the Public Advocate or Comptroller may assume certain functions, the operational functions are retained by a deputy mayor. The advantages of such an approach for the vacancy situation is that would not necessarily involve removing the Public Advocate from the line of succession, and it would be familiar. 16  The disadvantage is that it might result in a tension between the Acting  Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, even if they were officially exercising different powers. Comptroller The Comptroller performs several significant functions and is responsible for the fiscal integrity of the City. The Charter vests the Comptroller with the power to audit all City agencies and all matters relating to the City's finances, and to settle and adjust all claims against the City. Furthermore, under Charter  8(c), the Comptroller participates in the issuance of City debt. Furthermore, the Comptroller is responsible for the registration of contracts for the procurement of goods, services and construction. Hence, the  Comptroller, unlike the Public Advocate, exercises certain functions that may be viewed as 16  If the Commission wanted to cons ider this bifurcated approach, it could consider either the Comptroller or the Public Advocate as the Acting Mayor.  29   ""executive"" in nature. Conversely, the responsibility to audit and monitor the executive branch may put the Comptroller institutionally at odds with the executive branch on various issues. This could create, at a minimum, an awkwardness in how the Comptroller, as Acting Mayor, would act in relation to the Comptroller's office. Furthermore, as the  Comptroller's responsibilities are largely post-action audits and approvals, and not service delivery or the implementation of legislative mandates, some might see the Comptroller's executive experience as limited. Speaker of the Council The Speaker of the City Council is the leader of the City Council, and is elected by its members. The Speaker does not possess an executive function and is not a Citywide elected official but, as the leader of the City's legislative body, is a powerful player in the affairs of the City. This role co uld give the Speaker the experience necessary to exercise the powers and duties of the Mayor until there is an election to fill the remainder of the unexpired mayoral term. On the other hand, the Charter, like the State and federal  constitutions, contains a framework based on a separation of powers, which could be compromised by allowing the Speaker to succeed to the mayoralty. The Charter's  separation of powers is manifested in a number of ways that would be compromised if the Speaker became the Acting Mayor. For example, the Mayor provides a check on the Council by approving or vetoing local laws passed by the Council. Conversely, the Council has an oversight role in relation to the activities of mayoral agencies. If the Speaker  succeeded to the mayo ralty, even on an interim basis, these checks could be lost. A possible variation on the idea of Speaker as first in the line of succession is to have a person chosen by the Council be the interim successor. This is currently the third  30   possibility for succession under Charter  10(b), which is the provision governing the order of succession in the event of a mayoral vacancy. Vice Mayor As discussed above, the 1989 Charter Revision Commission considered establishing an office of the Vice Mayor, who would be elected along with the Mayor. Creating the office would represent a significant alteration of the City's electoral structure, with possible legal consequences, and would require framing the specific powers and duties of that office. Deputy Mayor The Charter provides that the Mayor may appoint Deputy Mayors, as appropriate, with powers and duties as the Mayor determines. Of the various existing options for who should be the interim successor, a Deputy Mayor is most likely to subscribe to the views of the vacating Mayor and would be the person most likely to continue the Mayor's policies. In addition, a Deputy Mayor would be intimately familiar with the operation of City government and the role played by the executive branch, an asset that would be cri tical in a period of crisis and transition. A vacancy in the office of Mayor would inevitably create the possibility of significant volatility in the City. It would therefore be valuable to guarantee that someone with knowledge of the City's operations, such as a Deputy Mayor, become the Acting Mayor to ensure and facilitate stability in the City. Furthermore, if an act of war, natural disaster or other disaster in the City claimed the life of the Mayor, the need for stability and experienced leadership would be essential. The tragic events of September 11th have demonstrated the need for continuity in a time of grave crisis. As is widely known, Mayor Giuliani was able to develop a  31   comprehensive emergency response plan immediately after the attack. The execution of that plan was possible because the Mayor had extensive knowledge of the operation of City government and a close working relationship with the City officials responsible for executing the emergency response plan. It is arguable that, had there been a vacancy in the mayoralty related to the sudden attacks, a Deputy Mayor would have been best able to replicate the Mayor's knowledge and working relationships. Additionally, someone who is already in the chain of command to the Mayor, such as a Deputy Mayor, would likely be one of the only persons who could effectively command and deploy police, fire, and other resources necessary to respond in a time of crisis. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fact that a Deputy Mayor is not an ele cted official makes a Deputy Mayor inappropriate to become the interim mayoral successor. In addition to the general democracy concerns that would be raised, making a Deputy Mayor the interim successor could be perceived as giving him or her an unfair advantage in any election to fill out the remainder of the term, assuming that the Deputy Mayor were inclined to run in such an election. Therefore, if the Commission were to consider proposing that a Deputy Mayor be first in the line of succession, it might want to consider barring that person from running in such an election to fill the unexpired term. Furthermore, the concerns about the Deputy Mayor being Acting Mayor become more significant the longer the period of time for which he or she would serve as Acting Mayor. Therefore, if the Commission decides to consider proposing a change to Deputy Mayor in the line of succession, it needs to consider closely the amount of time before an election is held.  32   Summary of Charter Revision Options on Mayoral Succession As stated, the issue of ""mayoral succession"" really consists of two major issues: who should serve as the Acting Mayor when a vacancy first occurs, and how, if at all, elections should be scheduled to choose the person or persons who will complete the remainder of the term. Using the list of policy considerations listed in the Introduction as a guide, the following is a summary of the possible issues and options, many of which were discussed above. Line of Succession  Issue: Who should be the firs t in the line of succession? Options: Public Advocate, Comptroller, Council Speaker, Vice Mayor, Deputy Mayor.    Issue: Who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession? Options: There are many permutations of who should be the next person(s) in the line of succession.  Term of Acting Mayor  Issue: If the Commission proposes not to keep the portion of the current system relating to elections, whether or not it removes the Public Advocate's office from the line of succession, should the Acting Mayor serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a special election be held for someone to succeed the Acting Mayor? Options: The approach set forth in the General City Law is that the successor becomes the Mayor for the remainder of the term. In the current succession provision, a general election is held to choose someone to fill out the term. The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a special election. The current Charter approach was considered for mayoral vacancies by the 1999 Commission.  33   Special Elections: Partisan or Nonpartisan  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices (Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, and Council member) provide for a nonpartisan special election. The alternative, of course, is to provide for partisan elections.  Timing of Special Elections  Issue: If a special election is provided for, wha t should the timing of that election be (i.e., 45, 60, 90, or 120 days after the vacancy)? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide generally for a special election after 45 days from the vacancy. Experience throughout the country varies. Considerations include the identity of the office of the interim successor and the amount of time the public would need to educate itself about the candidates.  Special Elections: Runoff Provision  Issue: If a special election is provided for, should a runoff election be held if the winner of that election does not get a high enough percentage of the vote? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices do not provide for a runoff, although one was proposed by the 1999 Commission.    Issue: If a runoff election is provided for, what should the trigger percentage be and how many candidates would qualify for the runoff? Options: The 1999 Commission proposed a trigger of 40 percent, with the top two candidates advancing to the runoff. Other choices (such as a trigger of 25 percent or three candidates advancing) are, of course, possible. These permutations must be analyzed in light of voting rights implications.  34   Need for General Election  Issue: Does the person elected at a special election serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, or should a general election be held following the special election? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide, in the usual case, for a general election to fill the remainder of the term.  General Election: Partisan or Nonpartisan  Issue: If such a general election is held, should it be partisan or nonpartisan? Options: The Charter's current vacancy provisions for other City offices provide for a partisan general election. The Commission's deliberations on the issue of nonpartisan elections in general may be relevant to a determination on this question.  Special Considerations  Issue: What is the proper relationship between the choice of the person who will serve as the Acting Mayor and the choices about the election system? For example, if a Deputy Mayor would be Acting Mayor, should a special election be held more or less quickly than if it were, for example, the Public Advocate? Options: If the choice for which office the Acting Mayor comes from is considered by the Commission the correct one on the whole, but one that has some drawback, the Commission might propose to shorten the time until the special election, for example, in order to address the issue.  Upon direction of the Commission, the staff will draft Charter language reflecting its choices, or possible choices, on these issues.  35    APPENDIX A  SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED BY 1999 CHARTER REVISION COMMISSION REGARDING MAYORAL SUCCESSION    Summary of Comments of Elected Officials Regarding Mayoral Succession  CITY ELECTED OFFICIALS Public Advocate Mark Green (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 16) Believes that the special election proposal would repudiate the precedent of five Charter revision commissions retaining the current system of succession and would risk a disruptive series of campaigns and transitions. Opposes the special election provision and urges that the Commission withdraw its proposals. (August 26, 1999: Transcript p. 4) Opposes special election provision and believes it is wrong to change the rules midterm. Comptroller Alan Hevesi (Written Testimony Submitted August 12, 1999) Supports special elections. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 29) Believes that the mayoral line of succession should be clarified. The Speaker proposes that after the 2001 election, a Vice Mayor position be created. The Vice Mayor would serve as the Mayor's successor, be electe d in a general election with the Mayor and hold office for the same term.  A-1   Queens Borough President Claire Shulman (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 8) Supports the idea of a Vice-Mayor. Supports special election proposal. Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 4) Supports the special election proposal because it gives the citizens of New York the power to vote on whom they want to succeed the mayor. Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer (August 26, 1999: Transcript p. 31) Proposes delaying special election proposal until the next election cycle. Council Member Noach Dear (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 27) Supports the proposal that election be held within 60 days should the Mayor's office be vacated during his or her term. Council Member Stephen Dibrienza (August 5, 1999: Transcript p.66) Criticizes the fact that the special election proposal would go into effect immediately. Council Member June Eisland (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 5) With respect to succession, nothing should be done until after the 2001 election. Council Member Stephen Fiala (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 11) Supports proposal to hold a special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, because it would bring mayoralty into line with all the other City elected offices. Supports the abolition the Office of Public Advocate. He would like to make the first deputy mayor or a vice- mayor next in the line of succession, then have a special election in 60 days.  A-2   Council Member Kenneth Fisher (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 48) Believes there would be too many elections and/or Mayors in one year under the proposed scenario. (One Mayor ends in December, another from January to February; an election in March then in November.) Council Member Katherine Freed (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 68) Criticizes the special election proposal because she believes that it would change the rules in the middle of the game. Council Member Martin Golden (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 23) When a vacancy occurs, the voters should determine person the best qualified to fill the vacant office. Therefore, he believes that the Charter should be revised to provide that a special election be held within 60 days to fill any vacancy that may occur in the office of the Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President and members of the City Council. Council Member Stanley Michels (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 20) Believes that special elections have historically produced low turnouts. The Mayor should not be elected with a low turnout. The Public Advocate is elected on a citywide basis. He has popular support and people are aware that he is the person next in line to become Mayor. Council Member James Oddo: (August 9, 1999: Transcript p.2 0) Supports the special election proposal. He also supports the abolition of the Office of the Public Advocate. Council Member Angel Rodriguez (August 11, 1999: Transcript p.114) Opposes changes to the succession rules.  A-3   Council Member Archie Spigner (August 5, 1999: Transcript p. 79) Succession should not be changed. Council Member Larry Warden (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 31) States that the Public Advocate or the President of the City Council has been in the line of succession for 168 years. Council Member Priscilla Wooten (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 37)) Supports the special election in the event of a mayoral vacancy.  STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS Senator Vincent Gentile (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 23) Opposes any changes proposed by this Charter Commission. Senator Carl Kruger (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 61) Recommends that the Office of the Public Advocate be enhanced. Senator Guy Velella (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 50) Supports a special election to fill mayoral vacancy. Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz (August 10, 1999: Transcript p. 25) Believes that mayoral succession, if approved, should apply only in the next election cycle. Assembly Member Herman Farrell (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 27) Any action taken by the Commission should be delayed until the 2001 election cycle.  A-4   Assembly Member Joan Millman (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 42) Opposes the special election proposal. Assembly Member John Ravitz (August 12, 1999: Transcript p. 7) Supports C ommission's decision not to change the line of mayoral succession. Supports the special election proposal. Assembly Member Scott Stringer (August 11, 1999: Transcript p. 53) Believes sixty days after a mayoral vacancy occurs is not enough time for an election. Believes that the role of the Office of the Public Advocate should be strengthened.  FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS  Congressman Vito Fosella (August 9, 1999: Transcript p. 34) (Testimony read into the record by Sherry Diamond) Supports the special election proposal.  A-5   Summary of Comments Regarding Mayoral Succession Received During August 6, 1999 Expert Panel  Lawrence Mandelker - Kantor, Wolf, Mandelker & Cass (Represented various elected officials during campaigns over the past 30 years, inc luding Mayors Edward Koch and Rudolph Giuliani; was a Law Chairman for the New York City Democratic Party and as of 1999 represented the New York State Republican Committee) He believes that the issue of mayoral succession should be deferred until the vote rs have determined whether they want vacancies to be filled for a period of 60 days to be followed by a special election. If vacancies could be filled in 60 days rather than as long as 15 months, having a citywide official become interim mayor would not be a concern. (Transcript p. 89). The Public Advocate incorrectly claimed that he was nominated and elected in 1997, because, among other things, the voters considered him to be the better person to succeed the mayor in the case of a vacancy. (Id.). He supports the idea of filling a vacancy in the office of the Mayor by special election. (Transcript pp. 89, 108).  A-6   Summary of Public Proposals Regarding Mayoral Succession Received by the 1999 Commission  The 1999 Commission received many public comments between June 30, 1999 and August 31, 1999. Many of the letters and e-mail received contained general issues for investigation by the Commission as well as substantive proposals for Charter revision. All public proposals were reviewed and considered by t he Commission. summarized as follows: They are   The line of mayoral succession should be changed, but not be effective immediately.  A Mayor who is unable to serve his or her full term should be succeeded by another elected official from the same politi cal party.   An office of Vice-Mayor should be created, and should succeed to the mayoralty.  The will of the people, as shown in an election, should be continued through to the end of the term. This could be implemented by having the First Deputy Mayor as first in line for mayoral succession.  A-7    APPENDIX B  SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED BY 2001 CHARTER REVISION COMMISSION REGARDING MAYORAL SUCCESSION    Summary of Comments of Elected Officials Regarding Mayoral Succession  Council Member and Speaker Peter Vallone (By written submission dated August 15, 2001) Proposes that the position of ""Vice Mayor"" be created. States that with this proposal, the Vice Mayor would run in both the general and primary elections on a ticket with the Mayor and would be elected at the primary and general elections jointly with the Mayor by the casting by each elector of a single vote applicable to both offices. The persons having the highest number of votes cast jointly for them for Mayor and Vice-Mayor respectively would be elected. States that the Vice-Mayor would be the assistant chief executive office of the City with such duties and powers as delegated by the Mayor. The Vice Mayor would preside over meetings and would succeed to the Office of the Mayor in case of an emergency. The proposed local law would become effective for the November, 2005 election and every election thereafter.  B-1   Summary of Public Proposals Regarding Mayoral Succession Received by the 2001 Charter Revision Commission  The Commission received many public comments between from the time the Commission was appointed on June 15, 2001, to the time the Commission voted on the proposals on August 24, 2001. Indeed, the Commission received many letters  containing general issues for investigation by the Commission, in addition to substantive proposals for Charter revision. All public proposals were reviewed and considered by the Commission.     The Public Advocate's office should be removed from the line of succession. The Public Advocate's office should be eliminated. A position of Vice-Mayor should be created within the Charter. There is a need for continuity of executive policy when a vacancy arises that the Public Advocate cannot provide.

GX010-62-14878469	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development           Consolidated Plan Contact    CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   The City of Roseville, in southeastern Michigan, Macomb County, is located north of the City of Detroit.  The City is a suburban community which has developed primarily between the Gratiot Avenue and Groesbeck Avenue corridors within the County .  Action Plan   The City of Roseville will be receiving $560,000 for the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Entitlement Program during the federal fiscal year 1996.  In addition the City expects to earn an additional $100,000 in program income from previously funded projects.  The projects planned to be funded by these funds include: single family housing rehabilitation, public services, public facilities and improvements, planning and administration.  Citizen Participation   The Roseville City Council has delegated the oversight of the Community Development Block Grant Program to the Citizen Advisory Committee(CAC).  The CAC meets with City staff to prepare the CDBG budget, review the annual  Grantee Performance Report(GPR), grant waivers of the dollar limits to the rehab program, and to provide input and guidance to the overall CDBG program. Two public hearings were held in the process of developing the 1996 Action Plan.  They were held on March 5, and April 23, 1996.  At the suggestion of a resident the Neighborhood Watch System was added as a project in CDBG eligible areas.  No other input was received at the public hearings.    COMMUNITY PROFILE   The City of Roseville was incorporated on April 1, 1957 during the height of the  expansion years of the City of Detroit's suburbs.  However, the community began developing 150 years earlier, evidenced by scattered farmhouses still remaining throughout the city.  Suburbanization of the rural community began at the turn of the century due to the interurban streetcar line on Gratiot Avenue which extended north to Port Huron and south to the City of Detroit.  The City of Roseville's largest escalation in population occurred in the post war era of the  1950's through 1960's.  The City's current population, according to the 1990 US Census, is 51,412.  This is a decrease of 5% from the 1980 populations total.  This loss differs from the continued growth experience in Macomb County.  The County has continued to grow due to its expansive territory remaining open to development.  Although Roseville's population has slightly declined, the number of households in the city increased from 16,453 households in 1970 to 19,537 in 1990.  This  increase resulted from the trend of households becoming smaller, that is, fewer persons per household.  Thus smaller family size reduces the population but not the need for additional housing units.  The most significant change in Roseville's population has been the increase in  the number of elderly persons.  The number of persons over the age of 65 increased by 2,731 persons, for a total of 7,028 persons above the age of 65.  In 1980 the percentage of persons above age 65 was 7.9% of the total population.  In 1990 that percentage had risen to 13.7%.  The rise in the number of elderly has increased the median age in the city to 28.1 years, up from 23.2 years recorded in 1970.  Overall, 12.6 percent of all households in Roseville were headed by single women, an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous decade.  The racial composition, by percent of population, did not change during the 1980's.  One percent of the population was African American in 1990, unchanged from the 1 percent recorded in 1980.  The actual number of persons however, decreased by 108 persons from 621 in 1980 to 513 persons in 1990.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   As the City ages so does the population and housing stock.  As the growth of the outlying areas of Macomb County continues, it is assumed that families with sufficient income will continue to leave the older housing stock of inner ring suburbs in favor of new housing to the north.  In-migration of lower income elderly and female headed households poses new housing requirements for the City of Roseville.  The need for housing assistance programs continues to grow with this shift in population.  Housing Needs   Housing needs are determined by focusing on what is lacking in the housing inventory for certain household types.  ""Need"" implies desire for housing which may be beyond the income or housing quality limitations of certain households in the community.  Households and families in Roseville with the ""worst case"" needs are:    unassisted very low income renter households who pay more than half their income for rent;  persons living in seriously substandard housing;  those who have been involuntarily displaced from their current housing.    According to the 1990 Census, forty-four percent of all renter households in Roseville, have earnings less than $20,000, within  the  threshold for very low income households.  These households also experience the greatest extent of cost burden, with 61 percent paying more than 30 percent of household income on housing costs.  Households with earnings between $20,000 and $29,999, which would be considered ""low"" but not ""very low"" income, constitute another 31 percent of the total share of renter occupied households.   Eighty-three percent of very low income renter households in Roseville are cost- burdened, with 1,199 renter households paying more than 50% of their income for housing costs.     Seventy-five percent of Roseville's  occupied housing units are homeowners.  The number of low income owners is low due to the greater number of owners in the higher income categories.  However, the number of ""low"" income homeowner households ($20,000 - $29,999) is far greater than the same income group of renters.  Eighty-five percent of very low income owner households are cost burdened, with 1,537 owners paying more than 54% of their income for housing costs.  Housing Market Conditions   The 1990 Census reports a total of 20,025 units in Roseville's housing stock.  Ninety-five percent of all available useable land has been developed for urban uses.  Thus the extensive growth of housing without clearance is limited.   Home ownership in Roseville is substantial with 14,571 owner occupied units in 1990, or 74.6 percent of the total units.    Due to the construction of several large apartment complexes in the past decade, renter occupied units in the city have increased.  In 1990, 4,966 renter occupied units represented 25.4 percent of all occupied units.  This is an increase of 1,220 renter units over the 1980 total.    Affordable Housing Needs   The age of the housing stock in the City of Roseville contributes to a high amount of substandard housing in the City.  This will require continued efforts  to provide housing rehabilitation assistance programs.  Very low income homeowners and renters both have been shown to be cost burdened with respect to housing.  Both groups need rehabilitation assistance programs to maintain their units, as well as to increase the supply of affordable owner and renter housing.   The high percentage of elderly households in the City, and the fact that the elderly population continues to grow, indicates the need for increased affordable housing for the elderly, both in terms of rehabilitation assistance and in the maintenance of affordable rental senior housing.   Homeless Needs   At a press conference on May 2, 1996, the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter(MCES) reported 3,939 homeless sheltered in Macomb County during 1994.  The two main shelters serving Roseville and Macomb County are Turning Point located in Mount Clemens, and MATTS located in Warren.  In 1994, Turning Point counted 13,212 beds occupied at night and MATTS counted 8,584 for the same period.  Eight percent of those that were served by these two shelters listed Roseville  as their last known place of residence.  MCES was appointed by the Macomb County Board of Commissioners in 1990 to study the needs and identify the barriers that exist and contribute to homelessness.  The results of the committee's study was published in 1991 titled, ""More Than a Bed for the Night.""  In the report, researchers concluded that the principal causes for homelessness in the County were lack of affordable housing, and extreme poverty.  Many root causes were further identified: the failure of appropriate job training to prepare low income persons for jobs in today's market; and the physical condition of housing which is affordable to the very lowest income population.  Other principal reasons for homelessness were: eviction due to lack of income, problems with relatives, substance abuse, elimination of State funding and General Assistance Programs, and a shift away from manufacturing employment in the Metro Detroit area.  The lack of transportation continues to be an important factor in promoting homelessness in the County.  Recently the voters in the County passed a millage initiative which creates funding for the Southeastern Michigan Area Transportation(SMART) bus system.  This system will give access the service job employment centers to those previously without transportation.  Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The City of Roseville Housing Commission administers 172 Section 8 certificates and 132 Section 8 vouchers.  Priorities for issuing these certificates include: housing assistance to the elderly and small families.  Female headed households have received approximately 75 percent of the City's Section 8 housing  vouchers and certificates and 60 percent of the rehabilitation program's assisted  projects.   The Roseville Housing Commission also managers 103 senior citizen public housing units at the Lawn Street apartments and 134 units at the Eastland Street apartments.  The Commission works with twenty-five apartment complexes, seven townhouse developments, and ninety-two private landlords and management companies to place residents in qualified housing in the Roseville area.  The waiting period on the Housing Commission's waiting lists for these certificates and vouchers is currently running about two years.   Barriers to Affordable Housing   No known relevant public policies exist which would impede or affect the production of affordable housing units in the City of Roseville.  Traditionally Zoning Ordinances are seen as a regulatory barrier when new uses of land, which would prove to be more affordable to very low income households, are restricted.  No recent instances of such restrictions are recorded in the City of  Roseville.  The zoning codes are used to promote compatible land uses within the City.  Fair Housing   Although little evidence of discriminatory actions exist in the City of Roseville which would prevent fair housing practices, the City continues to asses all barriers to fair housing and promotes programs which are targeted to assist persons with special needs, including those who federal preferences.  The City  fosters anti-discrimination practices, advocates housing alternatives for very low-income persons and encourages programs which assist first-time home buyers.  Lead-Based Paint   The City of Roseville Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program monitors lead based paint hazards under its housing rehabilitation project.  Educational information is provided to each homeowner with regard to lead based paint issues, safety of children, and reduction of exposure to pealing or chipping paint.  Other Issues   The needs of homeless, adult disabled, female headed households, and persons who are HIV infected are being considered through a network of care providers who have formed the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter.  This organization was established for the purpose of examining trends, data collection, and reporting on work being done on a Macomb County basis.  Staff  from the Roseville CDBG program attends the meetings of the Coalition.  Through the Coalition the City has the resources to direct persons needing assistance for housing, substance abuse counseling, health care, job training, youth services, and other special needs.  Community Development Needs   The City of Roseville community development needs can be summarized as follows:    Housing rehabilitation and Home ownership assistance programs to provide affordable housing and improve housing opportunities for low and very low income households.   Public service programs to meet the social, economic, health, and quality life needs of low income persons, especially those who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.   Public improvement projects to improve low income neighborhoods and the facilities serving low income residents of these areas.    Coordination   The City of Roseville will work closely with neighboring jurisdictions and the county departments and agencies to provide an area wide solution to housing and community development issues.  City staff will continue to meet with other members of the Macomb Coalition for Emergency Shelter, and with service providers to work through a coordinated approach to solving the areas identified needs.    HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Vision for Change   The strategy for change developed by the City of Roseville includes assessments of the City's housing and homeless needs, public facilities, infrastructure improvements, public services, accessibility, and planning needs.   Housing and Community Development Objectives and Priorities   The strategy for change has been developed in consultation with citizens and local organizations in order to coordinate resources and address the national goals of the Community Development Block Grant(CDBG) Program.  They are:    Preserve, improve and expand the stock or affordable housing in the City of Roseville    Ensure that affordable rental housing is available for very-low and low income elderly, handicapped and family households   Develop assistance programs for homeless individuals and families and those who are at risk of becoming homeless   Maintain and expand the supportive services of persons in need    Promote Fair Housing Opportunities for all persons    Facilitate public/private initiatives to improve the residential quality of Roseville neighborhoods   Identify and reduce barriers to the development of affordable housing.    Housing Priorities   The City of Roseville has set housing priorities to upgrade the existing housing stock through the residential housing rehabilitation program, to assist in the development of affordable housing alternatives for low income owners and renters, to increase the supply of housing for the elderly and those with special needs.   Non-Housing Community Development Priorities   The City through its participation with a network of service providers will continue to provide economic, health and social assistance to those in need within the community by targeting federal funds for this purpose.  Anti-Poverty Strategy   The City of Roseville will continue to utilize federal resources to operate programs which will enable low and very low income households to remain in their homes and to keep these homes in decent, safe, and sanitary condition, while enabling these households to us their limited resources for expenses such as food and clothing.  The City will network with other jurisdictions and area housing and social service providers to carry out anti-poverty strategies, including education, and self sufficiency programs.  Housing and Community Development Resources   The City of Roseville will utilize CDBG entitlement funding which it receives fro the U S Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) to carry out its housing and community development program.  In addition the City also receives funds annually as income from its previously funded housing projects.   Coordination of Strategic Plan   The City will coordinate with other housing and service providers in the county in the planning and implementation of its housing and community development strategy.

A model of ""transit-based development,""  the Fruitvale Transit Village offers a unique approach to revitalizing  this predominantly Hispanic and increasingly Asian low-income community.     Since the factories and canneries that employed local residents began  moving out in the 1960's, the commercial strip along East 14th Street in  East Oakland has been in decline. A local clothing store that used to employ  21 people now employs four. In 1989 when BART announced it was going to  build a 500-car parking garage at its Fruitvale station, local residents,  who believed the garage would serve as a barrier to their neighborhood  and foster further economic and environmental decline, intervened.     Primarily through the work of Arabella Martinez, executive director  of the Spanish Speaking Unity Council, the concept of the Transit Village  was born. The concept is simple: link a local community's economy to mass  transit, thereby discouraging transportation by car, increasing pedestrian  and bicycle traffic and revitalizing the neighborhood.     Local community members participated in developing the Transit Village  plan, and their concerns have been incorporated into the design, providing  the critical aspect of community stewardship. ""This is not the usual planning  process,"" says Martinez, ""It came from the community and the people that  live here. That's new.""     The Transit Village will include a state-of-the-art child development/health  care facility, a senior center, a library, a community police station,  family and senior citizen housing and new and renovated retail office space.  These facilities will be connected through a Pedestrian Plaza to the Fruitvale  BART station.     The project is begin developed by a nonprofit community development  corporation whole purpose is to revitalize the neighborhood physically,  economically and socially while pursuing environmentally sound practices.               Program Highlights      Natural Resource Conservation         The project site -- currently a physically deteriorated and marginal business  sector containing parking lots and a four-lane arterial roadway -- will  be transformed to increase mass transit usage, to encourage bicycling and  walking, and to provide open space.        High density development will reduce regional waste production.        Toxic wastes on site will be cleaned up during development.       Economic Progress         Each component of the project will be financially self-sufficient.        Tenants in the new development, such as La Clinica de la Raza and the De  Colores child care center, have sufficient income to cover both the costs  of operation and debt service.        Retail stores under development will create 500 jobs.        Employment training conducted in the area will teach the skills that the  new businesses will demand, providing local community residents access  to the new jobs.        The new construction and job creation will generate income for many low-income  residents.        Increased sales revenue will help small businesses in the area.        Affordable housing will be more available to low- and moderate-income household  and senior citizens.         Human Development      Limited or non-English speaking residents will benefit from the health  and human service agencies that will be located in the area, providing  a multi-lingual and multi-cultural staff. Similar agencies in the city  do not provide this service.        The expanded La Clinica de la Raza will be able to increase the number  of patient/staff interactions by more than 50,000 per year, serving a total  of 8,000 to 20,000 individuals. Currently, La Clinica has a monthly waiting  list of more than 300 patients. Its dental clinic has a two-year waiting  list.        The community will be involved in the development, helping to generate  a sense of neighborhood stewardship.              Vital Statistics      Program  Management/Partnerships:  The Spanish Speaking Unity Council manages  the project and has entered into partnerships with La Clinica de la Raza,  merchants and residents of the area, the City of Oakland, Bay Area Rapid  Transit (BART), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, A.C. Transit  and16 community groups including the Fruitvale Community Development Council  and the Fruitval Community Collaborative. Brady & Associates and Baker/Vilar  are developing and conducting community design programs.     Budget:   $25 to $50 million projected total project cost.     Community  Served:  The racially and culturally diverse population of Fruitvale  Community and the City of Oakland (combined population of 423,000).     Measures  of Success (Projected):              The project will strengthen the link between transit planning and community  planning, including land use policies and urban design.        The project will generate 500 - 1,000 community jobs.        The project will include housing for seniors, a multi-purpose senior center,  a child development center and a pedistrian plaza.        The project will generate 11,300 daily transit riders.        $15 million has already been raised with $8.8 million in funding pending.                                                 Back to Top                                                                  HOME     |  EERE  |  SEARCH"

Burns $138,073  Fast Facts  The proposed FY 2001 operating budget is $138,073,000, an increase of $2,541,000 over the FY 2000 budget. The agency net increase is largely due to implementation of Metrorail's late night closing on the weekends (at 2 a.m.) and enhanced bus service in the District.  During FY 2001, WMATA will launch new marketing initiatives to better inform residents regarding WMATA services and programs.    FY 2001 Proposed Budget by Control Center The basic unit of budgetary and financial control in the District's financial management system is a control center. The Washington Area Transit Authority is comprised of one control center that serves as the major component of the agency's budget.

A Board of Directors with representatives from each of the three jurisdictions governs the affairs of WMATA. WMATA's responsibilities include operation and administration of the system, the establishment of recommended fares, and the determination of funding from various sources, including the share of subsidy from each of the participating jurisdictions. The Office of Mass Transit (OMT) in the Department of Public Works (DPW) is the District's liaison office with WMATA. OMT continuously monitors and evaluates the provision of Metrobus, Metrorail and MetroAccess paratransit service in the District by WMATA. OMT also prepares the annual budgets, and processes the quarterly payments, for the District's subsidy to WMATA. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, created effective February 20, 1967, is an interstate compact agency and, by the terms of its enabling legislation, is an agency and instrumentality of the District of Columbia, State of Maryland, and Commonwealth of Virginia. This agency was created by the aforementioned states and the District of Columbia to plan, finance, construct and operate a comprehensive mass transit system for the Washington Metropolitan Area.

In the course of doing so, they have made preservation one of the most effective tools for revitalizing communities of all kinds and sizes.""   -- Richard Moe, President of the National Trust for Historic Preservation   Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl (Henry Holt, 1997)      Back to top   Introduction   Go to the heart of any thriving community and you will discover the special place reserved there for historic resources and for the public transportation that enhances access to them. During the past two decades, Americans have rediscovered and embraced the historic elements of their cities and neighborhoods, and in recent years have shifted the focus of conservation efforts from individually important buildings and districts to the traditional forms, transportation choices, and street designs that make city centers and residential areas walkable and workable for businesses and residents. Cities and towns that have replenished and revitalized critical public transportation links in their downtowns and nearby neighborhoods are also extending their efforts to work with regional agencies and adjacent communities to capture the benefits of public transportation and preserve historic urban designs throughout metropolitan areas.   What factors have contributed to this urban revolution -- a revolution in the less-frequently used sense of the word, a ""return to center""? And how can we -- preservationists, local elected and appointed officials, transportation professionals, planners, and others interested in the health and well being of communities -- make the most of our existing historic resources to improve transportation options and livability in the widest possible range of places, from small towns to suburban centers to major cities?   The study that resulted in this book was initiated in September 2001 to examine how decisions about public transportation, land development and redevelopment, and historic preservation have complemented one another in dozens of communities nationwide. The goal of the study was to demonstrate how transit and historic preservation act as compatible forces to revitalize communities. We set out to illuminate the many ways in which communities of all sizes have restored their urban or suburban cores and made full use of those centers' capacities to help metropolitan areas grow sustainably. We wanted to find out how historic preservation values are informing community planning for public transit, and how these values are being used in development decisions intended to promote transit use.   In the early stages of our study, we focused on classic rail terminal facilities that had been transformed into intermodal centers to facilitate movement in and among modes of transportation. An important initial question was whether these splendidly restored monuments to the golden age of rail passenger service were serving again as vital hubs in multimodal transportation systems, and whether their revitalization was contributing to economic development activities nearby. We drew on the work of the Great American Station Foundation (GASF), which has documented economic revitalization near historic train stations. In collaboration with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the GASF reported on its work in  Rail Stations: At the Heart of America's Communities , showcasing numerous examples of station restorations that benefited from strong local leadership in the service of reviving passenger rail and revitalizing communities through historic preservation.   We found abundant evidence that historic rail stations have an important role in community planning for public transit. Reuse of these stations can greatly boost the economic development needed to sustain transit and attract new riders. Our findings led us to extend the scope of our inquiry into other important aspects of the relationships among transit, historic preservation, and economic development. Much could be learned, for example, from exploring the influence of public transportation on historic growth and development patterns. We were curious about the large stock of historic commercial buildings that typically exist in downtowns, particularly those once served by rail: the factories, warehouses, and large-scale retail stores of previous centuries. We wanted to understand how these buildings served and were served by the local transit systems, and the impact of these historic resources on the character of contemporary central business districts.   We also took a cue from several major cities, including Denver, San Diego, and St. Louis, and examined the historic neighborhoods immediately adjacent to downtowns. In the vicinity of San Francisco, Cleveland, and Chicago, among many other major cities, are suburban villages that flourished historically because of access to the urban core provided by public transit in its golden age. We found that we needed to examine how downtowns and these nearby communities integrated contemporary transportation developments that accommodate automobiles, especially parking facilities, in ways that would support rather than undermine community preservation and transit-oriented development. We also needed to examine the ways in which downtown revitalization and historic preservation are and should be integrated into regional approaches to improving transit and local economic development.   Federal leadership in the past two decades has stimulated the kind of transit-oriented revitalization this report showcases. In particular, two Federal programs -- the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and the Transportation Enhancements provision contained in Federal surface transportation law -- have provided communities with funding and other support to restore their historic rail stations and renew their downtowns.   NEW GOLDEN AGE FOR RAIL STATIONS   Northeast Corridor Improvement Project   Substantially completed by the mid-1980s, the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project was authorized in the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. The project endowed Amtrak with the capability to operate fast, reliable, comfortable, and economically sound rail passenger service in the Northeast Corridor from Washington to Boston, while restoring landmark passenger stations in this corridor to their former glory.   Many of these architectural masterpieces, including Daniel Burnham's Washington Union Station and H.H. Richardson's New London Union Station, are on the National Register of Historic Places. These and other stations, including Boston South Station and Newark Pennsylvania Station, have since become important hubs in regional and metropolitan public transportation systems and are contributing to nearby economic development.   Much of Boston South Station's magnificent curving facade and a portion of the original main waiting room were saved from the wrecking ball after being placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The station is now the indispensable core of a multimodal transportation network that includes commuter rail, Amtrak, the Boston subway system, intercity bus service, and an underground bus rapid transit system -- the Transitway -- that provides public transit for the major redevelopment effort underway on the South Boston waterfront.   The Federal Transit Administration contributed $450 million to the cost of the two underground bus rapid transit stations adjacent to three key South Boston waterfront destinations: the World Trade Center, the new convention center, and the federal courthouse. The Transitway brings most of this 300-acre development within a quarter mile walk of modern, amenity-rich transit for workers, visitors, and residents.   This extension of center city Boston is among the most ambitious transit-oriented developments in the United States, thanks to dramatic limits on parking, a modernized legal framework for shoreline development, water transit facilities, pedestrian-friendly urban streets lined with retail and other active uses, and large, mixed-use developments balancing housing and office space.   The Northeast Corridor project's historic station restorations included elements that today are considered essential to good transit-oriented development. In addition to refurbishing the significant historic and architectural features of Baltimore Union Station, for example, the corridor project helped finance multimodal access to the station and developed a partnership with the city of Baltimore that produced additional site improvements, including new street lights, sidewalk repairs and reglazing of the station canopy. Commercial and retail space has been added or improved. Partnerships among units of government, transit agencies, and the private sector have enhanced the utility, community attachment, and multimodal dimension of these stations.   Image:  Boston South Station's facade during renovation.    Transportation Enhancements   Congress made the rehabilitation of historic transportation facilities eligible for transportation enhancements funding in 1991 when the program was first created, thus recognizing the value of rail stations and depots to ""enhance the community benefits of transportation investments.""   Transportation enhancements have contributed many millions of federal dollars and stimulated an additional 34 percent from state, local, and private sources for restoration of hundreds of historic rail passenger stations. The federal transportation enhancements provision has also provided funds for improved pedestrian access, landscaping, public art, and nearby streetscape improvements.   Many rail passenger stations whose restoration was supported with enhancement funds are presently functioning as important community and regional intermodal transportation centers. Few are grander or more ambitious, or more focused on the transportation mission than the Los Angeles Union Station Gateway Transit Center. Enhancements funding accounted for $19.6 million of the project's $125 million price tag. Art, architecture, and landscaping help create a comfortable walking environment within this giant multimodal transportation facility that serves regional commuter rail, Amtrak, subway, buses, cars, vanpools, taxis, and pedestrians. The individual's perception of the time and effort spent in walking to and waiting for transit is modified at the transit gateway in ways that are reminiscent of the impact of the historic station's grandeur on rail travelers. Transportation planners see the gateway experience as a means of restoring the notion that downtown Los Angeles is a place for walking.   The expansion of multimodal travel concentrated at the Gateway Transit Center is contributing to economic development in the downtown's north end, where Union Station's 51 acres are being gradually developed by the Catellus Development Corporation, the real estate arm of the Santa Fe Railroad. Both the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Metropolitan Water District purchased sections of the property for their headquarters. Parts of the old Union Station remain undeveloped, and Catellus continues to weigh development opportunities for its station area land. Another developer of office space about a block from the gateway cited proximity to great transit and a great building as one of the drivers for his project.    THE CITY BEYOND THE STATION   Historic rail stations in American communities are once again becoming dynamic gathering places for city transportation services and engines for economic growth. The rebirth of these historic stations is only part of the much larger story of how transit, urban revitalization, and historic preservation are working in concert to bring back our city and town centers. To tell that larger story, we decided to look beyond station redevelopments to the surrounding downtowns, nearby neighborhoods, and transit-oriented suburbs that are served by rail systems and that, in turn, contribute to the economic vibrancy of successful cities.   Much is being written about economic development and community revitalization. Information abounds on efforts to bring back cities, improve transit, and craft new development to encourage transit use. Recognition is growing that historic preservation is a key contributor to community revitalization. Little has been written, however, about how transit, development to support it, community revitalization, and historic preservation inseparably serve common goals and reinforce one another's successes. Our case examples weave these themes together and also address them individually. We have relied on the published work of transit and development professionals, community revitalization advocates, and the principal proponents of the historic preservation-community revitalization nexus, as well as the observations of practitioners in the field.   Working from these sources, we can demonstrate that public transit strengthens community revitalization, especially in urban cores; and that an economically and socially resurgent urban core is key to successful public transit. Historic preservation contributes directly to transit success by contributing directly to urban development. A closely related thesis suggests that restoring the centripetal power of a city's downtown is a sustainable way for a metropolitan area to grow more wisely. Historic structures and historic development patterns contribute to the success of public transit and, along with transit, contribute to the urban renaissance.   In addition to recycling old and historic buildings and returning them to productive economic use, cities are reclaiming environmentally degraded industrial sites for reuse as agents of urban revitalization and contributors to redevelopment. The physical relationship of these reclaimed brownfields to public transit adds to their value. The Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, in a collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, produced an informative and useful study of urban land reclamation in 2001 entitled  Redeveloping Brownfields with Federal Transportation Funds .   The more transit and adjacent development contribute to community revitalization, the greater the chance of success in achieving other goals, such as providing more travel choices, easing traffic congestion, lessening dependence on autos for virtually every trip, contributing to healthy air, providing affordable housing and the opportunity for wealth accumulation for working families, preserving open space and farm land, and improving the quality of life for Americans.    THE STUDY PROCESS   At the outset of the study, we organized a day-long symposium, attended by professionals in preservation, transportation, and development from both the public and private sectors. The group examined the characteristics of successful development adjacent to or in relation to public transit stations. Participants suggested places where historic resources were contributing to making the phenomenon work. A literature review was conducted after the symposium to discover written resources on the topic of historic preservation's role in transit-oriented revitalization.   Discussion at the symposium and subsequent readings suggested that successful redevelopment around transit stations could be measured by simultaneous contributions to many goals, including improved access and multiple travel choices for a mix of activities near transit, where the station and its surroundings make for a lively, attractive place where people can do much more than ride public transit. The fundamental measure of success remains an economic one: housing units are occupied, businesses are prospering, and more people are riding transit.   Vital Signs for Returning Cities   Early in the study the project team agreed that there were characteristics and vital signs of transit and transit-related development policies that set communities apart from one another and seem to be abundantly present in successful transit-oriented development. Separating these vital signs out for examination and comment does not suggest that these indicators exist in isolation of one another. To the contrary: The essential correlation among these elements in the real world of transit and transit-related development is our critical finding. Professionals and advocates working in transit, development, urban revitalization, and historic preservation have told us that to be successful they felt they ""had to do everything"" and ""it all depended on everything working,"" affirming the paramount importance of incorporating all of these characteristics into planning, design, and construction.      ABOUT WALKING   Walking is successful public transit's significant other, just as it was at the turn of the last century when railroad interurbans and streetcars were the mobility choices of busy and expanding communities . Vincent Scully once noted that the reintroduction of trolleys into the urban fabric would have to be built on a pedestrian base,"" ... on the willingness of people to walk a little bit -- and to live a good deal longer.""   The successful importation of the good walking streets of bygone downtowns and old neighborhoods into the transit villages of the 21st century reminds us that walking infrastructure still exists in the transit villages of the previous century. These were places with wide sidewalks and narrow streets lined with shops open to the sidewalk and displaying wares, where human contact was encouraged and welcomed. Merchants along these thoroughfares prospered because of foot traffic. Blocks were not long. The grid was complete and functioned as a travel connector.   The idea that people can be encouraged to walk much more than they do just by changing the look and feel of places is at the heart of the transit village concept . Transit-oriented development that does not facilitate and encourage walking is missing the opportunity to offer travel alternatives that people are going to embrace. Reviving the pedestrian experience in the vicinity of transit stops can strengthen transit's capacity to meet its goal of slowing the growth of vehicle miles traveled.   A study in 2000 by S.B. Friedman & Company of Chicago polled commuter rail passengers about their trips to and from stations. The study found that a rider's decision to walk is affected by a ""pleasant walking atmosphere,"" defined as an interconnected network of streets with sidewalks and a continuous architectural fabric, with stores next to the station. Large parking lots and even parks can act as barriers between stations and surrounding neighborhoods.      HARMONY BETWEEN LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING   If the objectives of a transit system are to ease congestion, reduce auto-dependence, and improve air quality, then it stands to reason that development near transit should be as densely populated as the character of the place will permit, have mixed uses to encourage fewer automobile trips, and be as attractive as possible to potential patrons. Linked land use and transportation planning should also discourage exclusively auto-dependent land uses and excessive dispersal of commuter destinations that would work at cross purposes with transit investments.   Metropolitan planning organizations and regional councils of government are contributing to regionwide solutions. With their capacity to develop consensus and cooperation among local governments, regional agencies are uniquely equipped to promote supportive land use and zoning decisions on the part of local governments and to encourage better understanding of historic preservation values. For example, SANDAG, San Diego's regional planning agency, has unanimously adopted a regional transportation plan for 2030 that offers a blueprint for spending $42 billion on transit expansion, travel demand management measures, modest investments in freeway connections, and funding for small projects to strengthen links between transportation and land use.   Cities are also doing their part, implementing zoning and regulatory changes to encourage transit-supportive land use planning, promoting efforts to increase transit ridership, and supporting a regional commitment to public transit that supports continued economic growth.    COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT   Citizens and stakeholders must be a part of the many layers of public decisions that bolster community revitalization, transit, and transit-oriented development. Public support is necessary for success, and the public's sense of ownership will advance transit goals, facilitate agreement with difficult decisions such as zoning changes, and secure votes on critical public revenue decisions. Planning for redevelopment should elicit the participation of individual citizens as transit patrons and residents in compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods; as well as citizens serving in community-based organizations who can provide solutions, help disseminate information, work to build consensus, and break down skepticism. To be successful, public involvement ought to be open, honest, early, and continuous, and its capacity to produce good transit and development solutions should be sought after.    Smart Communities: Curbing Sprawl at Its Core , published by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, describes how Bethel New Life, Inc. a church-affiliated community development corporation (CDC), helped organize opposition to the Chicago Transit Authority's planned closing of the Lake/Pulaski station and the rest of the Green Line in the early 1990s. The neighborhood of West Garfield Park had lost 60 percent of its population since the 1960s and saw the threatened loss of the station and Green Line service as an opportunity to reverse its fortunes.   Bethel New Life provided Chicago with an alternative to what the city considered the surrender of yet another city neighborhood to outward migration. As a result of citizen and CDC effort, and the foresight to organize support from other communities along the Green Line, West Garfield Park has a newly renovated transit station, the Green Line has been modernized, and plans are underway for a massive mobilization of private and public resources around a community revitalization vision that is at once intensely local and broadly regional.    GOVERNANCE THAT SUPPORTS TRANSIT INVESTMENT AND TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT   Federal, state, regional, and local political jurisdictions have become major players in the successful development of public transit systems whose increasing use is fostered by good transit-oriented design. This book contains a variety of examples of decisions by government agencies that contribute to transit success, including the judicious investment of public funds to promote transit use.   Governments make many decisions that affect transit's capacity to achieve its broad policy goals. The fundamental lesson is that transit agencies must continually identify government incentives and barriers wherever they exist. What units of government do and do not do are very often critical to transit success, most importantly as they influence a community's ability to foster transit-oriented development.   For example, New Jersey adjusted its building codes in 1998 for the rehabilitation of older buildings by eliminating certain high-cost requirements that were designed for new construction but discouraged restoration. In addition to removing much of the guesswork and need for variances from rehabilitation approvals, the new code made possible an incredible 40.6 percent increase in rehabilitation work in the state's sixteen largest cities during the first year of enactment. Applications for the federal historic preservation tax credit increased five-fold following the code's adoption.   In California, level-of-service standards in the vicinity of transit stations were adjusted to ease requirements for additional road capacity to accommodate anticipated increases in auto traffic near transit stations. Cities and counties can now exempt themselves from state-mandated levels-of-service requirements by promoting transit ridership with mixed-use developments.   Chicago is in the midst of a major revision of its zoning law, the largest overhaul of its kind in any U.S. city in 40 years, according to  Governing  magazine. A code that was hailed as a national model 50 years ago is no longer capable of guiding the growth and urban revitalization Chicago is experiencing. Across the country, codes have become an obstacle to reviving pedestrian life in downtowns and neighborhood shopping districts. Neighborhoods, including historic residential districts, want rules that require infill housing to respect the architecture and character of the neighborhood.   The list of government actions that can determine success or failure for transit-supportive development is virtually endless. It includes items that influence how downtowns and neighborhood commercial centers will be revitalized. Public policies that set rules for planning, transportation, zoning, the quality and location of public services and facilities, parking, the preservation of historic structures and neighborhoods, community funding priorities, and more can make or break a place's plans for alternate transportation modes and supportive development.    PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION   Partnerships between governments and the private sector are evident in every case of successful community revitalization involving public transit. This collaboration is characterized variously by specific development projects, a local government or community revitalization strategy that promotes partnerships, and a myriad of practical arrangements that arise from unique community situations and opportunities, such as shared parking agreements. The older relationships between government and business, based on mistrust and an enforcement mentality that encouraged governments to micromanage private enterprise's involvement in communities, is giving way to mutually beneficial working relationships that create products neither government nor the private developer could produce alone. There are still rules, of course, and when they are applied consistently and fairly, developers can see active adherence to such rules as good business. The melding of public and private goods is seen as a progressive, pragmatic solution to the practical difficulty of getting things done.      ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING   Transit shaped the development of older and historic urban neighborhoods and first-ring suburbs, and then disappeared. Metropolitan areas promoting returning transit systems can ill afford to ignore the potential for patrons living in these neighborhoods of character and quality.   Much of America's existing supply of affordable housing is found in older and historic neighborhoods, according to an analysis by noted land use and real estate expert Donovan Rypkema that appeared in the Spring 2003 issue of the National Trust's Forum Journal. These neighborhoods are home to 31 percent of homeowners with household income below $20,000, and to 31 percent of African American, 24 percent of Hispanic, and 29 percent of elderly homeowners. Over half of all owner-occupied housing units in older and historic neighborhoods have monthly housing costs of less than $500.   Much of the existing housing stock in older and historic neighborhoods is being destroyed. This is a national tragedy, especially when public resources are being pumped into building replicas in new communities of what is being torn down in the older and historic neighborhoods. In the closing three decades of the 20th century, 6.3 million units of year-round housing in older and historic neighborhoods were destroyed.   Housing experts estimate a need for 18 million additional housing units in the first decade of the 21st century .Three million of them can be found today -- vacant and decaying -- in the country's older and historic neighborhoods .Their restoration and reuse, as part of a community's comprehensive reestablishment of transit-oriented development, should be a top priority. Affordable housing and home ownership opportunities near public transit for moderate-income working families in mixed-use, mixed-income settings may well be the easiest of all the Smart Growth goals to achieve, and the one with the most benefits, especially for the wealth-building aspirations of working families overwhelmed today by both housing costs and transportation costs occasioned by auto dependence.   Donovan Rypkema has observed that the first step policy makers can take is to ban the prevailing attitude that ""We have to destroy this neighborhood in order to save it,"" and the second is to accept the validity of the notion that it is very hard to build new and rent or sell inexpensively.   The success stories in downtown revitalization are in the cities and towns that maintained and reinvested in their historic buildings and recognized their character, quality, and ultimate desirability. In these places, historic preservation and restoration of public transit worked hand in hand to generate urban revitalization .The next logical step is to transfer the lessons and successes to the older and historic adjacent neighborhoods and the first-ring suburbs, where transit-oriented development first demonstrated its many benefits during the 20th century.      The partnership approach extends well beyond the critical pooling of resources by private developers and the public sector -- transit agencies and local government. Early involvement of citizens who know their neighborhoods and have earned the right to represent their views and interests -- such as Main Street groups, citizens associations, and community development corporations -- are helpful additions to the leadership of locally elected officials.    FLEXIBLE FINANCING   Like public-private collaboration, financing arrangement issues for transit-oriented developments often involve multiple sources of funds both public and private. Creative financing is a function of the strength of the public-private partnership and is frequently dependent upon the active participation of units of government.   Particularly where the revitalization of existing neighborhoods has residential, commercial, and public improvement components, as most do, and where revitalization is transit-oriented development on a neighborhood scale, the challenges to needed financing can be large and complex. The interdependence of vital signs involving the assembly of financing sources, community involvement, governmental commitments, planning, and public-private partnerships is especially evident, as is the potential for great gains for the many goals of public transit.   The mix of financing instruments -- mortgages, subordinated debt, grants, tax abatements and credits, and patient equity investments -- can be unique and rely on more partners bringing more financing sources than in the usual development project. More partners with more resources and more insights complicate and strengthen the financing of transit-oriented development, as does the involvement of a large number of rehabilitations of existing, privately owned buildings.   The potential of the federal New Markets Tax Credits, designed to stimulate business development in low and moderate income communities, is worth exploring. The 37 percent tax credit, offered over seven years for individuals and companies who invest in commercial projects, is expected to generate $15 billion in new capital by 2012.   Although New Markets gives no special preference to small and neighborhood businesses in commercial districts of older and historic areas, the program's emphasis on low- and moderate-income communities appears tailor-made for the commercial blocks of older, urban, and first-ring neighborhoods. Housing rental units would be eligible for New Markets as long as they are part of a mixed-use development and generate less than 80 percent of the building's overall revenue.   Kennedy Smith, director of the National Main Street Center, itself heavily involved in promoting the potential of New Markets to generate capital for neighborhood-serving business districts, says: ""Every dollar of New Markets Tax Credits awarded to investors supporting main street business development not only strengthens our historic commercial districts; it also prevents a dollar of the tax credits from being used to support suburban-style business development or to demolish historic main street buildings.""    PRAGMATIC, FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACHES TO PARKING   Parking needs can quickly become the tail wagging the dog when community revitalization strategies are on the table. Meeting a community's immediate parking needs while working to curb and even reduce those needs over time calls for sensitivity to other vital signs such as community awareness and involvement, governance, and economic factors. Transit systems have stages of development and maturity and are at specific stages of maturity in different parts of their own systems. Park-and-ride operations have a role to play in newer transit systems or at outlying stations, as do parking concessions for residents and commercial operations that address both transit use and residual auto dependence. Bolder parking policies are called for in places where the transit system is fully developed and quite capable of succeeding while discouraging driving.   Parking issues must be addressed pragmatically. Citizen reaction to density produced by commercial and residential developments is almost always about auto congestion and parking availability. Policy makers need to be sympathetic and skilled in navigating citizen concerns, and at the same time should advocate for parking schemes that rely on -- rather than conflict with -- the availability of transit and other services within a pleasant walking environment.   No aspect of transit-supportive development is more parochial than parking and less susceptible to generalized solutions, but it is important to understand that communities such as Gaithersburg, Maryland; Denver, Colorado; and South Orange, New Jersey are moving ahead to devise parking strategies based on the availability of transit within a good walking environment for many daily needs that reduces auto dependence and therefore demand for suburban-style parking arrangements.   Communities are focusing on the true costs of parking and how it adversely affects the costs of affordable housing. Excessive parking reduces the opportunity for transit and transit-oriented development to meet goals for reducing auto dependence. Transportation demand management; incentives for transit use, including employer-provided transit passes; an equalization of federal tax benefits provided for parking and transit; and the full range of trip-reduction capacities inherent in transit access and transit supportive development all can help communities committed to travel choices to break away from suburban-style parking approaches, when conditions warrant.    Measures of Success   The many partners in a successful transit-oriented revitalization need to measure their success separately as they remain mindful of the mutual benefits of their joint efforts. Transit agencies must demonstrate increased ridership. Metropolitan and air quality officials need to show a decline in the growth of vehicle miles traveled. Local governments and citizen groups often want clear signs that affordable housing has been preserved and real estate values maintained or increased. Mayors want to see rising sales tax revenue. Downtown civic groups and cities want to see the growth of jobs and activities downtown. Residents of older neighborhoods want to maintain or enhance home ownership and the quality of life they have come to expect where they live.   Less obvious but no less important are the qualitative measures of a successful revitalization involving historic preservation and transit. Among the many possibilities, we noted the following:   • Avid and continued interest among a variety of private and public entities in development opportunities for parcels large and small within the revitalization area; especially during an economic downturn;  • Sufficient maturity of a redevelopment area or a history of development cycles in an area that indicates long-term success;  • Presence of transportation choices that work together to increase transit use and promote community reinvestment;  • Intact historic resources with promising redevelopment and adaptive reuse opportunities, as well as patterns of settlement and travel that support and increase transit use and attract historic preservation;  • Financial success on the part of both the transit systems and the developers of property served by those systems; and  • Enthusiastic community acceptance of the blending of transit and redevelopment of historic places.    WHEN IS TOD REALLY TOD?   The study team understood that our use of the term transit-oriented development (TOD) would raise certain expectations and perhaps impose limitations on the study. TOD is a much-hyped concept, and with the hype has come a predictable amount of misinformation and misrepresentation within the policy and development worlds. Even the most knowledgeable proponents of TOD also tend to emphasize the development aspect of the concept. With some notable exceptions, including Michael Bernick's and Robert Cervero's  Transit Villages in the 21st Century , much of the existing literature on TOD is about new places created along transit corridors, with infrequent mention of the fact that many of the core concepts of TOD are derived from practices that were commonplace in years gone by.   The highly visible ""neo-traditional"" success stories have led to a notion of TOD as a new idea. In fact, new TOD developments promote transit use through time-honored strategies to create density and mixed uses, income diversity, and pedestrian-supportive design. Such characteristics are already present -- though often in need of rehabilitation and support -- in the older communities that thrived before the full flowering of our present highway-intensive way of life. Yet the resurgence of the many intact older communities that inspired the New Urbanism is less well known. We set out to shed light on this glaring gap in the story of America's great places.   Development that is merely adjacent to transit and lacks the characteristics necessary to support transit is unlikely to function very effectively as a generator of transit use. The transit villages that came of age in the late 19th century exhibited all the characteristics modern TOD proponents describe as ideal for today, including a coherent transportation pattern that worked within each transit village at the pedestrian scale and multiplied efficiently throughout corridors and regions, connecting neighborhoods and suburban towns to the urban core via public transportation. Transit shaped the development of many of these places and then disappeared. Some are being revitalized, with or without a strong transit component. Others are ripe to be recycled and reintegrated into the larger, once-vibrant, transit-connected metropolis of old. And still others just wait -- great wastes of urban resources whose return could contribute again to planned and well-managed metropolitan growth.   Today's transit-oriented development must take its cue from these historically efficient places, using them as backbones for redevelopment and compatible infill development. Our planning for transit-oriented developments must extend beyond station area development and into the metropolitan arena. The most successful TOD projects acknowledge and enhance a downtown's or neighborhood's contribution to public transit service regionwide. Just as a transit system that provides travel options is absolutely essential to metropolitan revitalization, a dynamic historic preservation component that offers many development opportunities is a most deliberate element in revitalization of the core, nearby neighborhoods, and outlying town centers still connected to the core.    THE RESURGENT CITY   Most cities have an active historic preservation component to their revitalization activities, of which public transit is also an integral part. As Donovan Rypkema has said, ""I have a hard time separating downtown revitalization and historic preservation, for one simple reason: I cannot identify a single sustained success story in downtown revitalization in a city of any size anywhere in the country where historic preservation was not a key element in the process.""   In selecting our case examples, we sought a cross-section of approaches to the challenge of inviting growth and preserving historic resources in and near downtowns, with a strong transit component. We focused slightly more attention on four cities and regions (coincidentally, all of them in Western states): Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Denver, Colorado; San Diego, California; and the San Francisco Bay Area. These regions each embody different aspects of the challenges and opportunities facing all thirteen of our study areas. In Denver, and San Diego, for example, adaptive reuse of individual buildings or clusters of buildings in the central business district is a practice of long standing that has led to more ambitious regional approaches to revitalization. Yet the connections among historic preservation, land use planning, and transit are more explicit in Denver than in San Diego, even though the opportunities are similar. In Dallas and Fort Worth, the private sector is discovering the benefits of anchoring residential and commercial development in historic areas that are newly served by state-of-the-art transit systems. In the Bay Area, the regional transit authority is working with several communities to correct flaws in the original siting of facilities and to recreate public space and Main Street-style thoroughfares in suburban centers.   Our smaller case studies highlight more discrete examples of successful transit-oriented development that incorporates historic preservation. For example, St. Louis and Cleveland have invested in rehabilitating historic transit lines or hubs at the same time that they invested in the historic centers and neighborhoods served by those facilities. Other communities -- such as Arlington, Virginia -- took advantage of proposed new transit facilities to restore and strengthen transit-oriented development where its legacy already existed. Major cities such as Washington, D.C. and Chicago, Illinois, planned station area redevelopment around historic resources along transit rail routes. Thus preservation becomes not only an activity to rescue existing historic resources in the urban core but also to restore the traditional forms that serve walking and transit in newer, more recently settled suburban centers and neighborhoods.   Even in auto-dependent regions of the country, such as the Sunbelt, governments and private developers are recognizing the wisdom of traditional development and historic resources as centerpieces for revitalization and transit investment. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), with jurisdiction over a 16-county area that includes Dallas, Fort Worth, and Denton, believes that the historic transit-supportive form of major downtowns can and should be replicated throughout the region. The historic farming community of Plano, which has grown practically overnight into an affluent, burgeoning city in its own right, is currently testing NCTCOG's assumptions with neotraditional planning, mixed-use development, and preservation of its small historic downtown as an integral part of its light rail transit investment.   The communities profiled in this book all show a conscious, citywide or regional commitment to build on preservation and adaptive reuse of historic resources as vital signs. Transit officials, city and regional planners, and private developers in these communities are aware that to be successful they had to ""do it all:"" promote preservation while encouraging redevelopment, encourage community input and acceptance while making sure the process didn't bog down or show insufficient progress, expand and diversify travel choices without putting the transportation cart before the land use horse; ascertain financial viability for transit and development projects while maintaining adequate public involvement and making decisions for the public good. The complex trade-offs and sophisticated partnerships that TOD calls for cannot take place without a concerted, ongoing commitment to an overall vision and redevelopment program.   Cities and downtown organizations are reaching beyond the immediate central business district to capture and enhance the revitalization benefits of nearby older neighborhoods. These neighborhoods often act as ""whole-cloth"" transit-oriented developments, demonstrating that transit-supportive density and residential desirability are not mutually exclusive, that good walking streets and easy access to transit are neighborhood characteristics as sought-after by homebuyers as good schools and other amenities; and that the irreplaceable historic character of these close-in neighborhoods, combined with their capacity to provide housing and homes for working families, makes them indispensable elements of any strategy to boost jobs and services downtown.   Cultural and historic resources make an essential contribution to urban and community revitalization, and to transit wherever it is part of the revitalization effort. The future of a downtown rests to a great degree on a willingness to invest in its past. In many cities across America, a commitment to a revitalized future rooted in historic preservation is being pursued side by side with the revitalization of public transit. They support one another, and together they support a strengthened core as the foundation of a successful regional transit system.    ""The bottom line: Today's transit-oriented planners increasingly acknowledge the wisdom of history, that what worked for the train spotters of yesterday holds the best promise of working for future rail riders.   And in linking transit to users, these planners are connecting to the American past of sensible town planning -- and putting increasing weight on the oldest of transportation vehicles: the human foot."" CHRISTINE KREYLING,  WRITING IN  PLANNING  JANUARY, 2001      Back to top   Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas   Sprawling Sunbelt Cities Adopt TOD   TRAVEL CHOICE COMES TO NORTH TEXAS   The Metroplex is typical of many Southwestern regions: big and rapidly growing bigger; with a strong, diverse economy; and dependent on an auto-oriented transportation system that feeds the spread of development ever outward. In recent years, the Metroplex has committed itself to regional public transit and travel choice, as necessary for continued economic prosperity. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), a voluntary association of local governments that is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Metroplex, has devised its long-term transportation plan to guide the expenditure of federal, state, and local funds for transportation improvements in ways that will encourage more economical land use and sustainable development.   Mobility 2025: The Metropolitan Development Plan , developed by NCTCOG's Regional Transportation Council, defines four sustainable development categories: strategic urban development, integrated land-use planning/urban design, transit-oriented development, and access management. The plan includes financial support for local initiatives to revitalize town centers, create mixed-use growth centers, and promote transit- and pedestrian-oriented developments as well as infill and brownfield reclamation. The plan will help local government complement rail investments with coordinated investments in park-and-ride, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities, and other means of promoting access to public transit.   The Metroplex faces challenges to maintaining these efforts. Although downtown revitalization has taken hold in both major cities, developers often still prefer to build out where land is plentiful and inexpensive. Many residents of the Metroplex still seem willing to withstand air quality problems, traffic congestion, and long commutes in order to indulge a strong preference for driving alone.   Both Dallas and Fort Worth have stunning historic architecture in their downtowns and nearby cultural districts, including National Historic Landmarks and National Register-listed resources, from the Fort Worth Stockyards and commercial area to Dallas's 277-acre Fair Park Cultural District, where Art Deco museum and exhibit buildings constructed for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition have been reused for contemporary art and science museums.    The older neighborhoods of Dallas and Fort Worth are eclectic treasure troves of vernacular residential architecture, including late Victorian gingerbread houses and Prairie-style houses with generous front porches, and numerous duplex townhouses from the 1920s through the 1950s that increase population density without affecting the quiet residential character of tree-lined streets near downtown.   Since the early 1980s, a small but muscular cadre of private entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and city residents in both Dallas and Fort Worth have established a welcoming culture for historic preservation and adaptive reuse in and near downtown, demonstrating to the cities and the public at large the economic and community benefits of preserving the unique character and sense of place of neighborhoods and commercial centers. The region's plans for growth include revitalization of Dallas and Fort Worth, cities where the historic structures are concentrated, where historic preservation has value, and where the impulse for transportation choice is strongest. Multiple goals are being pursued side by side, and the unfolding of it all is worth a good look.   Image: Historic buildings enliven the streetscape along the Dallas Transitway Mall.    Dallas   The phenomenon of central business district revitalization advancing hand in hand with the growth of the regional rail transit system is evident in Dallas and reinforces the essential interdependence of these phenomena. Downtown Dallas is determined to recover its former preeminent position as the region's center of employment, services, entertainment, and amenities, and to reestablish the downtown's interaction with its historic urban neighborhoods and first-ring suburbs.   COMMUNITY HISTORY   Dallas began as a humble trading post on 614 acres at the fork of the Trinity River. Although for decades it was scoffed at as a ""one-horse town,"" Dallas experienced a population explosion with the coming of the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1872. Thereafter, it quickly developed as a premier center of banking and commerce and an international gateway for the oil and livestock trades, as well as a center for retail, new technologies of the day such as the telegraph, and culture.   When a headquarters for the Magnolia Petroleum Company was built in the 1920s, it was the tallest building in Texas, and remained so for two decades. Dallasites routinely bragged that it was the biggest building south of Washington, D.C. Its striking rooftop oil derrick holding a huge neon red Pegasus -- now rebuilt and again lighting the evening sky -- continues to serve as an icon of the city's past.   Brash, business-savvy, and family-friendly Dallas has long been one of the country's choice places to live. Its unique blend of bright city lights and downhome Texas culture complement an uncanny ability to recover economically from setbacks that might send other cities reeling, from the S&L crisis of the 1980s to the more recent national plummet of the high-tech sector. Banking, fashion, film, and innovative retail and restaurant concepts such as the Container Store and Chili's chain of restaurants have kept Dallas's economic base secure.   The very strengths of this booming Texas city have presented challenges to its development of a mature identity and sense of its own history. Dallas began to define this identity for itself earlier in the century when it adopted the central elements of the Kessler Plan, an early growth management model for the city created in 1911. Initially intended to address the periodic and problematic flooding of the Trinity River, the Kessler plan also created marvelous green space in central Dallas and developed a straightforward grid for downtown.   But the deeply rooted regard for private property and business development rights, local zoning that strongly promoted single-use development, and abundant land at the city's fringes have made big exurban development irresistible in Big D. In the inner city, teardowns and demolitions were the order of the day during much of the 1960s and 1970s in the name of progress, defined by increased auto access to and from downtown via North Central Expressway and other highways and arterials. In and around downtown, many historic areas were simply bypassed and important contributing buildings were boarded up or underused, resulting in at least partial ""mothballing"" of some of Dallas's finest historic resources.   The sense that preservation of historic structures was vital to the city's well being grew in Dallas during the 1970s and 1980s, as in most American cities, in response to the loss or neglect of important landmarks. The first historic preservation ordinance was adopted in 1973, establishing a landmarks commission and the Swiss Avenue Historic District. The West End Historic District in downtown was created shortly thereafter. The demolition of the elegant Art Deco Dr. Pepper headquarters on Mockingbird Lane in 1996, just days after it was designated a local landmark -- and the near-loss of its locally beloved clock tower, showing the traditional Dr. Pepper break times of 10, 2, and 4 -- stimulated interest in a stronger historic preservation ordinance for the City of Dallas. Today the tower still stands in front of a sensitively designed Kroger's grocery store on the old Dr. Pepper site, and across the street from Mockingbird Station, a mixed-use transit station redevelopment.   In 1996 Councilwoman Veletta Forsythe Lill convened a coalition of preservationists, developers, and other citizens to develop a new ordinance that strengthened protections for historic places, revised the rules for historic designations, and established a preservation fund. The City Council unanimously passed the ordinance in January 2000. The combination of a stronger preservation ordinance, city property tax abatements, and federal historic preservation tax credits has stimulated greater interest among private developers in restoration and adaptive reuse of many downtown Dallas landmarks. A former department store was developed into residences and an urban campus for six different colleges. The beautiful Majestic Theatre and many other significant historic structures have been renovated and adaptively reused in the downtown Dallas revitalization campaign. The Central Dallas Association, with over 150 member companies, promotes the interests of downtown and works closely with city government, DART, and other public-private partners on behalf of economic growth and revitalization.   Image: Southside on Lamar transforms the historic Sears Catalog Center into a major mixed-use, mixed-income transit oriented development.   Former Mayor Ron Kirk wrote last year about the mix of motivations that are promoting historic preservation in Dallas. In addition to the obvious contributions to economic development prompted by attractive tax incentives, there is also a growing realization in Dallas that ""the places of our past add to the fabric of our community. The past is becoming a part of our future."" Kirk and others acknowledge the work of an extensive public-private partnership that includes DART, city government, the business community, creative developers, dedicated homeowners in the historic districts, and private organizations such as Preservation Dallas and the Friends of Fair Park.    TRANSPORTATION   Dallas area voters rejected the idea of an area-wide transit system for Dallas and Fort Worth in the late 1970s, largely because the proposal was too expensive, premature, and not particularly well thought out. But by 1983 Dallas voters and those from thirteen other cities in the area had approved a one-cent sales tax dedicated to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) for public transit. Citizens also exercised patience and understanding during the 13 years it took to plan, build, and open the 20-mile light rail starter system.   The North Central (12.3 miles) and Northeast (11.2 miles) corridor extensions opened in 2002, under budget and six months ahead of schedule. The expansion to North Dallas, Richardson, Garland, and Plano underscores the authentic regional nature of the DART rail system. The opening of the stations brings the DART system to 44 miles and 34 stations, completing one of the largest rail expansion projects in North America.   An article in the May 2001 issue of  Urban Land  noted that public transit in Dallas has become ever more important as traffic conditions and air quality have grown steadily worse. Traffic delays in Dallas increased by 37 percent between 1995 and 1999. Population in the region grew by 10 percent while vehicle miles traveled increased by 18 percent. The Dallas central business district was in deep decline as jobs moved further from the city core.   Community leaders and voters embarked on an ambitious plan to build 96 miles of light rail by 2016, 22 miles of commuter rail, and 110 miles of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes; as well as to undertake related efforts, including Intelligent Transportation Systems and Travel Demand Management. The plan included aggressive economic development along light rail corridors to promote transit use and rebuild downtown and urban neighborhoods.   In 2000, 77 percent of area voters approved a $2.4 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind ever approved in Texas, to expand and accelerate DART's light rail system. The bonds are guaranteed by future sales tax revenues. A Federal Transit Administration Full Funding Grant Agreement of $333 million under the New Starts Program is a critical element in the financial arrangements supporting the current doubling of the DART light rail starter system. The starter system alone has exceeded everyone's expectations in terms of ridership and economic development. While recession and job losses in the region produced a 10.5 percent drop in bus ridership in 2002, a 19.3 percent increase in DART rail and a 58.3 percent rise in trips on Trinity Railway Express helped keep systemwide ridership declines to just under 2 percent.   A recession-induced decline in sales tax revenues, which represents 88 percent of DART's income, may force another one-year delay in the next phase of its light rail expansion of 22 miles and 16 stations northwest to Carrollton and southeast to Buckner Boulevard. Part of the expansion anticipates federal financial participation through the New Starts Program and part will be supported with local funds.   Image: Historic buildings at the former Sears Catalog facility are part of the Matthews Southwest transit-oriented development at DART's Cedars Station.   DART's system expansion plans and its other improvements are in a foot race with clogged roads and deteriorating air quality. In addition to light rail expansion, DART's growing miles of HOV lanes, investments that reduce emissions from the bus fleet, pedestrian and bus access to the rail system, and development in the vicinity of transit stations are working together to lower the rate of growth of vehicle miles traveled.    DOWNTOWN DALLAS NOW   Centered on Main Street and the mixed-use infill and redevelopment projects nearby, downtown Dallas is being transformed. The principal ingredients are light rail and attractive, convenient access between the light rail system and retail, offices, residences, government and personal services, entertainment, and amenities.   The Central Business District's light rail corridor -- the Transitway Mall -- is the spine of DART's system and reflects the transit agency's commitment to the reestablishment of Dallas as the hub of the region's economic, social, and cultural life. Historic Dallas Union Station and a major bus transfer station near the West End transit stop provide intermodal connections. Stations are within walking distance of major employers and attractions, and are connected to many bus routes.   Joel Warren Barna wrote in  Texas Architect  in 1999 that DART's economic development operations since the 1980s have been based on the concept that public-private partnerships -- directly supporting rail transit -- can create new patterns of urban development. DART has in effect seeded its own operating efficiency by stimulating greater density around its stations and their adjacent neighborhoods.    FINANCING TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT   Like many cities in America, Dallas and its sister cities in North Texas make extensive use of tax increment financing for needed public improvements in areas adjacent to transit stations. City, county, and school districts forgo revenue increases on the growing value of property in the TIF districts and agree instead to devote new revenues to paying off bonds that provide public improvements within the district.    AWALT BUILDING   The six-story, 65,000-square-foot Awalt Building stands adjacent to DARTs CBD Transitway Mall at the West End Station, the system's busiest, and is home to Slingshot Communications' 50 employees, a ground-floor restaurant, and other commercial tenants. Built in the early years of the 20th century, the building was abandoned in the 1980s. When Slingshot started looking for a new home downtown, the Awalt was in the worst shape of all the buildings the company looked at and required the greatest leap of faith. Now Slingshot boasts that the building is ""located on the corner of the 19th and 21st centuries"" and has made the building's renovation for high-tech use a cornerstone of its company identity (to view information about the Awalt Building on Slingshot's web site, go to  http://www.davidandgoliath.com/awalt.asp ).   Slingshot Communications wanted to be downtown, particularly in the West End. It worked with the Dallas Landmarks Commission's West End Task Force, and was greatly influenced by the presence of light rail on the doorstep of the Awalt Building, and by the location's pedestrian-friendly character.   The City of Dallas was greatly interested in the redevelopment of this dilapidated eyesore. Slingshot Communications sought advice from a full range of city officials, especially those responsible for historic preservation projects, before making an offer to the Awalt's owner. The advertising agency was able to move into its top-floor office space just ten months after purchase. Extensive early consultations, hiring the services of an architect experienced in historic preservation work, and maintaining a good working relationship with city officials, helped keep Slingshot's surprises to a minimum.   Challenges to the project included reconciling historic preservation requirements with universal access needs under the Americans with Disabilities Act, plus other unexpected costs, but the company's attitude was, ""Why buy a 1905 building if you don't want it to look like a 1905 building?"" Federal historic preservation tax credits and a ten-year abatement of city and county property taxes helped to make the numbers work, and the company became an owner-tenant of the building with monthly mortgage payments no greater than the rent it had previously paid. Twenty percent of Slingshot's employees use transit, and the company provides both a transit benefit and reimburses transit riders for a few lunches per month.   Jeremy Leonard of Slingshot tells the story of a restaurant that expressed interest in the ground-floor commercial space but held off making an offer in order to reexamine demographics. A short time later, the restaurant signed a letter of intent. All it really needed to do, the restaurant said, was to count the number of people who passed the location every day, on foot and light rail, who would be reading its on-site advertising.    Image: The historic Awalt Building was in serious disrepair when Slingshot Communications purchased the building for adaptive reuse.    SOUTHSIDE ON LAMAR   Adjacent to DART's Cedars Station, immediately southeast of downtown, Matthews Southwest has developed a 39-acre parcel, the centerpiece of which is the historic nine-story Sears Catalog Center, opened in 1910. The $75 million development includes 455 lofts that occupy 900,000 square feet, 120,000 square feet of office space, and 34,000 square feet for retail and other arts related uses in a ground-floor retail arcade running the length of the building along a former railroad tunnel.   In addition to federal historic preservation tax credits and property tax abatements from the city, Matthews Southwest secured a low interest loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in return for setting aside 20 percent of the 455 lofts for below-market-rate rentals. All of these incentives helped make the financing possible. The Sears Catalog Center and other buildings within the old Sears compound had been designated both Dallas and National Historic Landmarks.   South Side at Lamar has stimulated other economic development projects in the immediate vicinity of Cedars Station, including a new Dallas police headquarters, an $18 million Gilleys country-western entertainment complex in two existing structures, and other entertainment and amenity facilities.   Both historic preservation and easy access to public transit have made this major development possible. Pete Coughlin, development coordinator for the project, observed, ""DART was a key in getting the project funded and in bringing people here. We are creating a 24-hour environment, and DART makes that possible."" Coughlin also remarked that residents enjoy living in an historic building and appreciate its historic interior features: fluted columns, natural ceilings, original maple floors, and exposed brick walls.    PLANO   At first a small farming community, Plano developed into a city in the 1870s after the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. From 1907 to 1948 it was connected to Dallas, its neighbor to the south, by the North Texas Interurban. After the demise of rail service and an explosion of residential growth to the north and west, Plano's old downtown stagnated. Light rail service has returned to Plano along the same right-of-way that promoted its growth late in the 19th century, and helped sustain it through the first half of the 20th.    Anticipating the arrival of light rail, Plano has been planning and preparing for years to transform downtown back into a transit village. The city's turn-of-the-century historic district is adjacent to the new Plano Station, and restoration of the city's historic structures in the station area is a conscious part of the redevelopment plan supported by a tax increment financing district and property tax abatements.    In addition to restoring historic resources, Plano approved a major new development called East Side Village, designed to match the historic character of the surrounding 19th century architecture. East Side Village contains 500 residential units, 40,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, and a 2,000-square-foot city conference center. Apartments rent from $600 to $1,200 per month. Plano's station area development is pedestrian-friendly and in harmony with the principles of the modern transit village.    ""Our goal is to transform downtown Plano into an urban, transit-oriented town center by expanding business, housing, and the arts within one-quarter mile of the station,"" says Frank Turner, executive director of the Plano Development Business Center. In support of Plano's plan, the DART station has bus bays and a kiss-and-ride, but no long-term parking. The station is designed to fit the look and feel of the downtown. A municipal center, courthouse, and school district offices are within walking distance, as are a park and single-family homes.    MCKINNEY AVENUE TROLLEY   The redevelopment of McKinney Avenue in Uptown Dallas in the early 1980s included restoration of its brick pavement. During the work, the double tracks of an old streetcar line were unearthed. Volunteers from the retail and business community donated funds to determine the feasibility of reinstating the trolley in the neighborhood. The McKinney Avenue Transit Authority was created in 1983, and four vintage streetcars were purchased and carefully restored.    In 1989, for the first time in 33 years, a streetcar ran under its own power on 2.8 miles of newly restored tracks on McKinney Avenue. The big news for devotees of historic trolleys as well as transportation choice advocates is that the McKinney Avenue Trolley is now linked at its northern end to DART's light rail system at the Cityplace station. DART patrons can transfer to the streetcar to tour McKinney Avenue restaurants, art galleries, boutiques, and the new West Village -- a transit village that combines condominium residences with upscale shopping and dining.    MATA expects to construct another expansion in the near future, southward to link up with the West End Historic District. The Texas Department of Transportation has allocated a total of $6.4 million of its federal transportation enhancements funds to help the non-profit organization that owns and operates the trolley.    TRINITY RAILWAY EXPRESS (TRE)   Dallas and Fort Worth created the Trinity Railway Express to reestablish a commuter rail connection that linked them together from 1902 to 1934, when the Northern Texas Traction Company shut down its intercity line. In autumn 2001, full service resumed between the cities' two historic passenger terminals, Dallas Union Station and the Texas and Pacific Railroad Station in Fort Worth.    Dallas and Fort Worth jointly purchased the old Rock Island Line right-of-way in 1983 for $34 million and created TRE as a joint venture of their transit agencies. Service was inaugurated on the line's first leg at the end of 1996, from Dallas Union Station west to South Irving. This phase was funded largely from DART's one percent sales tax, Federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) grant funds, and the sale of usage rights to rail freight operators.    Tarrant County, for which Fort Worth is the county seat, assumed responsibility for the $184 million needed for the 25-mile second phase of the project, using a combination of Federal Transit Administration New Starts and other program funds, a second CMAQ grant, sales tax receipts from Fort Worth and the other area cities sharing the service.    TRE has become very popular. Ridership grew by 58 percent in the first year of full operations, to over 2 million, supported in part by the train's impressive intermodal, downtown connections.    In Dallas, TRE links up with DART's Red and Blue Lines at Union Station. Fort Worth built a new centrally located Intermodal Transit Center that also serves Amtrak and Greyhound Bus and provides bus and shuttle connections to major Fort Worth destinations. TRE offers shuttle bus service to DFW airport from one of its stations to help attract riders from among the over 50,000 people who are employed at or near DFW. A combined DART and TRE Victory Station is under construction just west of the West End in Dallas, adjacent to American Airlines Center, the home of the Dallas professional basketball and hockey teams. A temporary TRE station presently offers service to the teams' home games.    Extension of TRE and the development of additional commuter rail service figure prominently in multimodal transportation planning throughout the Metroplex, but especially in Fort Worth, where the future rail component of the city's transportation plan decision is still evolving.    Lessons learned   •  Historic buildings in the central business district are important orientation points for rail station siting.  DART's station site decisions in the 1980s took into account the major redevelopment of the West End Historic District and Dallas's Union Station to put the ""there back there"" as the rail system was put back in place.   •  Business developers can -- and do -- support transit-oriented revitalization if the public sector sends the right signals and offers incentives.  Dallas, DART, participating cities, and NCTCOG understand the benefits of promoting economic development in station areas. Transit-related zoning and land use plans, special financial incentives, investment in public infrastructure, and urban design concepts are being used to counter the region's overall sprawling, autocentric development patterns. DART reaches out to developers to make their work easier. ""We provide education, coordination with member cities, connections to other developers,"" says Jack Wierzenski, assistant vice president of economic development and planning for DART. ""We accommodate developers any way we can.""   •  Strong historic preservation ordinances enhance and clarify the climate for private development.  Dallas's new preservation ordinance sends a clear signal to private developers that historic resources are valued and irreplaceable elements in the city's fabric. The ordinance's establishment of a preservation fund, along with stronger tests for demolition, combines with municipal property tax abatements and other supportive city measures to stimulate investment in restoration and adaptive reuse of many downtown Dallas landmarks.    Signs of success   Improved access provided by DART rail stations is enhancing nearby residential and office property valuations, according to 2002 research conducted by the University of North Texas Center for Economic Development and Research. From 1997 to 2001, residential properties near DART rail stations increased in value by 39 percent more on average than comparable properties not served by rail. Office buildings near DART rail lines increased in value 53 percent more than comparable properties elsewhere. According to the Dallas Association of Realtors, ""DART has been a huge economic driver in the region, and it will continue to be as the rail system expands and matures.""    Now DART is also working to redress development gaps between stations. One such area is the Good Latimer Transit Mall/Deep Ellum Gateway, an area caught between the central business district and the busy arts and residential district of Deep Ellum. ""Our goal is to design a station that is conducive to future development,"" says Jack Wierzenski, of DART. "" Since we're not yet sure what developers will want to do, we're preparing the station to be very flexible and accessible. When developers come in, they'll find not barriers but accommodation. ""Reinvestment in historic properties is contributing greatly to downtown's rebirth. The pragmatism generated by tax breaks, the emerging demand for loft-style housing in the heart of the city, and opportunities for creative mixed uses of older commercial buildings has helped to build a residential community of 17,000 in downtown Dallas where none existed before. Neighborhoods near downtown also benefit. Ken Hughes, president of UC Urban and the developer of the creative and highly acclaimed mixed-use project at Mockingbird Station (near where the old Dr. Pepper plant once stood), says: ""The proximity of the DART station and the growing ridership made the Mockingbird Station attractive and doable, and we're not doing it halfway.""    Not only are occupancy and rental rates increasing in buildings near stations throughout the system, tenants are returning to downtown from the suburbs. For example, the professional services firm KPMG, which moved out of downtown in 1992, returned a decade later and now occupies twice as much office space as before, in a building just steps from the St. Paul Station on the Transitway Mall. According to the firm that arranged the move, DART was one of the key ingredients for the consolidation of KPMG back downtown.    Fort Worth   Fort Worth, like other returning cities, understands that its central business district is its preeminent urban village: an economically, culturally, and socially vibrant center that binds the larger community together and helps to build civic identity through its powerful sense of place. As the center city prospers, private and public investment ripples out into surrounding neighborhoods.   Fort Worth's plan for revitalization recognizes that transportation investment must be directed toward a system to manage movement within a denser urban form, so that vibrant economic growth is not strangled by the kind of mobility it generates. The city's current plan for downtown transportation is multimodal, features convenient and attractive access among modes, and relies on good public transit and good walking streets.   Historic preservation is an important part of the city's comprehensive plan and greatly influences the way the city looks at itself and its future. The city preserves historic resources to protect its quality of life, its pride of place and its sense of community. Fort Worth is committed to passing its rich and colorful history on to future generations.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Established in 1849, Fort Worth began as an army outpost and soon became the last major stop on the legendary Chisholm Trail, the dusty path where millions of cattle were driven North to market. Downtown Fort Worth came to be known as ""Hell's Half Acre,"" a rowdy district catering to the rough cowboy trade, with gambling parlors, saloons, and dance halls. The railroad era transformed the Fort Worth Stockyards into a premier livestock center, and downtown Fort Worth grew in complexity and sophistication.   When oil began to gush in West Texas, Fort Worth was at the center of the burgeoning oil industry. Still known affectionately as ""Cowtown,"" Fort Worth has preserved the architecture and rich heritage of its downtown through numerous redevelopments, including Sundance Square, a 20-block area featuring some of Fort Worth's oldest and architecturally unique structures, mostly turn-of-the-century storefronts. Some 50 shops, restaurants, theatres, bars, and clubs are all within walking distance of each other in Sundance Square, enhanced by attractive landscaping and brick-paved streets.   Sundance Square and its developers, the Fort Worth Bass family, are credited with launching downtown revitalization in the early 1980s. The critical truth embedded in the Bass family approach to Sundance Square is the realization that first-rate historic preservation makes first-rate places, not just in terms of buildings and streets but also the way that the denizens of the returning city use these places. Before the Bass family invested in Fort Worth's Sundance Square, the area's historic resources suffered from neglect.   In an essay published in the March 2002 issue of  Urban Land  magazine, Ed Bass stated an urban redevelopment principle that can be used to test the soundness of revitalization planning generally, especially as its transportation component is being devised. ""Cities need to learn to capitalize on their streets, city blocks, sidewalks, storefronts, and the comings and goings of a whole variety of people engaged in a whole gamut of activities.""   From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, more than $850 million in private investment was pumped into Sundance Square, with most of the risk being assumed by the Bass brothers. The extent of their investment guaranteed that the place would have the look and feel they were aiming to create. As a result, the northern end of downtown Fort Worth has 20 movie screens, an assortment of nightclubs and live theater venues, office space, several dozen restaurants, hotels, retail tenants like Barnes and Noble, and a significant infusion of new residents.   The city has also played a principal role in downtown transformation, pumping nearly $300 million in public funds into downtown projects, including federal grants. Special taxing districts have been created, property tax abatements have assisted many projects, and active organizations representing the private revitalization stakeholders, like Historic Fort Worth and Downtown Fort Worth, help round out the public-private partnership that is a hallmark of success in so many urban revitalization efforts.    TRANSPORTATION   The City of Fort Worth and the Fort Worth Transportation Authority (the T) jointly developed a Fort Worth Light Rail Streetcar Starter Project, a 7.6-mile, double-tracked streetcar system intended to connect Fort Worth's Intermodal Transportation Center, the Trinity Railway Express, and new bus transfer facilities downtown with Fort Worth's employment centers, major destinations, and neighborhoods. The starter project was endorsed by the City Council and the T in 2002 as the first phase of a larger streetcar system that could be implemented over the next 20 to 30 years.   The 2002 decision has been placed on hold pending a review of transportation priorities by the city's new administration. Also on hold is Fort Worth's formal application for a $92.5 million Federal Transit Administration New Starts grant, representing 50 percent of the project's total cost, for the city's locally preferred alternative, a project designed to link the central business district with the city's cultural and medical districts and several central city neighborhoods. The city's 50 percent of the project cost is expected to come from flexible federal sources like the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, local transit sales tax revenues (half-cent as opposed to DART's 1-cent), and $62.5 million from municipal bonds. A citywide election will be needed to approve the municipal bonds, and the availability of flexible federal transportation funds is subject to the approval of the regional council of governments.    MAKING THE TOD CONNECTION   Fort Worth's extensive urban revitalization efforts are closely tied to an eventual multimodal, interdependent transportation system that will facilitate and encourage walking and good connections for the city's buses. The automobile's primacy in the city is not going to be supplanted, but investment in alternative travel choices to and from resurgent neighborhoods, downtown, and the city's key activity centers will ease auto congestion, improve air quality, and offer the capacity to reduce vehicle miles traveled.   The New Starts application, in its present form, emphasizes the regional transportation connections that light rail will give Fort Worth, its conformity to regional land use and sustainable development goals, and a firm commitment to the principles of genuine transit- oriented development: mixed use, mixed income, greater density at and near transit stops, and the best walking connections possible. The city has already enacted two mixed-use zoning classifications that are transit-supportive and consistent with the package of revitalization efforts.   Image: Meticulously restored historic buildings within Sundance Square bear out the Bass family belief that first-rate historic preservation makes first-rate places.    LANCASTER AVENUE AND THE TEXAS AND PACIFIC PASSENGER TERMINAL   When an elevated segment of I-30 was torn down in 2002 and its replacement completed further south, the uncovering of Lancaster Avenue opened up an opportunity to reunite downtown. The street is a wide expanse of road that is beautifully suited to transformation into an elegant urban boulevard. Along Lancaster Avenue are architectural gems, isolated since the 1960s by a segment of I-30 that was elevated freeway, and now ready for restoration and reuse. A refurbished, beautified, and pedestrian friendly Lancaster Avenue could connect the southern end of downtown to the city's expanding cultural district just to the west.   The present terminus of TRE in Fort Worth is the Texas and Pacific Rail Passenger terminal, one of the city's premier historic landmarks. The Fort Worth Transportation Authority, which owns the first-floor waiting room and adjacent boardroom, restored them with federal transportation enhancements funding granted by the Texas Department of Transportation. The terminal building's owners tried unsuccessfully to convince the city to help renovate the upper floors into a hotel. Plans are now underway to develop those floors into 130 apartments while adding a four-story, 92-unit apartment building and parking garage east of the terminal. Both Fort Worth and Tarrant County have agreed to grant historic tax exemptions for the project.   Fort Worth's starter light rail streetcar, as presently envisioned, would connect with the T&P terminal on its north-south axis from the Sundance Square- Tarrant County Court House area to the Medical District. The terminal's restoration for in-town living is expected to quicken private revitalization efforts in the Lancaster Avenue corridor.    FORT WORTH RAIL MARKET   Public and private restoration and revitalization activities are also in full swing in Fort Worth's midtown section. Just south of the new Intermodal Transit Center (ITC), the historic Santa Fe Warehouse has been restored and reopened as the Fort Worth Rail Market. In a 23,000-square-foot canopied space between the rail market and the ITC, the T and the Fort Worth Rail Market operate an outdoor farmers' market on weekends during spring and summer. According to the market's web site ( http://www.fortworthrailmarket.com ) ""The Fort Worth Rail Market ... builds on the synergy created by other downtown developments, including the Intermodal Transportation Center (ITC), Fort Worth Convention Center expansion, the Convention Center Plaza, Water Garden and Hyde Park improvements, and the Lancaster Avenue Redevelopment.""   The Market was constructed in 120 days and opened on May 25, 2002. More than 40,000 square feet of permanent retail space is available for up to twenty year-round tenants. The expanded convention center is nearby, and Fort Worth's light rail streetcar will serve the area as the TRE already does. The city, in a partnership with the T, the U.S. General Services Administration, and Downtown Fort Worth, Inc, is also planning a new Downtown Civic Square on the site of historic 19th century Hyde Park. Only a few blocks from the Santa Fe Rail Market, the civic square will be an important element in the mix of transit- and pedestrian-connected attractions and destinations in the mid-town section of Fort Worth.

Signs of success   Fort Worth's long-discussed and much-planned light rail trolley is still years away from operation, but the urban revitalization it is being designed to serve and sustain is well underway. The urban model that NCTCOG sees as a means to build up centers of mixed-use development throughout the region has been working over the last 25 years in center city Fort Worth. Studies of the city have identified a demand for city living and a growing residential market. Both Pier 1 and Radio Shack are constructing new national headquarters downtown, and Fort Worth's nightlife is vibrant, especially in Sundance Square. Public investments in services and amenities abound. Old and historic buildings are being restored and reused.   Just one year after its grand opening, the Fort Worth Rail Market is now home to a lively mix of specialty food stores, other retail establishments, and small independent restaurants. Four retail spaces remain to be leased. David Pettit, director of development for Downtown Fort Worth, Inc., states ""Current negotiations with a butcher, sausage, and deli vendor will complete the desired tenant mix outlined in the original plans for the Market. Additionally, negotiations are underway for the second floor restaurant space, offering 5,500 square feet of intimate, indoor dining and an additional 5,000 square feet of patio dining overlooking downtown."" The restaurant is scheduled to open early this fall. In attracting new tenants and seasonal vendors, the management of the Rail Market has made much of nearby transportation connections and the historic value of the site and nearby attractions. Citing the 10,000 daily boardings on the Trinity Railway Express and the status of the ITC as the transportation hub for all of Tarrant County, the Fort Worth Rail Market also positions to prospective vendors as part of the ""downtown synergy"" that includes a mix of old and new Fort Worth, from Sundance Square to the new convention center, both just minutes away.    Lessons learned   •  Private, independent, ""isolated"" efforts at downtown revitalization do pay big dividends in later efforts toward transit-supportive development.  Sundance Square and its developers, the Fort Worth Bass family, are credited with launching downtown revitalization in the early 1980s. According to Urban Land magazine, Fort Worth affirms the urban development theory that medium-sized cities ""should focus on a specific district for revitalization, concentrating efforts to produce critical mass and more visible results."" Fort Worth has demonstrated how returning cities can expand the experiences of individual district revitalization to other parts of downtown.   •  Transit agencies should seek opportunities to lead and develop historic downtown areas that could serve and be served by transit.  The Fort Worth Transportation Authority and leaders of the ITC effort not only were ""plugged in"" to develop trends and opportunities in downtown, they took leadership roles in clearing the way for transit-oriented development near the ITC and other downtown transportation facilities.       Back to top   Denver, Colorado   Blueprint for a Living City   DOWNTOWN STRATEGY BUILDS ON EARLIER EFFORTS   Denver, Colorado is undergoing a renaissance of transportation choices and downtown revitalization, thanks to 40 years of visionary planning and energetic community efforts. Blueprint Denver, created in 2002, is a growth and transportation strategy for promoting and protecting the city's livability, with an emphasis on the interdependence of downtown with the historic residential neighborhoods that surround it. The citywide strategy within Blueprint Denver is focused on absorbing 109,000 new jobs and 132,000 more residents by 2022.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Built in the boom years of the mid-19th century, downtown Denver suffered from decreasing investment after the silver bust of 1893, a trend that accelerated with the ascendancy of the automobile in the first half of the 20th century. In 1965, real estate developer Dana Crawford launched a 20-year effort to save downtown from dereliction and slum clearance. Her early successes helped create a strong preservation ethic in Denver. By 1971, the city had both a landmarks commission and a private nonprofit organization, Historic Denver, Inc. In 1974 the city rezoned Lower Downtown-a threatened treasure trove of industrial and commercial architecture-for mixed use, including loft apartments and retail. A second rezoning in 1982 offered incentives for property owners to preserve historic buildings. After a seven-year struggle, Lower Downtown was designated a historic district in 1989. Denver promptly established the Lower Downtown Business Support Office to market the area to investors and manage a loan fund to help with gap financing, facade improvements, and upgrades required by building codes.   Even these positive steps still proved inadequate to stem the development pressure on downtown Denver, where high rises were being built right beside historic structures. In 2000, the city created the Downtown Denver Historic District to protect and preserve 43 historic buildings in the central business district. Many of the protected buildings were already rehabilitated and in use when the designation took effect. The new district includes the 16th Street transit mall, an international model for integrating mixed use development, transit, and historic preservation.   The city's efforts to revitalize its core and protect its historic character now have radiated beyond the boundaries of downtown. According to former Mayor Wellington Webb, who stepped down after three terms in 2003, ""In downtown Denver, our history ... exists comfortably and proudly side by side with our present."" Webb convened two major summits to look at how to integrate business development, transportation, housing, and historic preservation in downtown. Under his leadership, the city made sweeping changes to its zoning to encourage housing and transit-oriented development in the central business district. The city also established an office specifically to market its inventory of historic and older downtown buildings to housing developers, providing developers and investors with accurate information about properties and market conditions.   The latest manifestation of Denver's efforts to protect and enhance its downtown is Blueprint Denver, which was approved by the City Council in March 2002 by a vote of 11 to l. Blueprint Denver seeks to confront the major planning issues associated with integrating land use and transportation planning -- the first step to sound growth management.    Image: REI skillfully restored and adapted the historic Denver Tramway Power Company Building for use as its Denver flagship store.     BLUEPRINT DENVER   Blueprint Denver identifies areas of stability and areas of change where growth and transit investment can be channeled to improve access to jobs, housing, and services while decreasing auto trips. Downtown Denver is an area of change and its population could grow by 30 percent during the next 20 years. Areas of stability in the plan are primarily established residential neighborhoods and their associated commercial areas. City planners have asked Denver's 77 neighborhoods to develop their own mini-blueprints. The goal of planning for these areas of stability is to let them identify and maintain their particular character while accommodating new development and redevelopment.   A focal point of Blueprint Denver's transportation strategy is to support transit-oriented development (TOD) at existing and planned stations on light-rail lines serving the city. The strategy is designed to preserve historic neighborhoods and reuse historic and architecturally significant downtown buildings. Historic buildings of the type found in downtown Denver -- mostly old warehouses and industrial/commercial spaces -- are ideally suited to retail, office space, and condo- or apartment-style housing. The city makes financing available for unconventional housing projects, and is directing its private activity bond allocations toward housing.    ""My first Downtown Summit in 1991 rallied city government and preservation and business constituencies to closer collaboration on two principal strategies: developing housing and expanding historic preservation as an economic development tool."" WELLINGTON WEBB MAYOR OF DENVER    Rehabilitation of historic buildings for housing has been underway in Denver for many years. Mayor Webb supported this effort, believing that the city's revitalization depends on establishing a residential population downtown. A mainstay of Webb's strategy was to emphasize transit access and walkable streets while controlling additional downtown parking.   Although Blueprint Denver does not change zoning, it sets in motion a process for a substantial revision of Denver's zoning code, which is essential to the plan's success and crucial to the achievement of regional transportation objectives.    PARTNERS AND LEADERS   Blueprint Denver was assembled with extensive participation by the city's transportation agency, members of the council, 46 members of an advisory committee, and many hundreds of other Denver citizens who appeared at public hearings, open houses in each of the 13 council districts, and neighborhood discussions.   Denver has a seven-county Regional Transportation District (RTD) with bonding authority to improve, maintain, and operate Denver's mass transit system. The RTD works with the region's metropolitan planning organization, the Denver Regional Council of Governments. The RTD recently took the lead in encouraging TOD by establishing a ""TOD shop"" to help developers move their projects along.    Two private nonprofit groups have been closely involved in shaping both Denver's historic preservation and its transit future: Historic Denver, Inc. (HDI) and the Downtown Denver Partnership, Inc. (DDP). HDI was founded by citizens in 1970 and has focused much of its attention on preservation of the urban core and close-in neighborhoods. DDP has represented downtown businesses, property owners, and employees since 1955, and has long advocated for transportation choices that support revitalization and historic preservation. DDP supports the region's current transit planning and the redevelopment of Union Station into an intermodal center.   The city has also been blessed with two mayors who placed priority on transit-oriented and preservation-minded revitalization downtown. In 1984 Mayor Federico Peña convened a committee of civic and business leaders to help plan the city's future. The committee and the mayor's sustained leadership were instrumental in designating Lower Downtown a historic district in 1988. Mayor Peña declared Lower Downtown the best opportunity for jump-starting the revitalization of downtown Denver, and made downtown historic district designation the number one issue for the city, backed by an extensive coalition of supporters.    TRANSPORTATION CHOICES   According to Jennifer Moulton, former director of the Community Planning and Development Agency, the objectives of Blueprint Denver are not only implementation of light rail along well-planned corridors, but also improved bus service, special highway High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, commuter rail, and improved street design for walking and bicycling. The plan stresses the importance of residential and commercial activities near major transit stops.   The city's mass transit system includes more than 16 miles of light rail, the first segment of which began operation in 1994, and will total 35 miles on completion. Nearly 200 bus routes run throughout the region, serving 64 free park-and-rides and hundreds of bus stops. More than 65 bus trips per hour arrive in downtown Denver during peak periods.   Metropolitan Denver's Transportation Expansion Project (T-Rex), a $1.7 billion undertaking, consists of new light rail transit and highway improvements on I-25 between Denver and major destinations to the southeast of the city. T-Rex will reconstruct 17 miles of I-25, including bridges and interchanges, and is constructing 19 miles of double-track light rail with 13 transit stations in the Southeast Corridor to Douglas County, with a spur along I-225 in Arapahoe County. RTD and the Federal Transit Administration entered into a Full Funding Grant Agreement in November 2000, which committed $525 million in Section 5309 New Starts funds to the project.   Waiting in the wings for voter approval is RTD's accelerated 10-year plan that proposes to spend $4.3 billion for light rail, commuter rail, and express bus lanes in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD also proposes to double the number of parking spaces at stations along the existing southwest line and to double parking spaces planned for the T-Rex line in southeast Denver. The plan is being called ""Fastrack"" and must be approved by metro-area voters because of the 0.4 percent sales tax hike needed to help pay for it. It is likely to be on the ballot in 2004.    Image:  The magnificently restored Denver Dry Goods Building, a mixed-use project of the Jonathon Rose Companies, stands at the heart of multi-modal downtown Denver. The restoration took advantage of 23 sources of financing.    PROTECTING DENVER'S INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS   Beginning in the early 1990s, large second-story additions or ""pop-tops"" became common in Denver's historic inner-city neighborhoods as owners sought ways to expand the typical two-bedroom Denver bungalow. This phenomenon of tear-downs or scrape-offs has become commonplace across the United States, and large suburban-style homes are replacing historic bungalows all over the nation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation attempted to draw national attention to the phenomenon by placing Teardowns on its 2002 List of America's Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places.   The zoning in many neighborhoods surrounding Denver's central business district permits much greater density than is currently in place. High-rise apartments and condominiums could destroy the character of the inner city's historic residential neighborhoods, with a density growth well above what existing residents are willing to tolerate. Blueprint Denver acknowledges that zoning in these areas of stability must be changed, and the city is working to effect these changes.   Blueprint Denver also envisions that the city's 77 neighborhoods will develop their own mini-blueprints. In some neighborhoods, local historic districts are being proposed. Along with stronger protections to prevent demolitions and out-of-scale additions, the advocates for these historic neighborhoods will also help identify appropriate infill sites and develop flexible guidelines to encourage compatible new construction.   Residents and preservationists in Denver have been successful in protecting the high-quality architecture, mature landscaping, and pedestrian orientation of traditional, historic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods radiate a powerful sense of place that benefits the city in terms of consumer reinvestment, community stability, and tourism.   The Denver Downtown Partnership has provided an overview of residential areas of downtown and some of Denver's close-in neighborhoods, some of which is quoted here.    DOWNTOWN: AREA OF CHANGE   There is a common perception that the majority of downtown Denver's housing growth during the 1990s happened in Lower Downtown. However, the rate of residential growth in the upper end of downtown -- in what is often referred to as the central business district -- has been on par with that of Lower Downtown. Upper Downtown has a population of approximately 3,000 people, while Lower Downtown's population is about 2,200.   In recent years, several vacant office buildings in the central business district of downtown Denver have been renovated into apartment and condominium projects along 15th, 16th, and 17th streets -- Baldwin Lofts, the Denver Dry Goods Building Lofts, the A.T. Lewis & Rio Grande Lofts, Boston Lofts, and Bank Lofts. Four of these projects include below-market-rate apartments for downtown's workforce. Two recent developments on Champa Street include the Buerger Brothers Industrial Lofts and the Chamber Apartments next door. The upper end of Downtown now has approximately 1,550 rental units and 650 for-sale units.    LOWER DOWNTOWN: AREA OF CHANGE   Lower Downtown -- or LoDo, as it is commonly called -- is in the oldest part of Denver, founded in 1858 by General William Larimer. Today LoDo is a vibrant 25-block urban neighborhood comprised of brick warehouses, industrial buildings and commercial structures that have been renovated into offices, lofts and retail space.   LoDo housing options range from million-dollar lofts to below-market rate apartments. New construction for housing has begun as the number of vacant buildings in Lower Downtown available for renovation shrinks to nearly zero.   The most notable construction projects in Lower Downtown are four new office buildings that were recently built on the former sites of surface parking lots. One of these developments -- 16 Market Square -- includes 25 residential lofts on its top floors.    DENVER INVESTS IN INTERMODALISM: UNION TERMINAL   Denver's Regional Transportation District (RTD) purchased Union Station in August 2001, along with 20 acres of adjacent prime real estate for just under $50 million, after about a year of intense negotiations with the station's three owners. The century-old rail facility, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, ranks among Denver's outstanding historic structures. It will become the heart and hub of a regional, multimodal transportation system and a premier destination in its own right in the midst of all sorts of destinations.    RTD's financial partners in the purchase are the City and County of Denver, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments that, along with the Colorado Department of Transportation, approved $23 million in federal funds. An impressive team, dubbed the Union Station Alliance, was assembled to develop a master plan for the depot and the surrounding 18.5 acres of land in accord with a multi-modal transportation vision that includes light rail, commuter rail, Amtrak, local and regional buses, the 16th Street mall shuttle, bicycle facilities, and taxi cab facilities.    The terminal will become the gateway to Denver, just as it was years ago when as many as 80 passenger trains pulled in each day. In an interview with the Denver Business Journal, Jennifer Moulton, the city's former planning director, called it Denver's ""front door"". A rail line to Denver International Airport, currently served by RTD buses to downtown, will be a part of the planning, as well as a link to the nearby Platte River Trolley, with its antique street cars.    CENTRAL PLATTE VALLEY: AREA OF CHANGE   The Central Platte Valley neighborhood is largely a blank slate at this time, a 120-acre expanse to the west of downtown Denver that is home to about 360 residential units. After spending most of this century marked by railyards, warehouses, viaducts, and garbage dumps, the Central Platte Valley area is evolving into an exciting, mixed-use urban neighborhood with more than 2,000 housing units, and more than 3 million square feet of offices, shops, restaurants, and hotels. The first housing units between Union Station and the South Platte River are now occupied and more are under construction.   In 2001, shuttle service on the 16th Street Mall was extended through Lower Downtown and behind Union Station to the Central Platte Valley. The extension brings closer access to the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian span over the consolidated train track that remains in the Central Platte Valley. Central Platte Valley's residents have a 10-minute walk into Lower Downtown and Denver's central business district.   To enhance access in the area, there are plans to develop an intermodal facility that handles passenger trains, regional buses, light rail, and commuter rail, creating a downtown hub for Denver's metropolitan transportation system. A 1.5-mile light rail spur recently began operating in Central Platte Valley, linking the Auraria Higher Education Center and downtown, with stops at entertainment destinations (such as the Pepsi Center) and future housing and commercial developments.   Although the land on the east side of the South Platte River is now taking shape with the first phase of development, the west side of the Central Platte Valley between the river and I-25 has characteristic red-brick buildings with ground-floor retail and restaurants and residential lofts above. Commons Park West, a new construction 340-unit apartment complex, is the largest of recent developments.    Signs of success   In 1991 downtown Denver was full of boarded-up buildings. Today, more than 50 formerly derelict structures have been put back in service, mostly as downtown housing. The downtown has attracted $158 million in investment for historic preservation alone, including only $16 million in public funds. Virtually all of downtown Denver is already transit-oriented development.   More than 10 percent of the metropolitan region's workforce is employed in downtown Denver. Almost half of those workers commute to downtown via transit, carpooling, or other alternatives to driving. And 54,000 people use the 16th Street Transit Mall every weekday.   Construction of new residences and population have increased in and near downtown during the past decade -- the population of Lower Downtown alone doubled from about 1,000 mostly low-income residents in 1990 to about 2,500 with a much higher median income in 2000. The downtown's revenue base has also improved: Denver is the 20th largest city in the country but has the 10th largest downtown in terms of commercial and retail space.   For the most part, the neighborhoods near downtown have not experienced the cycles of serious disinvestment that usually plague inner-city neighborhoods in other communities. Denver's core neighborhoods, especially the historic ones, are increasingly popular among home buyers. More than 67,000 people live within a one mile radius of downtown in these neighborhoods. Prices are rising, with the result that the inner-ring neighborhoods are endangered by their own success. Many newcomers to the city's historic neighborhoods are altering or demolishing homes to build suburban-style dwellings with larger amounts of square footage. Through zoning controls and the Blueprint Denver effort, the city is moving decisively to support preservation of the scale and character of neighborhoods in and near downtown (see ""Protecting Denver's Inner-City Neighborhoods,"" page 27).    Lessons learned   • Build on previous efforts and successes in historic preservation, housing, transportation, and downtown revitalization.  Denver is drawing on a rich history of such efforts to bring in stake-holders and create new models for wedding transportation choices and sustainable development downtown.   • Promote individual leadership, and give credit where credit is due.  Without the early efforts of developers like Dana Crawford and preservationists like Lisa Purdy, and without the leadership and vision of Mayors Federico Pena and Wellington Webb, Denver's downtown might never have become the crown jewel it is today.   • Coordinate downtown efforts within a regional framework.  Planning and financial mechanisms are needed at a regional level to create, improve, and sustain a living downtown. Denver recognized this lesson in its early efforts to create a Lower Downtown historic district.

Although the city has made remarkable progress in offering transportation choices and a downtown design to support them, San Diego still struggles to develop employment and residential population in its center city and older, close-in neighborhoods. In a city renowned both for its excellent planning and its unique character, historic preservation has not become a serious organizing principle for revitalization efforts. Yet the benefits of historic preservation to the city are everywhere apparent.   San Diego was the first city on the West Coast to electrify its trolleys, and among the first to respond broadly to the problems our auto-dependent society has inflicted upon cities. The city reused old rail rights-of-way to create a new trolley system in the 1970s. Because these routes link historically significant destinations that still define the community's character today, San Diego's historic places are uniquely positioned to contribute to smart growth.   A major planning effort for the city, the City of Villages, could have a profound impact on historic resources in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. The San Diego Association of Governments, the metropolitan planning organization, estimates that the city's population will increase approximately 284,000 by 2020 and an additional 150,000 homes will be needed to house new residents. City of Villages was San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy's fundamental policy response to the land shortage and housing needs. The intent of City of Villages is to concentrate much of the needed growth in the city's established neighborhoods. Less than 10 percent of San Diego's 331 square miles is still raw, developable land. Additional housing has to compete with other demands in neighborhoods that want to control levels of density and congestion, address deteriorating public infrastructure, stimulate and maintain community services, and create attractive public spaces.   The City of Villages planning process has led downtown and neighborhood leaders to take a long look at the city core's needs and special character, and has prompted both the city and the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) to consider ways to boost transit's contribution to downtown revitalization. Although City of Villages acknowledges the importance of neighborhood and civic character, historic resources, and transit-oriented design, historic preservation is not a fundamental pillar for planning.   Specific development projects may point the way toward a greater reliance on historic preservation as a means to smart growth and revitalization, at least in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. For example, construction of a new baseball park for the San Diego Padres illustrates the benefits of historic preservation to downtown revitalization and public transportation (see ""The Ballpark District,"" page 36). The new ballpark is located in a promising area of historic warehouses, adjacent to the city's world-renowned Gaslamp Quarter, a National Historic District.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Founded on a site that had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years, including the La Jolla, Yuman, and Shoshonean, San Diego became a Spanish mission in 1602. The first colonists arrived 175 years later, including military families from the coastal fortress known as the Presidio. In the 1840s Americans gained a foothold in San Diego as a result of the winning of California by the United States and the 1848 gold rush. In 1850 downtown San Diego was established as New Town and the city was incorporated. Today the military and the Catholic Church are still active participants in San Diego's economy and culture, linking the city to its colonial past.   San Diego's transit history reaches back to the 1870s. Initially horsepowered, later expanded and electrified, the trolley system gave way to buses in the middle of the last century. The city's walkable downtown declined in proportion to suburban expansion, until by the late 1960s, downtown properties were not even generating enough tax revenue to cover basic city services.   In 1972, then-Mayor Pete Wilson outlined an aggressive program for revitalizing the physically and economically blighted downtown. Public and private redevelopment organizations pursued a plan to bring residents, retail, and commercial businesses back to downtown; create a strong job base; and reestablish downtown's premier role as a lively and attractive regional hub for employment, services, arts, culture, government, entertainment, and living.   The rebirth of the San Diego Trolley in the 1970s and the civic commitment to downtown revitalization advanced concurrently, one contributing to the success of the other. Downtown redevelopment required that the area be accessible from throughout the region, and light rail transit offered an additional travel choice reminiscent of days gone by. San Diego's historic and very popular Gaslamp Quarter was one of the earlier community revitalization efforts that helped to establish the role of historic preservation in the redevelopment plan.   Image: Outstanding restorations of the Gaslamp Quarter's historic buildings shape the area's character and contribute to its walkability.    TRANSPORTATION   In the 1970s California State Senator John Mills, a transit visionary and ardent historic preservationist, was instrumental in passing state legislation to bring light rail back to San Diego. The legislation created two revenue streams for light rail: a quarter-cent state sales tax rebated to local governments, and constitutional access to state gasoline taxes. The legislation also created the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) to design and build the system.   The statute gave MDTB just five years to get the system up and running. With $18 million, MTDB quickly purchased 108 miles of existing railroad track, 32 miles of which became the first segments of the Blue and Orange lines. The new light rail system's initial segment was built with $12 million of state funds and $74 million from local sources.   The trolley system has been expanding ever since. The newest six-mile segment, the Mission Valley East LRT Extension, will provide access to major employment and activity destinations such as San Diego State University (SDSU) and the Alvarado Medical Center. The extension will also complete a northern outer loop by linking up the existing Blue and Orange lines.   Over 24,000 jobs and 10,000 residences are within walking distance of the extension's proposed stations. Current zoning is generally supportive of transit. Total capital costs for this extension are estimated at $431 million, including $330 million in Federal Transit Administration New Start Funds. Costs reflect construction of a 4,000-foot tunnel, an underground station 60 feet below the SDSU campus, and other features such as access to multiple destinations, park-and-ride lots, and road and pedestrian improvements.   The Metropolitan Transit Development Board has been promoting transit-oriented, joint-development projects from its earliest days. By 1985 MTDB was able to examine its experience with joint development and draw early conclusions, including a realization that transit-supportive development in the vicinity of light rail was not going to be a naturally occurring phenomenon, especially along existing rights-of-way.   Since MTDB did not own substantial amounts of developable land at its stations, joint ventures with adjacent land owners made sense. Success would depend on supportive public policies and an understanding of the needs of private developers who were willing to participate. Small-scale joint developments were worth pursuing because they generated revenues, provided visibility, and tended to make station areas more attractive to riders. Agreements among local governments were made easier by the fact that MTDB board members are locally elected officials from its entire service area.   To make transit more relevant to the region's population, the MTDB undertook TransitWorks, a market-based strategic planning program developed over a two-year period. Through extensive study of the attitudes and preferences that determine San Diego residents' travel choices, MTDB sought to understand individual decision making about transportation, to classify travelers into groups based on common attitudes and travel preferences, and to better understand the trade-offs travelers make when considering transit for different kinds of trips.   The TransitWorks exercise identified the service characteristics needed to attract new riders, and devised four different service concepts from short, neighborhood-level trips to trips of more than six miles. The process then developed a series of scenarios on the basis of how extensive service would have to be in order to attract different market segments. Cost estimates for each scenario were provided.   Image: San Diego Trolley stops bracket the city's Gaslamp Quarter and offer visitors travel choices.   The fourth scenario, labeled ""Transit First,"" envisions the San Diego region finally curbing its appetite for consuming land by more careful attention to the design of new development. Trolley service has been improved and expanded, and many areas are served by a network of bus rapid transit routes fed by a web of community and neighborhood transit connections. New services have focused on key employment sites, especially where auto congestion impedes the ability of employees to get to work. In the old and new neighborhoods, especially where improved pedestrian access exists, the potential for transit use has been enhanced because a high percentage of residents are able and willing to walk to stops.   The Metropolitan Transit Development Board estimates that implementation of Transit First could cost as much as $6.8 billion and acknowledges that much depends on taxpayers' assent to an extension of TransNet, the region's half percent sales tax for transportation, which expires in 2008. The Transit First option is being supported by the coordinated actions of the City of San Diego in implementing the City of Villages transit-oriented development plan.    CITY OF VILLAGES PLAN   City of Villages is designed to accommodate and channel future growth and address critical urban public policy issues such as affordable housing, traffic congestion, aging community infrastructure, public facilities, and land use. San Diego planners and a 40-member citizens committee managed an extensive public involvement process, including 150 public meetings and various workshops that led to a growth management strategy for over 40 of San Diego's neighborhoods.   At its heart, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the plan is a civic compact between local government officials and the citizens of the neighborhoods to accept more growth in the form of housing, shops, and offices concentrated into mixed-use developments in exchange for the city's commitment to deliver $2.5 billion worth of better community infrastructure, including sidewalks, public spaces, parks, libraries, and other long-sought public improvements.   Image: Attractive gateways into the Gaslamp Quarter enhance good walking streets.   City of Villages is also a blueprint for neighborhood revitalization that envisions places for many more people to live in mixed-use, mixed-income livable communities. The plan identifies the major features of great places: preservation of neighborhood character, historic and cultural resources, pedestrian-friendly streets and sidewalks, easy and safe access to transit, jobs, neighborhood amenities, public and commercial services, calmed traffic, and parking management plans.   According to Gail Goldberg, San Diego's planning director, the dialogue with neighborhoods was less about growth than it was about how to harness growth to attract amenities that were lacking in many older neighborhoods, such as transit, services, and civic spaces.   No one believes that the City of Villages strategy is going to be easy to implement. Lack of financial resources presents an obstacle that will call for public revenue increases to be put before the city's voters. Residents will be called upon to accept appropriate increases in density. California state law contains many obsolete barriers to implementation of smart growth principles that must be overcome, including how to successfully integrate community planning and school siting functions. City of Villages assumes that transit services will be an important implementation ingredient in the overall strategy.   For its part, MTDB is working to implement a Transit First pilot project that will provide service in much-traveled corridors that feature some of the city's recently short-listed City of Villages Pilot projects. The Transit First Showcase Project will provide residents of North Park, City Heights, and the College area with high-quality, rubber-tired transit connecting downtown San Diego to San Diego State University (SDSU) along Park and El Cajon Boulevards. This new kind of transit will offer the speed, comfort, and amenities of a trolley. Riders will be able to bypass traffic congestion because transit will travel in its own lanes and receive priority at signalized intersections. Stations will include upgraded shelters, passenger information and other features. New technology will allow passengers to pay for fares with debit cards (Smart Cards) and to know when the next transit vehicle will arrive. MTDB is also working to encourage transit-oriented development around 15 trolley stations.    DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO   San Diego's pedestrian-friendly central business district is well served by trolley and buses, but transit and redevelopment agencies are examining additional access and mobility options as they prepare for downtown's participation in the region's City of Villages program. The central business district is the most promising part of the region for an early City of Villages success. The presence of multimodal public transit-including two light rail lines, commuter rail, Amtrak, and many bus routes-along with limits on parking, Transportation Demand Management measures, regional destinations, and mixed land uses in a pedestrian-oriented setting, combine to make San Diego's center city a 1,500-acre transit-oriented development.    Downtown San Diego has the region's greatest concentration of significant historic structures and an emerging awareness of the role such structures are playing, not only as adaptively reused buildings where people live, work, shop, and enjoy recreation, but also as places that contribute to the unique character of downtown San Diego and to its irreplaceable sense of place. Breathtaking historic restorations abound in center city, and many more are under construction or on the drawing board. The region is particularly blessed with first-rate historic attractions, most of which are connected to one another by San Diego's public transit system.    Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC), downtown's redevelopment agency, embarked on a Downtown Community Plan Update in 1992 that helped build the framework for center city's participation in City of Villages. The findings of CCDCs ambitious public outreach effort will be familiar to mayors, city councils, and urban planners everywhere in the United States:    • Is the central business district to be the region's major employment center, while still maintaining its historic, mixed-use character? If so, is the city at risk by devoting too much land to housing?  • Are housing initiatives providing enough opportunity and encouragement to bring families downtown?  • What about nearby amenities and commercial services for residents so that auto trips can be reduced?  • What about schools, parks, parking, services for the poor and homeless, affordable housing, and the amenities and attractions that bring so many tourists and conventioneers (and their money) to San Diego?  • Does the city need more light rail downtown, a transit mall, a shuttle to major destinations, and does it have the right mix of transportation choices?  • Is center city as pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly as it ought to be?  • Is the private auto going to receive equal billing with public transit?    Largely missing from these discussions was conscious consideration for the historic context of San Diego as a contributor to downtown and transportation revitalization -- not only the buildings and sites themselves, but the very street grids and pedestrian scale that make downtown San Diego so well-suited to transit. Despite the lack of discussion, many of San Diego' s efforts ""on the ground"" are affirming the link between historic areas and transit-supportive development.    The rail right-of-way purchased for the San Diego Trolley downtown connects many of the city's architecturally significant buildings. Restoration of historic structures is contributing substantially to transit-supportive development. Many of the mixed-use development projects planned and underway in the center city are careful restorations, adhering to the Secretary of Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and generating federal income tax credits for their developers.    NORTH PARK NEIGHBORHOOD   San Diego's North Park neighborhood is located about four miles northeast of downtown, past the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park. Racially and ethnically diverse, North Park is home to about 50,000 people, and its design reflects its past as a classic older, urban streetcar neighborhood. Of the 22 businesses in the centermost block of North Park's commercial district, 15 are owned by individuals of different nationalities. The neighborhood's median family income is about $10,000 below the citywide median.    North Park's distinctive and treasured architectural gems are located along or near the older commercial sections of University Avenue. The neighborhood also boasts a large and notable collection of single- and double-story homes typifying the design and construction methods of the American Arts and Crafts movement of the early 20th century. Throughout North Park there is a diverse collection of California Bungalow, Prairie School, and Period Revival homes built between 1918 and 1941.   Image: The exquisitely restored Louis Bank of Commerce Building graces 5th Avenue in the Gaslamp Quarter    In 1996, North Park became the first Main Street program in the city of San Diego. The National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Center is a comprehensive self-help process for revitalizing historic and traditional commercial districts in communities of all sizes and economic conditions. In keeping with Main Street's Four-Point Approach, North Park Main Street has been promoting economic and community revitalization by concentrating on physical improvements, strengthening organizational capabilities, promoting its assets and advantages, and building up the economic vitality of the community.    North Park Main Street partnered with San Diego's planning agency to develop a comprehensive planning proposal entitled the North Park Transit Village Project. The key components of the plan are to restore and maintain North Park's historic transit and pedestrian environment, fully revitalize the University Avenue business district, improve public transit, calm traffic, and make University Avenue itself safe for pedestrians and bicyclists. North Park Main Street is also enthusiastically advocating for the restoration of the historic Park Boulevard streetcar route from downtown San Diego to North Park, serving important destinations like the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park along the way. North Park Main Street has even entered into an understanding with the owners of three remaining San Diego Class 1 streetcars from 1912 to pave the way for their restoration and reuse on the Park Boulevard route, should it be reestablished. The streetcar route was in service from 1907 to 1949 when it gave way to buses.    But the linchpin for North Park's participation in City of Villages is improving University Avenue on the one-mile segment from Interstate 805 on the east to Park Boulevard on the west, North Park's main street and one of the area's most dysfunctional arterials. The corridor is unsafe, congested, boasts the region's highest transit ridership, and is a major barrier for pedestrians because of inadequate crosswalks and excessive vehicle speeds. Nevertheless, North Park's many neighborhood organizations have long envisioned University Avenue as a pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use corridor, the redesign of which is essential to neighborhood revitalization.    To date, North Park has received $56,000 from the SANDAG Walkable Communities program and $14,000 in Community Development Block Grant Funds to perform preliminary design for University Avenue. The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) has provided $300,000 to further refine the planning and feasibility study for the conceptual plan.    North Parks vision defines transportation improvements as essential to the principal goal of City of Villages to provide more housing and job opportunities in existing neighborhoods. More homes and jobs will require zoning changes for higher density and mixed use redevelopment in the vicinity of the transit corridor, which in the case of North Park, is also the community's commercial district. More residents and more transit patrons should translate into more customers for Main Street businesses.    It has been said of San Diego that it is a place where everyone plans, and this is certainly true of North Park itself. The North Park Transit Village Project is designed to be consistent with SANDAG's Regional Transportation Plan, MTDB's TransitWorks, and San Diego's General Plan of which City of Villages is a part. There is a Greater North Park Planning Committee and a North Park Main Street Design Committee, which produced a paper in 2000 entitled  Destination North Park: Improving Transportation in North Park's University Avenue Corridor , to stimulate community conversation about comprehensive transportation investments to improve the University Avenue corridor.    North Park looks like older neighborhoods everywhere, underutilized and isolated by auto-dependent sprawl. Its old, intrinsic value as a walkable, mixed-use, mixed-income place is being reexamined, and the collection of woes that the auto age helped inflict upon North Park will be revisited in the process. University Avenue's conflicted personality as a main street-like commercial spine of an older neighborhood and a busy regional arterial will be one of the first items demanding analysis and healing.    THE BALLPARK DISTRICT   ""This project has always been more than a ballpark. We are creating a vibrant downtown neighborhood, and this agreement enables us to preserve some of the character of the area and incorporate it into the redevelopment of East Village in a way that is consistent with the history of this part of downtown."" LARRY LUCCHINO, FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SAN DIEGO PADRES    When San Diego voters approved a new ballpark for the Padres in 1998 in the East Village neighborhood near City Centre, a major controversy ensued over a variety of adverse impacts the ballpark and ancillary development plans would have on historic resources.   Working with San Diego's Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO), the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed the Arts and Warehouse District on its 1999 List of America's Most Endangered Historic Places to draw national attention to the potential loss and isolation of historic resources and to encourage San Diego and the Padres to look at alternatives that would keep the ballpark in Centre City and also save historic buildings slated for demolition in the original plan.   Discussions led to an agreement in September 1999 to save virtually all of the structures identified by preservationists as significant. Bruce Coons, SOHO's president, calls the new plan the best alternative available for preserving historic resources -- a unique and practical solution to the challenge of urban preservation.   San Diego Trolley's Orange and Blue Line stops at the East Village ballpark site, and many San Diego Transit bus routes provide direct and secondary access to the area as well as to the adjacent and recently expanded Convention Center and the highly popular Gaslamp Quarter.   San Diego has no minimum parking requirements in Centre City except for residential uses, and maximum parking limitations have been established for non-residential uses to reduce the parking supply downtown over time as a means to encourage the use of transit and car pooling. Additional parking for the ballpark and subsequent, phased redevelopment of the 26-block Ballpark District area featuring hotels, offices, retail, and residential space will be limited to approximately 4,000 spaces.   San Diego is preparing to mitigate anticipated parking shortages for weekday afternoon and weekend evening games by providing incentives, like transit passes, to encourage transit use by Ballpark service employees. Shuttle service to parking outside Centre City and incentives for greater trolley use by patrons during events will also be adopted.   In addition, San Diego is committed to two parking management plans prior to the first ballpark event, one for downtown and the other for residential neighborhoods adjacent to the ballpark. Attention is also being given to making it easier for patrons to walk to ballpark events.    ""Development and the preservation of historic resources do not have to be mutually exclusive."" RICHARD MOE, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION    Image: Transit-supported night life in downtown San Diego is a key feature of city revitalization.    Signs of success   It is too soon to judge the outcomes for San Diego's City of Villages initiative or the MTDB's Transit First strategy. However, the robustness of the San Diego transit system and the very fact that City of Villages is so urgently needed attest to the presence of crucial ingredients for success in downtown San Diego and its near-in neighborhoods.   The much-admired San Diego trolley system serves 30 million riders per year, complemented by a bus system that serves 55 million riders. It remains one of the most cost-efficient rail systems anywhere and is emulated by transportation planners worldwide.   San Diego's core remains a desirable place to live and work, although high rents and a housing shortage loom as serious challenges. Citizens have been active participants in the City of Villages process, attending more than 200 public meetings and workshops during the past five years to develop and refine the goals and objectives of the program. In May 2003, San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy announced seven finalists for the City of Villages pilot program, in which neighborhoods competed to receive financial and technical assistance toward development of transit-oriented development or redevelopment projects. Two of the finalists feature historic preservation or efforts to connect historic areas with newer developed areas. One of the finalists, the North Park Pilot Village, is featured on pages 34-35.     Lessons learned   •  When looking forward to accommodate growth, looking back helps too.  San Diego's past will play a critical role in its future and will continue to contribute to community revitalization and the success of public transit. Much of what San Diego wants for its future was present in its past: travel choices, density, mixed uses, walkability, attractive and accessible public places, interactive social and economic diversity, and efficient land use.   •  A transit agency need not be a landowner to be a serious partner in joint development around transit stations.  Because MTDB does not own substantial amounts of developable land at its stations, joint ventures with adjacent land owners have made sense for the agency's redevelopment of rail station areas since the 1970s. Success depends on supportive public policies and an understanding of the needs of private developers who are willing to participate. Small-scale joint developments have been worth pursuing because they generated revenues, provided visibility for the station, and tended to make station areas more attractive to riders. Agreements among local governments were made easier by the fact that MTDB board members are locally elected officials from its entire service area.

TRANSIT VILLAGES AND INTERMODAL CENTERS RECONNECT AND RESTORE COMMUNITIES   In their book  Transit Villages in the 21st Century  Michael Bernick and Robert Cervero call the San Francisco Bay Area ""arguably the epicenter of America's budding transit village movement, with a constituency of public officials, developers, and planners, along with several of the most visible 'new urbanist' architects and designers united in the cause of creating a new type of community and built form."" Although the Bay Area is widely known for its livability, coordination of land use and transportation planning, and the historic streetcar system in downtown San Francisco, the region has suffered its share of growing pains and serious missteps along the way to restoring a regional framework for transit.   The San Francisco Bay Area is served by four major rail systems: the San Francisco Municipal system (Muni), the CalTrain commuter system, Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). Muni operates San Francisco's beloved trolleys, many of which are historic and run along routes that are rich in historic resources. CalTrain carries 30,000 passengers a day from San Jose to San Francisco up the west side of the Bay through San Mateo County. VTA is a 10-year-old light rail system that serves Santa Clara County, primarily downtown San Jose, until the system is further expanded. BART is the 500-pound gorilla of the five-county Bay Area, a 30-year-old heavy rail system that will connect all five counties ringing San Francisco within the next decade.   BART's first 20 years yielded few success stories for transit-oriented development. Transportation engineers conducted planning and station site design with little consideration to land use or community character. Dan Solomon, a San Francisco architect and co-founder of the Congress for a New Urbanism, has called the typical BART station ""Fort BART, a killer of downtowns"" because the standard design surrounds a station with a surface parking lot and other features that physically disconnect stations from the communities they are supposed to serve. BART ""tore the heart out of the historic downtowns of many Bay Area cities,"" according to Solomon.   Over the past decade, BART has become more responsive to local planning, historic resources, and development issues. The system's officials now realize that cooperation with local government and community residents can boost ridership and improve the value of BART-owned property. In communities such as the Town of Hayward in Alameda County and the Fruitvale district of Oakland, BART is now helping correct the mistakes its planners made in the past. In San Jose, BART is working with local officials to enhance an already-vibrant downtown. Next to the San Jose downtown, the city and regional transportation officials are collaborating to create a world-class intermodal transportation center in a historic railroad depot, with a variety of nearby housing and employment choices in renovated historic structures and new infill developments.   According to Rod Diridon, a transportation expert who now chairs the Board of the California High Speed Rail Authority, ""Throughout the world, rail stations focus growth. This is particularly important in California, where the population is expected to double to 60 million by 2040. The state's investment in urban stations is paying high dividends in the preservation of settled neighborhoods and historic buildings. We are protecting the best of the past to create a better future.""    Image: The Diridon Station, located in the renovated 1935 Southern Pacific train depot, is an anchor for redevelopment in San Jose.    SAN JOSE DOWNTOWN   ""Light rail was the critical element in recreating a 'there, there' in San Jose's downtown. The system was the catalyst in bringing back that historic place,"" according to Robert Cervero. Dan Solomon calls downtown San Jose ""the single best example in the Bay Area of successful transit-oriented development.""   ""In reality, all downtown development in San Jose is transit-oriented development,"" says Dennis Korabiak, redevelopment program manager for the San Jose Redevelopment Agency. Notwithstanding the well-known deflation of the dot.com balloon and the substantial job and sales tax hits taken by Santa Clara County over the past two years, the Silicon Valley and its capital, San Jose, are alive and kicking. Transit, in all of its modes, may be the single most important reason.""    Image: Within the next decade, the Diridon Station will serve light rail, BART, and high-speed rail.    Following the classic downtown doldrums of the 1960s, caused by the usual culprits, Santa Clara County voters appeared to understand that transit is a necessary part of economic revival. On four separate occasions over the last 25 years, county voters have approved half-cent sales tax increases to fund transportation projects, most of them rail transit. The first increase in 1976 was approved by more than the requisite majority vote, and now brings in more than $130,000,000 per year.   In 1986 the first light rail line, the Guadalupe line, was completed by the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency (in 1995 the name was changed to the Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA). Although BART has still not made it to San Jose, the area is well served by a combination of bus, light rail, CalTrain commuter service to San Francisco, and other lines to such cities as Sacramento and Stockton.   In the ongoing efforts to create a new ""there, there"" in the historic downtown and other target neighborhoods, VTA has worked exceptionally closely with the political power structure, the San Jose Planning Department and Redevelopment Agency, and major landowners such as the San Jose Water Company. All agree on the need for high-density housing downtown, despite the economic downturn, and on transit-oriented development as an important tool for a vibrant downtown. In downtown San Jose the strategy has been paying off in a number of ways, including the preservation of historic structures such as the Jose Theater, built in 1906, where Harry Houdini performed and Charlie Chaplin is said to have made a personal appearance. The Jose went from mainstream movies to Spanish-language films as the population shifted, and then went dark. Although on the National Register, it was slated for demolition as part of a larger redevelopment project. At the prodding of the local Preservation Action Council, the Redevelopment Agency worked with the private developer (Jim Fox, the head of Saratoga Capital) to save the building, which required seismic retrofit, and retain it for the performing arts.   A larger project, New Century Commons, is an 1896 building that includes 26 rental apartments on two stories and a ground-floor retail space currently leased by Zanotto's, a grocery store. The building connects to the larger Century Center Apartments project, which consists of 89 rental units and 16,000 square feet of retail. The San Jose Redevelopment Agency contributed nearly half of the $25 million cost of the housing component.   The De Anza Hotel, another National Register building was rehabilitated by Jim Fox with $10.5 million in private investment, supplemented by substantial assistance from the city and historic tax credits that the developer calls ""indispensable."" The project was completed in 1989, with a 14-month construction period, following an extremely short 6-month approval process by the Landmarks Commission and City Council.   Other historic residential rehabs include the Twohy Building, a local landmark that now houses residential lofts above ground-floor retail; the three-story Security Building, built in 1890 and seismically retrofitted in 1996 by Barry Swenson Builders, with offices above ground-floor retail; and the Leticia Building, a historic renovation project with fully tenanted offices. Because of light rail access, the city required no parking for this and other similar projects.    SAN JOSE DIRIDON STATION   The Diridon Station, the anchor of a development area for which San Jose city leaders have high hopes, started life in 1935 as the Southern Pacific Train Depot. In relative disrepair, the station was sold by Southern Pacific to the state transportation and public works agency, CalTrans, in 1980, then sold again in 1990 to the regional Joint Powers Board, made up of representatives from Santa Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco Counties. During the 1990s it was rehabilitated with funding from CalTrans and VTA, and the parking lot was expanded. Placed on the National Register in 1993, the building was renovated in 1995. Upon completion, it was renamed Diridon Station, after Rod Diridon, a long-time member of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, one of the Bay Area's -- indeed the nation's --  foremost transportation experts. The station named for him can truly be said to be a model intermodal transportation terminal. Diridon Station is a hub for a dizzying array of services:   • the CalTrain San Jose/San Francisco commuter rail line;  • the Altamont Commuter Express, with daily trips between San Jose and Stockton;  • the Capitol Service intercity line run by Amtrak between San Jose and Sacramento;  • the Highway 17 Express feeder bus service to Santa Cruz, run by VTA and Amtrak; and  • the light rail Guadalupe line in downtown San Jose, run by the VTA.    Image: The historic Hyatt Sainte Claire Hotel faces out on San Jose's light rail line, along San Carlos Street.   Within the next decade, Diridon Station will also serve the following line expansions:   • the light rail expansion, currently under construction by VTA, which will connect to the Guadalupe line and extend to the City of Campbell (Southwest of San Jose), with completion scheduled for 2006;  • a long-discussed extension of the BART line from its current terminus in Fremont in the East Bay, through a tunnel under downtown San Jose, to Diridon Station. The line is in early design stage, with hoped-for completion in 2012; and  • High-speed rail from Los Angeles, projected for completion in 2012.   Jim Lightbody, deputy director for Transit Planning and Development at VTA, says, ""It is critical that VTA and the city have worked jointly to ensure that the area around the Diridon Station receives the right kind of development to reinforce the substantial public investment in transit.""   The present and planned transit use of the Diridon Station, together with the nearby multi-use arena, has sparked a substantial planning effort by the City of San Jose, several mixed-use private developments, and a rezoning proposal by the largest land-owner in the sector, the San Jose Water Company.   With the assistance of the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, VTA recently completed the final draft of a strategic plan to guide the long-term development of the Diridon station area. The plan covers more than 64 acres, representing 4 million square feet of commercial space and 2 million square feet of residential space in 1,800 housing units. The plan considers and coordinates a number of recent and current planning efforts, including the San Jose 2020 General Plan, the Midtown Specific Plan, Strategy 2000: Greater Downtown Strategy for Development, the Guadalupe River Park Master Plan, and the Delmas Park Neighborhood Improvement Plan. The station area's future would be guided by two major factors. First, the extensive transportation investments in downtown San Jose could make the city ""the most important transit hub in the Bay Area."" Second, demand for commercial office and high-density residential space remains strong in downtown San Jose, despite the economic downturn. The continued intensification of uses in the downtown area ""provides the opportunity to reinforce the attractiveness of this urban center as a place to work and live,"" according to Strategy 2000. In particular, the plan states that the Diridon Station area ""will be the most direct expansion zone for downtown and will enjoy high accessibility to a wide range of transit and the intermodal transit center [and] is therefore suited to the highest-density commercial office/mixed use development pattern, with a strong emphasis on lively pedestrian activity, entertainment uses, and a vibrant mix of local and national retail.""   The plan specifies architectural excellence and historic preservation as part of a successful planning strategy, directing the community to ""create an icon of Silicon Valley, with landmark architecture, retail and entertainment facilities, and civic and cultural space ... [and] enhance the existing urban and natural setting with reasonably scaled, environmentally responsible, pedestrian-oriented urbanism.""   These are lofty goals, but already supported by the evident interest of private developers, as well as initial successes in the station area. Immediately across the tracks to the west of the station, the Castle Company has begun preliminary site work and toxic clean-up on the southern portion of a two-block high-density residential project that will feature 150 new condominium units. The second phase of the project includes the historic brick Del Monte cannery, which will be rehabilitated into 200 high-end condominiums.   Two blocks east of the Diridon Station, across the street from the arena, is an eight-acre parcel owned by the SJW Land Company, the real estate subsidiary of the San Jose Water Company. The land has been owned by the company for 50 years and is the site of their headquarters building, a 20,000-square-foot, two-story Spanish-style building on the National Register that will be incorporated into the company's proposed new development. The company has requested a zoning change to permit redevelopment of the parcel to include 350,000 square feet (364 units) of residential; 1,000,000 square feet of commercial; and up to 50,000 square feet of retail. The company hasn't decided whether to enter into a joint venture, develop the project alone, or pursue some other financing structure. Janelle McCombs, director of real estate for SJW, says the time is now ripe to seek approval for an ambitious planned development for the property: ""We see this as a long-term strategic play. We are extremely optimistic about the future of the Diridon Station area. The station is clearly a major transportation hub that enhances our project, which in turn enhances the transportation hub.""    FRUITVALE DISTRICT, OAKLAND   The Fruitvale district is the principal Latino community of the City of Oakland. Until the 1960s, the major shopping street in the community was East 14th Street, which was so popular it was known as ""the second downtown of Oakland."" The construction of huge regional shopping malls and discount centers undermined East 14th so much that by the 1990s, the street's retail vacancy rate had risen to 50 percent. Street crime, drug traffic, and disinvestment increased. A major job provider, the Del Monte Cannery, closed its doors.   Although the introduction of BART service to Fruitvale in the 1970s had greatly improved transit access to the area -- the station is the destination for nine bus lines traveling along East 14th Street, now known as International Boulevard -- BART's introduction also siphoned stable residents away to the far East Bay suburbs, where housing was cheaper. BART razed homes and stores to make way for the Fruitvale station, which was situated to literally turn its back on the community. The area around the station was lifeless. Passengers hurried to their cars and sped away.   Enter the Unity Council (formerly known as the Spanish-Speaking Unity Council), led by Arabella Martinez and Manuela Silva. The Council created the Fruitvale Development Corporation and Fruitvale Main Street program in the early 1990s to craft a remarkable turnaround for the neighborhood. Their efforts were so impressive, their early achievements so dramatic, their persuasive abilities and creative financing moves so stunning, that a new term should be coined to describe their approach: perhaps community instigation, rather than just involvement.   In 1992 the City of Oakland changed the name of historic East 14th Street to International Boulevard. The Unity Council worked with newly-elected City Councilman Ignacio de la Fuente to obtain $185,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds for an ambitious program of store façade improvements, park and playground upgrading, graffiti removal, street lighting, and tree planting. The Council also used the funds to establish a neighborhood watch program that hectored and hassled drug dealers and adult bookstore and strip club operators until they folded their tents.   The Council also undertook efforts to rehabilitate older buildings and bring in private investors. The Council purchased the historic Masonic Temple for renovation and use as a community center. In 1993, the Council and Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris invited Transportation Secretary Federico Peña to Fruitvale. Peña arrived with a check for $470,000 to continue the International Boulevard renovation and to provide initial pre-development funding for the Fruitvale Transit Village.    FRUITVALE TRANSIT VILLAGE   When Martinez and Silva first conceived of a development project to bring back International Boulevard, they did not intend it to be transit-oriented. They simply wanted to develop a mixed-use project that would include multifamily housing for mixed income levels. The Unity Council did not envision a direct link to transit until BART unwittingly presented a golden opportunity in the form of a proposed 500-car parking garage in 1991.   The garage was to be sited in such a way as to further separate the BART station from the Fruitvale community and International Boulevard (then still known as East 14th Street). Although BART held initial public hearings as required under the environmental impact assessment process, local citizens were not really made aware of the problems the garage posed to the community. Martinez and Silva realized the danger and marshaled strong community objections at the final public hearings. Citizens did not oppose the parking garage itself, but rather the lack of focus on the Fruitvale community and its goals. The project was stalled until a better solution could be found.   BART, including members of the BART board and staff members such as Jeff Ordway and his colleagues in the BART Property Development Office, responded positively to the community's concerns. In the meantime, the Council took some steps to establish momentum for a completely fresh approach to the main commercial corridor.   The Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC) owned nearby property it had earlier purchased from the Union Pacific Railway. BART agreed to take this property for its garage, in exchange for which FDC would take out a 95-year lease on the original BART site, on which to build the mixed-use Fruitvale Transit Village to provide a strong physical link to International Boulevard.   Phase I of the project consists of some 255,000 square feet and will cost approximately $65,000,000. The design, by architect Ernesto Vasquez, features 47 units of housing above 38,000 square feet of retail shops, restaurants, and a traditional mercado, or market plaza. Community resources will total 63,000 square feet and will include the headquarters of the Unity Council, the Cesar Chavez Public Library, childcare and senior centers, and a public plaza in front of the station, with a tree-lined pedestrian walkway to International Boulevard. Importantly, the project will also include La Clinica de la Raza Medical Center, a 47,000-square-foot outpatient and preventive care facility serving 15,000 families.   The financing of the Fruitvale Transit Village is an extraordinary blending of 501(c)(3) bond debt, enhanced by Citibank ($20,000,000) and grants from every governmental and foundation source imaginable, both local and national, from the Levi Strauss Foundation to the Ford Foundation, from a local library bond issue to grants from at least five federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation, EPA, the Federal Transit Administration, and even the Federal Emergency Management Administration.   In addition to the first phase of the Transit Village, the project team used $6,500,000 in HUD grants and city loans to develop an adjacent senior citizen housing project. This second phase of the Village, currently in the planning stage, is to include 200 units of housing and 30,000 square feet of commercial uses.   Image: The proposed Fruitvale Transit Village features a traditional mercado, or market plaza, and new retail, restaurants, and housing, all easily accessible to transit.    CITY OF HAYWARD   Hayward is located in Alameda County in the East Bay. As with thousands of small cities across the country, Hayward's once-vigorous downtown was dealt a mortal blow in mid-century, principally by the advent of several large shopping malls and discount warehouses nearby. Jesus Armas, city manager for Hayward, says, ""The 1960s and 1970s saw a gradual and consistent decline in our downtown, aided and abetted by Proposition 13,"" the statewide ballot measure that passed in 1978, severely restricting property tax revenues.   The area between the BART station and downtown Hayward was declared a redevelopment area in 1985. With no tax increment financing in view yet, city officials had to choose their renewal efforts very carefully. Should redevelopment be focused on the old major shopping street, Foothill Boulevard, or around the BART station, three blocks to the west? Although the station was surrounded by surface parking lots, an auto dealership, and other low-level industrial uses, access to BART was strengthened by the inclusion of Alameda County Transit buses and a nearby Greyhound terminal. The city chose the station area, bought a large private parcel which they leased to BART for additional parking, and hired architect Dan Solomon to do a ""recentering"" plan to connect the station to the historic downtown. Solomon proposed tying the two sectors together with multifamily housing, retail uses, and a civic plaza. Although the city was not financially able to take serious steps to implement the plan, the seeds for revitalization were planted.   After Armas became city manager in 1993, the Hayward Redevelopment Agency sold land at a written-down value to a private developer for construction of 83 town houses. The project represented an effort by the city to follow some elements of the recentering plan as well as to partially subsidize needed higher-density housing.    HAYWARD CITY HALL   BART's newly established property development office, led by Jeff Ordway, enabled the City of Hayward and BART to work together to achieve transit-oriented development. Hayward and BART worked to reconfigure BART-owned and city-owned parcels to build a new City Hall in the heart of the project area. The project received $1,000,000 from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (a Bay Area regional body) to build a pedestrian walkway from City Hall to the BART station, consciously keeping a clear line of sight between the two.   Next, the two agencies jointly issued a Request for Proposals for private development, on a design-build basis, for the new City Hall and multifamily housing, on land occupied by parking and abandoned buildings. By then, BART had built a garage on the other side of the station and no longer required the surface parking lot.   After an attenuated selection process, the developer chosen by the city decided to build only the City Hall. The city then selected a developer for the residential portion who would only build for-sale units. BART balked at this, because basic policy is to lease its land long term, not sell it, so as to retain the opportunity to participate in increased property values over time. Although this policy is fiscally sound, it posed an obstacle to the for-sale housing opportunity.   Fortunately, Alameda County owned property nearby. The city bought this parcel and swapped it with BART for the land that had been the subject of the RFP. Patty Hirota-Cohen, senior real estate officer for BART, recalls, ""This was a first for us. BART had never done such a land swap before. The swap enabled the city and the private sector to come together to build a new City Hall, offices, and housing. It turned out to be a win/win situation.""   The city then sold the land for the development of City Walk, 77 town homes built by The Olson Company, a firm specializing in urban infill projects. The city did not have to write down the land cost because the transit-oriented planning and development added enough value to make the subsidy unnecessary.   Lessons learned   •  Think creatively about land ownership, leasing, and development arrangements.  Public entities have varying approaches to land acquisition, ownership, and development that can pose obstacles to effective TOD. The ""land swap"" between the City of Hayward and BART is an inspired example of how agencies can work hand in hand to make development arrangements work for all parties. Fruitvale Transit Village is being constructed on the former BART surface parking lot, an elegant reclamation of valuable land for higher and better uses near transit.   •  Let the public into the process.  BART would never have known how to change the agency's approach to station development without approaching the public first. Much of the credit for this turnaround belongs to groups like the Unity Council and city officials such as Hayward's Jose Armas and Fruitvale's de la Fuentes, who were prepared to bring to the table a local vision for their communities that could replace the original plans.   •  Make preservation an explicit, key element in TOD.  In San Jose, VTA has aggressively pursued partnerships with political leaders, city planners, major public and private land-owners, and private developers to create a joint approach to guiding growth in the San Jose region that specifically recognizes the importance of existing historic buildings in downtown and nearby neighborhoods. The city's recently drafted redevelopment plan specifies architectural excellence and historic preservation as part of a successful planning strategy. In Fruitvale, the Unity Council's director Arabella Martinez says, ""in both the ongoing renovation of International Boulevard and the planned uses for our project, we pick up elements of our existing neighborhood. We are most concerned that we integrate the new with the old and respect the community fabric.""    Signs of success   The city agencies and nonprofit groups who have encouraged or undertaken transit-oriented development in San Jose, Fruitvale, and Hayward have provided the catalyst for private development of residential, retail, and office space in all these communities. The housing and civic improvements in Hayward have enabled the city to strike a profitable deal with the Albertson's grocery store chain to sell a parcel across from City Hall for a large, new supermarket and have led to the private redevelopment of 200 rental units across the BART tracks. According to Jesus Armas, ""The real success here is the merging of two elements of the public sector with the private sector. Although other cities talk about TOD, we've actually done it.""   The Fruitvale commercial district has experienced a dramatic transformation over the past 10 years, with storefront vacancies dropping from 40 percent to 1 percent during that time. Working with the National Main Street Center, the Unity Council has effected facelifts for more than 100 commercial properties in the area. In 2003, more than 50 business owners along International Boulevard voted to form a Business Improvement District to use 100 percent of the city fees collected from them for self-determined improvements to streets and services. The Transit Village is expected to attract an additional 11,000 transit riders to the Fruitvale station, already the ninth busiest in BART's 43-station system, and will reduce traffic and pollution in the station area. The Transit Village is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs for the area.   San Jose's TOD redevelopments have successfully bucked the national trend toward significant vacancies in the upper floors of street-level retail properties. Typically, even in strong downtowns across the country, upper floors above retail have high vacancy rates. The San Jose projects have consistently tenanted the upper floors, particularly with high-density residential uses. Retail remains the weakest use, largely because of the existence of eight large regional shopping malls within an eight-mile radius. Restaurants, however, are doing well in the downtown, as cultural and entertainment events in various venues are drawing people to the area.   Developers who are targeting San Jose's redeveloped historic Diridon Station cite the station as a major draw. The Castle Company, which has made a niche for itself in developing medium-to-high density residential projects near transportation hubs, believes such projects are less vulnerable to economic downturns because they respond to a pent-up demand for housing near transit stations and downtown jobs.   One block west of the historic San Jose cannery project is the 250 unit Cahill, a rental housing project completed in August 2002 and fully rented within five months in a soft market. David Lynn is development director for the project's sponsor, Avalon Bay, a Real Estate Investment Trust that has built some 44,000 rental units nationally. According to Lynn, ""We look at potential development sites for a variety of reasons. We are particularly seeking what we term 'supply-constrained' features. Transit stations are such features, particularly in the Bay Area, which is one of the most severely congested regions in the nation ...  and getting worse. A transit station nearby differentiates our sites. The Cahill site is one of our favorites, because the neighborhood is especially interesting for our residents, who have active lifestyles. They are highly educated and work in high value-added jobs. There are good restaurants in the area. The arena, an excellent entertainment venue, is nearby, and the Alameda is an eclectic street. And adjacency to the Diridon Station is a key element.""

Just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., the county is home to 190,000 people and more than 200,000 jobs. Arlington's neighborhoods have exemplified transit-oriented development since the turn of the 20th century. Transit investment spurred the initial development along Wilson Boulevard in the late 1890s, and transit investment was the crown jewel of the corridor's revitalization in the late 20th century.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   In the late 1890s, private developers created three 'commuter villages' -- Clarendon, Virginia Square, and Ballston -- along the new trolley lines serving Arlington County. Housing styles in these neighborhoods included four-squares, bungalows and Federal-revival residences. Young families attracted to these areas infused their neighborhoods with a spirit of civic enterprise that persists today in resident associations, park committees, and neighborhood activities.   In the 1930s and 1940s, thousands of new homes and garden-style apartments were built in Arlington to accommodate the federal government's expansion during the New Deal and World War II. One of the most prominent of the garden-apartment communities is Colonial Village, completed in 1940 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   By the early 1950s, the Clarendon-Virginia Square-Ballston area was a regional center for shopping, offices, and residences. The construction of the Capital Beltway in the 1960s pushed development away from Washington, and eroded Arlington's retail and office base.   Arlington revisited its land use planning and transit investment simultaneously in the 1970s, when the development of a master plan for Arlington County coincided with planning for the region's new Metrorail system. Close coordination of land use and transit planning during this crucial era enabled the county to direct major rail investment into the Wilson Boulevard corridor and build on existing street patterns that are conducive to transit use. The opening of the Orange Line in 1979 launched an unprecedented era of growth in Arlington County, guided by a transit-oriented General Land-Use Plan.    LAND USE AND TRANSIT   In the 1970s, extensive study and citizen participation led Arlington to ask the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) to reroute the proposed Orange Line from the median of Route 66 to the Wilson Boulevard/Fairfax Drive corridor. This action shifted development from the automobile-intensive Route 66 corridor, where park-and-ride facilities would have been required to serve the new Metro stations, to the historically transit-oriented Wilson Boulevard. This decision protected the property values and traditional character of neighborhoods in both areas by reducing auto traffic on nearby residential streets.   After finalizing the decision about the new rail route, Arlington County initiated its land use plan and developed flexible planning guidelines that gave clear instructions and incentives to developers of transit-oriented projects. The development community has taken full advantage of these guidelines, with confidence that their designs would be approved or easily amended to address county concerns.   WMATA now operates two Metrorail lines, the Blue and Orange, that serve Arlington County and connect the county to downtown Washington, D.C. and outlying suburbs. The Blue Line provides service to Ronald Reagan National Airport as well as the mixed-use developments of Pentagon City and Crystal City. The Orange Line serves the developing Rosslyn-Ballston corridor and Arlington's many residential communities. Five stations on the Orange Line have been the focus of intensive development: Rosslyn; Courthouse (with large-scale multiple-use developments for housing, retail, entertainment, government functions, and office space); Clarendon (an eclectic, mostly residential area with a bustling commercial core); Virginia Square, (site of a satellite campus for the state-run George Mason University); and Ballston (a residential/office/retail area anchored by a major shopping mall).   Metrobus and local bus services support rail service. Arlington County has limited parking at Metrorail stations through land-use policies that make walking easy and promote pedestrian access to Metrorail stations.    Image: Historic garden-style apartments provide affordable housing throughout Arlington County.   ""Arlington has a long history of civic involvement in setting public policy. Much of our prosperity and growth is directly attributable to the grassroots participation of citizens who have cared about Arlington's future.""   CHRISTOPHER ZIMMERMAN  2002 CHAIRMAN OF THE ARLINGTON COUNTY BOARD     COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT   Arlington County's numerous citizen commissions have helped to engage, educate, and support a strong cadre of well-informed residents who understand the intricacies of land use and transit policies, and who have bought into a long-term course of action for their community. The county has come to be known regionally for ""the Arlington Way"" of successfully involving thousands of citizens directly in government decision making.   The Arlington County Planning Commission, established in 1956, is the chief citizen advisory group that advises the five-member Arlington County Board on land use matters. Members of the County Board are elected to terms long enough to permit them to learn about the issues at stake and take controversial stances. The county government has a high-caliber staff and low staff turnover to support the Board's decisions. Elected officials work hard to capture citizens' expertise in the planning process through appointments to numerous commissions, committees, and boards addressing neighborhood preservation and economic development.   In 1998 the Arlington County Planning Division created the Office of Neighborhood Services to emphasize the county's commitment to neighborhood services and to consolidate existing neighborhood preservation and improvement programs within one unit. The Office of Neighborhood Services consists of three service areas: neighborhood planning and service delivery, historic preservation, and capital improvement planning and development. The goals of the office include the following:   • Better communication between residents and county government;  • Increased county responsiveness to neighborhood needs and trends;  • More effective coordination among county departments on neighborhood services;  • Active citizen participation and civic awareness; and  • Effective neighborhood service delivery tailored to the needs of individual neighborhoods.    PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS   Arlington has formed public-private partnerships in Metrorail station areas to bring residents, developers, and business interests together to discuss and resolve issues and to sponsor activities such as jazz festivals and an array of community events. Key partners include the Ballston-Virginia Square Partnership, the Clarendon Alliance, the Rosslyn Renaissance, and the Columbia Pike Revitalization Organization.   WMATA has played a significant role in the redevelopment of the rail corridor through the transit agency's Joint Development Program, particularly around the Ballston station, where WMATA controls just under 2 acres of land, enough for a sizeable redevelopment project. The Ballston station project is comprised of 200,000 square feet of office space, 277 residential units, 26,000 square feet of retail, plus a hotel, all at an estimated value of $135 million. WMATA owns a 99-year lease on the project and receives $450,000 in annual lease revenue, plus 8 percent of tenants' and developers' adjusted gross income. WMATA also realized profit from the sale of about 15,000 square feet of the parcel for residential development.   The county's Neighborhood Conservation Program (NCP), established in 1964, has financed neighborhood groups in self planned improvements to schools, playgrounds, street lighting, traffic controls, and sidewalks in 40 of Arlington's traditional neighborhoods. In 1999, when the program celebrated its 35th anniversary, Arlington residents voted $3.8 million in Community Conservation Bond funds for the NCP.   Neighborhood conservation and the partnerships exemplify the importance Arlington places on the ""public-private collaboration [that] helps create a modern 'urban village' concept that seeks to preserve historical essence while providing up-to-date amenities,"" according to recent information from Arlington County.   Image: Arlington's modern ""urban village"" concept preserves the sense of the historic community while permitting up-to-date development    Signs of success   Arlington County residents enjoy the lowest tax rate in the Washington metropolitan region, with considerable help from the development in the Metrorail corridors. Using only 6 percent of the land in the county, the rail corridors produce almost half of the total tax revenues for the county. The local tax base has increased from $5.3 billion to $27.2 billion since 1980, the year after the Orange Line opened, and the value of homes has also increased.   Office space along Wilson Boulevard has more than doubled since 1980, and 53 percent of all the county's office space is located in the corridor. The two Metrorail corridors along the Blue and Orange Lines account for 67 percent of all jobs in Arlington County. The addition of over 15,000 residential units in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor alone since 1980 represents 19 percent of the county's population and 23 percent of the total housing units. Almost 1 million square feet of retail space has followed the residential and office development, transforming Ballston from a declining area in neglect to a vibrant locale. The five stations in Arlington County account for 6 percent of Metrorail's weekday ridership throughout the entire Washington, D.C. region. Use of these stations has increased 41 percent since 1980.   Interest in preserving Arlington's historic resources was rare in the 1970s. Today, the effort is widespread, involving the county's Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board, the Arlington Historical Society, the Arlington Heritage Alliance, and the Neighborhood Conservation Program. As of 2001, the County Board had designated 28 local historic districts.    Lessons learned   •  Engage citizens and business people in long-term planning and development.  Today's informed resident or business owner could be tomorrow's planning commissioner, council member, or even mayor. Support ad hoc mechanisms (focus groups, charettes, and so on) with standing citizen committees, permanent community liaisons at planning commissions, or routine training for citizens and elected officials.    •  Make planning guidelines flexible and realistic, and include incentives for high-density development.  Arlington has demonstrated that the integration of land use and transportation planning need not be overly prescriptive or constraining. The development community has taken advantage of flexible planning guidelines and incentives for greater densities because they are confident that their projects are viable both economically and according to planning guidelines. The result is significant regional growth in a compact, older area of the region.    •  Define and protect your community's particular strengths.

Taking its name from a Native American word for ""strong,"" the city was already a center for river and railroad transportation before the Great Chicago Fire threatened to undo all its progress in a single night. In a characteristic burst of energy and vision, Chicagoans used the fire's devastation as a jumping-off point for revising and rebuilding the city, ushering in its Golden Age, as symbolized by the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition and the establishment of a rich and diverse architectural heritage, embodied in the city's 1909 master plan by architect Daniel Burnham.   Today the city is once again enjoying a remarkable comeback. Under the leadership of Mayor Richard M. Daley, Chicago has stemmed the population losses caused by earlier middle-class flight and urban disinvestment. Through the rehabilitation of older neighborhood assets and significant new construction, the city is attracting residents and revenues. Chicago's population, now approaching 3 million people, grew 4 percent during the 1990s.   Chicago's recent rehabilitation of the Green Line rail route and stations has dovetailed with the revitalization of several communities along the Green Line, including the predominantly African American community of West Garfield Park. The upgrade of the city's oldest elevated line and strategic relocation of the rail station have significantly complemented the longtime efforts of a private nonprofit group, Bethel New Life, to revitalize the area. More recently, the city has completely restored the historic Garfield Park Conservatory, within walking distance of the station. The renewed conservatory has attracted thousands of weekend transit users from all over the city and has made this community a focal point for cultural events and tourism. Through its work on the Green Line Conservatory Station and the Garfield Park Conservatory, Chicago has balanced and enhanced the interplay of history, civic character, ethnic diversity, and public transportation that make this great city so unique.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   West Garfield Park is located on Chicago's West Side, an area that historically was home to immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and Eastern Europe, and became predominantly African American during the past century. The area is served by the Lake Branch of the Green Line, built in 1892. At the center of West Garfield Park is one of the city's great open spaces, the 185-acre park that gives the neighborhood its name. The park's crown jewel is a 1908 conservatory that has been described as a work of ""landscape art under glass."" The Park Conservatory is within a half-mile of the Chicago Transit Agency (CTA) Conservatory Station. Until recently this area was overrun with drug traffic and crime, and attracted few outside visitors.   In the mid-1990s, CTA initiated a program to reconstruct and rehabilitate its oldest lines, starting with the Green Line in 1994. The $300 million project was funded with a combination of FTA rail modernization grants, matched by state and local funds. The restoration of the Green Line and the rebuilding of the Garfield Park Station helped to spur the rehabilitation of the conservatory. Both efforts have complemented existing initiatives to establish high-quality affordable housing and create jobs and cultural amenities in the area. Much of the revitalization activity is the work of Bethel New Life, a faith-based nonprofit group that has brought an estimated $110 million of new investment into this credit-starved community, creating more than 1,000 new units of affordable housing and securing 5,000 job placements in West Garfield Park since 1979.    GREENING THE GREEN LINE   Chicago's public transportation network is one of the world's most sophisticated, with railroads, transit, and bus routes reaching out in all directions to connect the city with its region. In addition, Chicago is the nerve center for passenger and freight rail in the United States.   CTA is the largest transit provider in the Chicago region. CTA's 11 rapid transit lines provide access throughout the city and in the surrounding suburban communities. Annual ridership on the rail lines exceeds 151 million trips. Ridership has increased steadily since 1998, helped by recent growth in population and employment.   Image: The rebirth of the Garfield Park Conservatory complemented the redevelopment of the Garfield Park Station on Chicago's Green Line elevated rail route.   Within this complex network, the three-branched, 25-station Green Line serves the West Side. Riding the Green Line from end to end demonstrates the diversity and contradictions of the city it serves: Its span connects industrial wastelands with genteel residential areas, breathtaking historic sites with brand-new construction, and open green spaces with busy urban streets. West Garfield Park and the conservatory at its heart combine many of these contradictions, and with them come both challenges and opportunities.   Image: The restored Garfield Park Conservatory, served by nearby transit, now attracts 15 times more visitors each year than in 1995.    Undertaken by the Chicago Park District, the restoration of the conservatory began in 1994, the same year that CTA began to reconstruct the West Garfield Park elevated train station. Although the station rehabilitation helped the Chicago Park District raise public and private resources, in typical Chicago fashion it also took a disaster to drive home the importance of preserving the conservatory. In the winter of 1994, a burst pipe froze and killed most of the rare and tropical plants housed inside the conservatory. ""That was the wake-up call,"" says Lisa Roberts, director of conservatories for the Chicago Park District. Faced with demolition or an $8 million restoration effort, the city bravely chose restoration. This former ""ghost town"" (with only 3,000 visitors in all of 1995), is once again a green oasis, attracting 15 times that many visitors in more recent years, and drawing a record-breaking 500,000 visitors to a recent show of glass works by artist Dale Chihuly.   Just as the Green Line rehabilitation enhanced the restoration of the West Garfield Park Conservatory, so has the conservatory's rebirth enhanced 20 years of housing and business redevelopment efforts in the area. The faith-based community development organization Bethel New Life, established in 1979, has implemented a holistic community revitalization plan that addresses housing, daycare and educational needs, traffic, neighborhood safety, recreation, and open spaces. Bethel New Life, which itself has been the engine of so much change in this challenging community, calls the redevelopment of the conservatory ""one of the major breakthroughs for this neighborhood."" Bethel New Life is building on the twin assets of a renewed historic park preserve and new train station to develop and implement plans for additional community reinvestment in West Garfield Park, including new homes in Parkside and three other areas, and a new commercial investment at the adjacent Green Line station at Lake and Pulaski with child care, community stores, and local jobs.

CTA relocated and retained the original historic station houses along the Green Line, supplementing them with new compatible construction that is ADA-compliant and modernized. During 2001, customers took one million more rides on the Green Line than in 1993, its last full year of service before it was closed for the rehabilitation. In fact, growth in ridership from 1990 to 2000 exceeded the growth in the region's population. Ridership on the Lake Branch alone, along which the Conservatory Station is located, has grown by more than 52 percent since 1993. Annual ridership was nearly 9.5 million in 2001.   The conservatory has become a center of community and commercial activity. The Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance, in partnership with public and private organizations, constructed an Urban Demonstration Garden at the conservatory in 2001 to teach gardening techniques specific to the challenges of urban spaces and to work with Westside community groups and residents to create, sustain, and improve neighborhood green spaces.   In May 2003 the Chicago Park District opened the Garfield Market, a green market that converts a historic building and rustic grounds at the conservatory into a European-style open-air bazaar offering unique green products from local merchants each weekend. The market also houses CityEscape Garden Center, a 10,000-square-foot privately operated landscaping store begun by a first-time local business owner, as well as 12 ""green-friendly"" shops. The Garfield Market adaptively reuses an old horse stable once used by the Chicago Park District.   ""A park should draw and attract visitors from around the city and those who live nearby,"" said Chicago Park District General Superintendent David Doig. ""At Garfield, exhibits such as  Chihuly: A Garden of Glass  and  Chocolate Festival  have made tremendous progress calling residents back to the historic hothouse, and now with the addition of The Green Market, selling products and foods, we hope visitors will extend their stay and neighbors will return to the Conservatory.""   The rehabilitation of the Green and Brown Lines, two of Chicago's elevated rail lines, has spurred reinvestment in the areas adjacent to the lines. Bethel New Life has built almost 40 new homes in the area since 1994, replacing derelict apartment buildings that had become drug dens.    Lessons learned   •  Look into the activities of nonprofit and faith-based groups in challenged neighborhoods.  Nonprofit housing developers are avatars of redevelopment in traditional and older neighborhoods. They are also natural partners in creating transit-supportive communities.   •  Never underestimate the power of a single historic landmark to be a flash point of community pride.  The restoration of the Garfield Park Conservatory created the opportunity for residents and visitors alike to see the surrounding neighborhood in a new light and consider it a Chicago destination in its own right.   •  Stay aware of major transit investments in the vicinity of historic resources.  In the case of the Garfield Park Conservatory, the rehabilitation and relocation of the Conservatory Station helped the Chicago Park District raise critical resources, both public and private, to save the site.       Back to top   Cleveland, Ohio   Reawakening a Historic Commercial District   SHAKER SQUARE SHOPPING CENTER   Cleveland Union Terminal has epitomized the concept of transit-oriented development in that city since the terminal's dedication in 1930. Now known as Tower City, the refurbished intermodal station in downtown Cleveland features a huge office and retail complex, the result of a public/private partnership led by the city's leading entrepreneurial family, the Ratners.   The original builders of Tower City were not interested in transit oriented development, as we know it today. Instead, M.J. and O.P. Van Sweringen -- two brothers affectionately known as ""the Vans"" -- were interested in development-oriented transit. Owners of several railroads and transit companies, the Vans initiated rail routes from downtown to the garden-city suburb they were developing in Shaker Heights, east of Cleveland.   Like Tower City, the retail center in Shaker Heights has been recently restored and upgraded. Conceived when trolleys and automobiles had just begun to share the streets, Shaker Square was designed to serve and enhance the surrounding neighborhood. The story of the creative public-private venture that brought new life to Shaker Square offers practical lessons for how communities can encourage local businesses, increase transit use, and reinvigorate residential areas while attracting visitors by transit.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   In 1905, the Van Sweringen brothers purchased property in a former Shaker community on the heights east of Cleveland. Inspired by the rural setting, and with a keen interest in city planning and design, the brothers envisioned one of the country's first ""garden-city"" suburbs with a mixture of handsome houses, apartments, shops, schools, and places of worship along tree-lined streets, interspersed with parks and lakes.   The brothers formed the Cleveland Interurban Railroad to bring streetcar lines and prospective homeowners from downtown Cleveland to the suburban homes they were building on lots east of the current location of Shaker Square. Dissatisfied with the streetcars' slowness and delays because of competing horse and automobile traffic, the Vans built a grade-separated trolley line to enhance service between Shaker Square and downtown. The ""rapid,"" as it was known, ran through Shaker Heights along the landscaped median of Shaker Boulevard, flanked by cartpaths for local travel. The line was eventually connected to the newly dedicated Cleveland Union Terminal in 1930.   Shaker Square, a retail center, opened in 1929. Located at the intersection of Shaker and Moreland Boulevards, the Square featured a trolley station and public green at the heart of a walkable network of shops, offices, and apartment buildings along landscaped boulevards, with streetscapes designed for walking. A limited number of curbside parking spaces fronted the stores, and larger lots were located behind the stores to accommodate foot traffic in the retail area.    In 1976, a half-century after its design was approved, Shaker Square and its surrounding apartment complexes were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By that time, the once-vibrant shopping center was on the wane, and its many local owner-operated shops were struggling to keep up with newer, larger shopping centers in distant suburbs. Vacancies in Shaker Square were increasing and the center's physical plant was threatened with decline.    For Adam Fishman and Randy Ruttenberg, partners in a local development company, CenterPoint Properties, and residents of Shaker Heights, going to the Square had been a way of life. Sensitive to its history and role in the community, they began to formulate ideas for how to bring the Square back.   Image: The Shaker Square RTA Light Rail Station shuttles residents and visitors to this newly revitalized commercial district to enjoy unique shops, boutiques, restaurants, and entertainment venues.    SHAKING UP SHAKER SQUARE   Working with its development partner the Rosen Corporation, the development team of CenterPoint Properties sought a mix of tenancies that would not only meet the everyday needs of neighborhood residents, but would serve more discretionary demand and draw people from beyond the primary market area with unique shops, boutiques, restaurants, and entertainment venues.   An important consideration in selecting tenants was to match the pocketbooks of the community. The average household income within the Square's primary trade area is more than $94,000, and incomes in the Shaker Heights neighborhood to the east are even higher. The western portion of the Shaker Square neighborhood, which includes many of the apartment complexes, is also among Cleveland's highest-income communities, but averages a more moderate $32,000 per household. That population includes a high proportion of young professionals, with significant discretionary spending habits despite lower overall income. The developers planned to create a tenant mix that would appeal to the range of middle- and upper-income households within the shopping area. CenterPoint also wanted to carefully balance national, regional, and local stores: ""We didn't want just another center filled with the same national chains,"" says Fishman. Several of the existing tenants were seen as local institutions, and enjoyed strong local support. Fishman and Ruttenberg wanted to retain these and attract other local stores and restaurants. The developers set aside space for only a handful of recognized national retailers.   Fishman's vision for a tenant mix that included non-chain tenants was informed by the 1997 experience of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) in leasing space in Shaker Square's historic transit station. Maribeth Feke, GCRTA's director of planning, recalls the agency's enthusiasm over a proposal by McDonald's to replace the station's outgoing tenant, undertake $250,000 in renovations, and pay a high annual rent. Now, Feke admits the agency blundered: ""There was major opposition from the local community, and it made all the papers. There was even a group formed called MAM: Moms Against McDonald's."" Chastened, Feke reached out to the community. Although residents made it clear that a national fast-food chain was out of the question, they also suggested a hometown alternative: a diner.   A second RFP was issued, and Michael's Diner became the station tenant. The proprietor invested $150,000 toward rehabilitation and finishes. GCRTA contributed $35,000 from their station renovation fund for mechanical system and roofing upgrades. The diner opened in 1997.   Since then, GCRTA has completely revamped its approach to station area projects and leases. ""We now have a neighborhood representative at the table from the beginning,"" notes Feke, ""and we go to the community throughout the process. We learned a valuable lesson.""   Image: Trendy shops, such as the ones pictured, cater to the growing number of residents in the Shaker Square neighborhood.   ""We wanted a mixture of tenants that created synergy, making the Square an exciting and fun place.""  ADAM FISHMAN CENTERPOINT PROPERTIES    THE REMAKING OF SHAKER SQUARE   After about 18 months of negotiations and planning, CenterPoint launched an extensive community outreach effort. Reid Robbins, executive director of the Shaker Square Area Redevelopment Corporation (SHAD), a community development corporation that serves much of the surrounding community and focuses on the Square, reports that the developers ""attended a ton of meetings, worked really hard, and did really well."" Despite minor controversies over repositioning some tenants, Robbins recalls that CenterPoint's sensitivity to community and design issues, combined with strong support for saving the Square, assured that the proposals would be well received.   The project began in 2000, and was largely completed and leased within 12 months. Approximately 132,000 square feet of retail and 29,000 square feet of office area accommodates 56 different tenants. Initial anchor tenants included the upscale Wild Oats Market grocery store; Joseph Beth Booksellers, a regional bookstore and cafe; and Shaker Square Cinema, a refurbished historic movie house under a new, local owner. Other tenants include a variety of restaurants, from moderately priced to upscale; clothing stores; specialty stores offering housewares and kitchen accessories; stationary and gift shops; bakers and confectioners; art and photo galleries; hairdressers and spas; and a bank.   To accommodate the grocery store, three existing vendors were moved, their former store spaces combined, and the building footprint expanded. Parking was added to an enlarged rear lot. Aside from those alterations, the original Shaker Square structures were retained and restored. Extensive upgrades included awnings and a signage regime, all approved through the local historic review procedures. The streetscapes and public areas throughout the complex were also improved. To enhance pedestrian activity, outdoor cafe spaces were added at some restaurant locations, and the developers have also programmed outdoor events and occasional street performers on the public greens.    FINANCING   Total project costs were projected at $25.6 million. Fishman and Ruttenberg raised approximately $17.3 million from conventional debt and equity sources, leaving an $8.3 million gap. To make up the shortfall, CenterPoint cobbled together a wideranging public-private partnership involving state, county, and local officials and community development organizations.   A particularly interesting aspect of the gap financing was the role of tax increment financing (TIF). Although Shaker Square is located entirely within Cleveland's city limits, 80 percent of the area's property falls within the Shaker Heights School District. The developers had to secure approval for a TIF bond from both Shaker Heights and Cleveland. After a number of presentations, the developers were able to convince both jurisdictions that the investment in revitalizing Shaker Square would be in their interest. Without it, the property was likely to continue to lose value and tax revenues decline. With the TIF, values and tax revenues were certain to rise.   Shaker Heights agreed to forgo taxes on 75 percent of increased value for a period of 25 years. The jurisdiction would collect increased revenues against the remaining 25 percent. Cleveland agreed to forgo 100 percent of increases in non-school tax revenues for a period of 30 years.   Bond purchasers also had to be assured not only that the tax base would be adequately expanded to produce revenues to pay off the bonds, but that the project would have the resources to make the service payments in lieu of taxes to the bond fund as well. This combination proved difficult. In an unprecedented move for a private project, the Cuyahoga County Commissioners stepped in with a pledge to support the bonds. With the enhanced credit provided by that pledge, Cleveland Tomorrow, a community boosting subsidiary of the Cleveland Development Bank, and Neighborhood Progress, Inc., a community investment subsidiary of Village Capitol Corporation, purchased the bonds.

Building exteriors have been restored and interiors rehabilitated, streetscapes upgraded and enlivened with cafes and awnings, and the public green space improved. The area is alive with activity throughout the day and into the evening. The $4.1 million tax base prior to renovation grew into $18.5 million in just two years.   When the project started, 31 percent of the space at the center was vacant. Within a year, the project was able to attract new and replacement tenants, reaching virtual full occupancy. CenterPoint met its initial base rent projections and is realizing additional percentage rents from a number of tenants, a clear sign of good sales. Before renovation and repositioning, average rents at the Square were between $7 and $9 per square foot. Rents now average between $17 and $24, triple net. Net operating income produced from the center has quadrupled.   One anchor tenant, Wild Oats Market, closed in 2003, accounting for approximately 20 percent of the retail area in the complex. The Boulder-based company cited corporate problems and restructuring that resulted in the closing of a number of locations across the nation. CenterPoint was in active discussion with replacement grocers as this report went to press.   Transit use has been depressed throughout Cleveland since the national economic downturn. Boardings at the Shaker Square station are no exception. GCRTA's Feke believes that the numbers for Shaker Square might have been worse without the renovation. The transit agency's anecdotal evidence suggests that the project has generated new trips to see the reborn facility: ""I have talked with many people who have a renewed interest in taking the train to Shaker Square,"" says Feke. ""It is being seen as a destination by folks who had not gone there before and by those who had been there but not for a long time because the area had lost its luster.""   Robbins agrees: ""We are getting people from downtown and westside urban types riding out for a nice evening at the restaurants and shops. Before, there was none of that.""   Image: The land use and urban design concept of Shaker Square has proven to have enduring merit.    Lessons learned   •  Notice and respect what has withstood the test of time.  The land use and urban design concept of Shaker Square has proven to have enduring merit. The transit station is integrated into a shopping and service complex at the center of a moderate- to high-density residential community, which continues to provide the foundation for both shop patrons and transit ridership. Shaker Square locates parking to the rear of stores to preserve the historic character and accommodate pedestrians. Walkable, appealing streetscapes lead to the station and a public green, reinforcing the Square as the center of community activity.   •  Encourage public-private partnerships.  The combined clout of private development know-how with public resources and informational mechanisms for raising public awareness can greatly assist in a retail redevelopment of any scale.   •  Reach out to the public early and often.  CenterPoint made a substantial investment in community outreach. Their programs were not only informed by those contacts, but the investment laid the foundation for community support for renovation plans, public participation in financing, and ultimately patronage of transit and stores as well.      Back to top   Evanston, Illinois   Bustling 'Burb Boasts Intermodal Connection   DAVIS STREET TRANSPORTATION CENTER DEVELOPMENT   Evanston, a suburban city 13 miles north of Chicago's Loop along Lake Michigan, has been linked to Chicago throughout its history by rail lines, trolleys, and buses. Incorporated in the late 1800s, Evanston is now home to 74,000 people.   Evanston's recently completed Davis Street Transportation Center has given the community a single facility to serve as a hub for commuter rail (Metra), regional subway (the Chicago Transit Authority), and suburban bus services (PACE). The Transportation Center is the only transfer point outside the City of Chicago that brings all three transit providers together. As a result, the Davis Street Center is the twelfth most active transfer point in the Chicago region.   More than just a connection for rail and bus service, however, the Davis Street Transportation Center is a strong contributor to the broader redevelopment of downtown Evanston. Coupled with focused investment within the station area, Evanston has strengthened its overall market appeal for employers, while providing creative housing and retail opportunities to draw residents downtown, and offering incentives to developers to preserve and reuse historic commercial buildings.   Evanston's current comprehensive plan emphasizes creating ""an attractive, convenient, and economically vibrant"" mixed-use downtown, and offering ""safe, affordable, and easily accessible alternatives to the automobile."" The earlier development patterns support these goals well. Developers are finding new uses for older assets, supported by transit service and anchored by the Davis Street Transportation Center.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Downtown Evanston developed as a traditional suburban center with a mix of retail and small office space, pedestrian facilities, strong public transit service, and a variety of architectural styles. As shopping centers were built along new highways, retail activity in Evanston's downtown declined. But the pedestrian orientation, mix of architectural styles, and access to public transportation remained.   Redevelopment efforts during the late 1980s focused on creating office space for high-tech organizations, which in turn led to the construction of the Evanston Research Park in downtown, on land located between the Chicago Transit Agency (CTA) and Metra rail lines.   Beyond the Research Park initiative, the city's redevelopment plan for downtown Evanston emphasized mixed uses, including residential, and creating a ""24/7"" environment. Early projects included a hotel, a movie complex, additional parking, a grocery, 280 rental apartments, and a new office tower near the Davis Street Transportation Center. The growth of traffic congestion throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, changing demographics, and the desire for urban amenities without all the urban headaches helped to make the 1990s the strongest real estate market since the 1920s for Evanston. The new area of development is focused within walking distance of the Transportation Center.    REDEVELOPING YESTERDAY'S EVANSTON FOR TODAY   A number of older buildings are within walking distance of the Davis Street Transportation Center. Many of these buildings have been adapted to new uses. The variety of architectural styles and periods contributes to Evanston's uniqueness, and the physical context provides an interesting place where people want to be.   To support its redevelopment efforts, Evanston uses tax increment financing (TIF) districts to fund extraordinary costs for site preparation such as the cost of demolition, environmental remediation, parking structures, and streetscape improvements. The City of Evanston does not usually use tax abatements. The county provides for reduced assessments for landmark buildings and reimbursement of state sales tax.   Developers have recognized the market appeal of a downtown location with easy access to good transit services, as well as the advantages of redeveloping older buildings. The Davis Street Land Company, for example, has transformed the Chandler's Building (a 25,000 square-foot former variety store built in 1929) into a mixed-use development with ground-level retail and office space above . The project, located one block from the Davis Transportation Center, involved tearing down a smaller nineteenth century structure that was determined to be unusable and redeveloping the five-story L-shaped 1929 building. The county designated the building a historic landmark and granted it a 10-year tax abatement, a critical element in the project's success. No parking was provided for the project. The developer, who spent $4.3 million on the project, also made use of the federal historic rehabilitation tax credits.   Image: Left and Below: The Davis Street Transportation Center in Evanston, Illinois is a hub for intermodal transportation serving the community.   The City of Evanston participated in financing the costs of the public plaza in front of the building through a TIF district.   A former Marshall Field department store built circa 1910 has been converted into 55 condominiums with 43,000 square feet of commercial/retail space, including a community church. The building at 807 Church Street is located in the heart of downtown, just a short walk from the Davis Street Transportation Center. The developer, Creative Designs and Builders, transformed the building into rental housing in the early 1980s, converting to market-rate condominiums in 2001. The cost of transforming the department store to housing was $4.2 million, all financed privately.   In recognition of the importance of pedestrian facilities to downtown redevelopment and transit access, Evanston created a special service district in the downtown to provide for pedestrian and streetscape improvements, and property owners agreed to tax themselves to provide funding for these improvements.   Parking spaces have been added in the downtown to support the new development. In one garage, the 1,400 spaces are shared (commuters use the spaces during the daytime, and retail and movie goers use the spaces during the evenings and on weekends). The city encourages shared parking to reduce the overall number of spaces required to serve the different, non-competing uses.    Image: The historic Chandler's building shown here during a veteran's parade through downtown Evanston, now offers mixed retail and office space in 25,000 square feet, just steps from the new Davis Street Transportation Center.    Signs of success   Evanston is enjoying its strongest real estate market since the 1920s, as developers and citizens discover that close-in suburbs offer a mixture of architectural styles, around-the-clock activities, and the convenience of a good pedestrian environment and transit alternatives.   From 1998 to 2003 more than $300 million of private funds have been or will be invested in more than 600,000 square feet of commercial/retail space, more than 1,000 residential units, and almost 3,000 new parking spaces.   New and old buildings together have created a renewed ""sense of place,"" which is leading to more proposals for residential, retail, and commercial spaces. As older buildings are converted to new uses, they have added to Evanston's revenue base through sales and real estate taxes. On the Chandler Building, Evanston has more than doubled its tax revenue from sales and real estate taxes as a result of the rehabilitation, even with the landmark tax abatement.   Transit ridership accounts for more than 12,000 weekday trips to and from downtown Evanston. Metra, the commuter rail operator, has had the greatest growth in riders, almost 150 percent between 1983 and 1999. CTA rail accounts for the greatest number of trips, roughly 7,000 each weekday.   The development and redevelopment in downtown Evanston have increased off-peak weekend trips as well as weekday. As the downtown adds new office, residential, and retail uses, the market for transit grows. The relationship is synergistic: Good transit encourages more development, which in turn increases transit ridership.    Lessons learned   •  Use local transit planning efforts to give your community a sense of direction and commitment, opening the way to private-sector development and investment.  When Evanston sought to revitalize its downtown in the 1980s, it put forward a comprehensive vision and set of planning goals to encourage transit use, retail, and new workers in the suburban center. Improvements to the transit infrastructure through the Davis Street Center have reinforced the local planning efforts.  •  Encourage a mixture of old and new buildings that offers a physical context and visual interest, and that adapts to a range of activities.  Most older suburban areas have the infrastructure and range of building types to attract new uses and activities. These areas also have underdeveloped lots and sometimes brownfields that are available for new development. Evanston's planning guidelines provide for a variety of uses and building types, making the downtown equally attractive for historic preservation projects, adaptive reuse, and new construction.

Although the Maryland Transit Administration operates a MARC commuter rail line through Gaithersburg, and a historic 1884 commuter train station stands at the town center, commuter service was perceived as a means for residents to leave Gaithersburg for job locations elsewhere, not a mechanism for attracting riders to Gaithersburg.   Gaithersburg town officials were seeking ways to create a mixture of land uses downtown; attract new business patrons, workers, and residents; make better use of existing and often historic properties; and stimulate complementary infill projects that reinforced traditional small-town character. An overarching objective was to accommodate automobile parking for all those hoped-for new workers, visitors, and employees. By adopting a progressive parking strategy, Gaithersburg is not only achieving its primary objectives, but has set in motion a dynamic that is creating transit synergies as well.   Gaithersburg offers insights into how a town can revitalize its historic resources, address current parking needs while evolving to greater transit use and development that recognizes the transit connection as beneficial.     COMMUNITY HISTORY   Gaithersburg's pattern of growth and disinvestment in the 20th century mirrors that of many small towns throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. Its downtown, once the market and freight center for a flourishing agricultural community, has maintained its low scale, historic character, and charm, and rapid residential expansion from the 1950s onward occurred mostly in suburban subdivisions at the fringes. Retail and commercial centers (conventional strip centers, office parks, and malls) were also located on the perimeter of the downtown, siphoning off most business revenue.   The cherished character of the historic core was threatened. Several traditional downtown businesses, such as the large Southern States store, no longer met changing market demand. As these anchors slipped, the number of patrons for remaining stores also declined. Many shop owners and businesses were just hanging on by the 1990s, when revitalization efforts began.    TOWN AND PARKING   In early 1995, a diverse group of concerned citizens, property owners, and civic leaders recognized that Olde Town Gaithersburg was at a crossroads. Although individual projects, such as the restoration of the small historic commuter station, were important, a more comprehensive approach was needed. The city hired internationally known town planner Andres Duany to conduct an intensive community charette to flesh out ideas. About a year later, after continued discussion and refinement, consensus around a downtown plan emerged.   A key concept of the plan was accommodating parking to the side and rear of buildings whenever possible. This approach supported the restoration of historic properties, rather than their removal for parking lots, and encouraged developers to site complementary infill projects at the traditional building line to maintain the pedestrian feel of the street. In combination with a program for calming through-traffic and improving streetscapes, this strategy promised an environment that was convenient, walkable, and attractive.   Another important concept was investment in municipal parking garages. Land was scarce and demand for parking was rising. Decked parking not only reduced the pressure to raze existing properties for surface lots, but made possible redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties as well. Without a garage and the regulatory framework allowing existing and new projects to meet parking needs, potential infill lots would likely be retained for parking. Land economics in Gaithersburg simply did not support private investment in a garage, and so public investment was essential.

Image: Landscaping and public art enliven the area surrounding Gaithersburg's historic train station and nearby municipal parking.   WHERE TO START   The sector of Olde Towne targeted for initial redevelopment was situated immediately south of the railroad tracks and west of the town's main street, Summit Avenue. Principal uses included the Southern States store and scattered surface parking lots. The lots were used by shoppers and commuters boarding MARC trains (Maryland's commuter railroad) at the restored station opposite Summit Avenue. Just to the north is Olde Towne's historic district, which includes most of the area's shops and restaurants.   Redevelopment concepts emerging from Duany's work called for a new commercial project to be located along Summit Avenue on a parcel owned by the city and used by MARC commuters for parking. A large adjacent parcel, occupied by the Southern States store, would also be repositioned. On it would be a multi-story parking garage next to the railroad tracks, where it would provide a buffer from train noise. Parcels fronting the garage along Summit Avenue would be redeveloped for office and retail uses. A realigned street would border the southern portion of the sector, again with a redevelopment pad between the street and parking garage. Apartments were suggested for that parcel.   The parking garage, projected at approximately 700 spaces, was to serve several uses. About one-third of the spaces would be used by MARC commuters, with the rest devoted to meeting the needs of the new development projects on fronting lots, as well as the general public. On evenings and weekends, when commuting and worker demand is low, spaces would be available for shoppers and visitors attending cultural and civic events.    GETTING THE FIRST PROJECT ON THE GROUND   By 1997, City Manager Dave Humpton was receiving inquiries from developers. Town officials decided to look first at the infill possibilities for the MARC commuter parking lot along Summit Avenue. Municipal ownership of this key parcel provided the best opportunity for influencing the quality of development. The city also owned another lot in the vicinity where parking could be relocated with little inconvenience. The city issued a Request for Proposals.   Steve Virostek of the DANAC Corporation, a local development company, proposed an office project to bring daytime employment to Olde Town. Virostek knew this type of project would not be an easy sell to prospective tenants. To compete with the spacious suburban office parks nearby, DANAC would have to offer higher-quality design and finishes than the competition -- with lower rents. To afford that combination, and address the risks listed by financial partners, he would need the city to be a partner.   Not only did Gaithersburg's officials select DANAC's proposal, Mayor Ed Borher and City Manager Dave Humpton enthusiastically supported DANAC's development program and financial incentive package. The City Council agreed to contribute its property to the project. To ensure that the project set the bar high for quality building and streetscape design that complemented the downtown's historic character, the city also provided a $1 million loan to DANAC, to be repaid interest free through DANAC's dedication of half of the cash flow from the project. DANAC assumed all responsibility for both the office and public space improvements, and for getting underway immediately. DANAC also assumed the biggest financial risk: whether the project could attract office tenants to the 42,000- square-foot project.   By May 1998, when the ribbon was cut, the project was already 100 percent leased. Virostek credits the city's willingness to help finance more expensive tenant finishes, such as sound attenuation from the warning blasts of CSX freight trains as they crossed Summit Avenue.    MORE SUCCESS   Encouraged by the success of his initial project and the partnership enjoyed with the city, Virostek explored purchase of the adjacent parcel owned and occupied by Southern States. The company was ready to sell, but the site was contaminated by leakage from an old underground petroleum storage tank. After testing and negotiation about the clean-up costs, DANAC entered into a contract to purchase the parcel.   During the clean-up, Virostek began discussions with Humpton and other town officials on a detailed reuse program for the property. By 1999, DANAC and the city had reached agreement. While modifications were made to Duany's concept, the basic components remained.   A multi-story rental apartment, with first-floor retail space (68 units and 20,000 square feet retail/service) would be constructed on the south parcel, which DANAC had sold to the Magruder Companies, an area residential company. DANAC would build and own an office building of approximately 65,000 square feet, with 6,000 square feet held in reserve for retail development as the market matured. Although higher in density and scale than the predominant pattern, the project was carefully designed to complement the character of the town and its abutting historic district. Quality materials and finishes would again be used. The city would begin immediately to implement the planned infrastructure and streetscape upgrades in the sector, targeting completion to coincide with the opening of the private projects. The city forgave half of its permit fees.   The agreement also specified how the 720-space parking garage component would be built and managed:   • The city bought the parcel for the parking garage from DANAC for $750,000. Gaithersburg would own both the land and the garage and would be responsible for operation and management.  • Under a negotiated agreement, the city hired DANAC as its development manager to construct the garage. DANAC was responsible for overseeing all aspects of design and development, subject to city approval. A not-to-exceed fee was set at $6,925,000. DANAC assumed the risk of overruns and agreed not to take any fee for its management or personnel expenses.  • In consideration of services provided by DANAC, the city agreed to reserve 126 spaces for the new, multi-family housing project. Another 200 spaces were reserved for the office project. All remaining spaces were for the general public. Spaces were allotted to a planned restaurant, but not formally reserved.  • MARC commuters were expected to use spaces set aside for the general public, and DANAC agreed to construct a pedestrian bridge across the railroad tracks, connecting to the historic district and providing convenient access to the train station along reconstructed streets.  • The city has no current plans to charge for parking. In the future, payments by the housing and office projects would be imposed on negotiated schedules. The schedule for office workers provides an initial period of no parking charges and rises to 100 percent of the fee charged to the general public over a 20-year period. The residential fee schedule is more generous, and provides for a 30-year phase-in period.    Image: The pedestrian scale of Gaithersburg's historic Olde Towne has not been disturbed by new nearby development.     FINANCING   The combined public/private price tag for the project was estimated at $42.3 million. Costs of land and improvements for the office, residential, and restaurant projects would be approximately $13.4 million, to be shouldered by the developers. The remaining $28.9 million was to be raised from public funds to acquire the parcel, construct the garage, and rebuild public infrastructure. Costs included acquisition of land for street realignment and streetscape improvements (brick sidewalks, lighting, signage, benches, trash receptacles, intersection improvements, and underground utilities).   Fiscally conservative Gaithersburg had always maintained a ""pay-as-you-go"" philosophy. The city was prepared to take on the lion's share of public costs from its capital accounts, but it needed partners for the rest. Over several months it aggressively lobbied county and state officials for support. At the same time, Humpton worked closely with Virostek to ensure that the schedule for payment of the city's obligations for the garage would coincide with funding cycles. In the end, $24,900,000 was secured from three public sources over a three-year period from fiscal years 1999 through 2001: $13,100,000 in cash, reserves, and anticipated tax revenues from the City of Gaithersburg; $5,800,000 in cash or General Obligation bonds from Montgomery County; and $6,000,000 in cash and Smart Growth grants from the State of Maryland. Although $4 million short of the full funding estimate, these committed funds were adequate to satisfy all partners that enough work would be completed to allow the project to proceed. The city pledged to continue to work with the state to identify additional funding, possibly through state transportation programs, and if not feasible, through a combination of its own and private funds.    Signs of success   Like the first phase, the second phase has been a strong success. By 2001, the three main components of the project (the apartment, office complex, and garage) were completed and occupied. Infrastructure and streetscape improvements were in place. There have been numerous expressions of interest in the restaurant pad, which is still undeveloped.   Initially, Virostek lured a high-tech company as the prime tenant for the office. With the downturn of that sector of the economy, the tenancy evaporated. Replacement tenants were relatively easy to find, however. The office leased ahead of schedule, and met or exceeded rent projections. Virostek reports that some tenants cited the location on the MARC commuter line as a consideration in taking space.   Similarly, the apartments were snatched up more quickly and at higher rents than projected. The Magruder Companies actively marketed the project's location on the MARC commuter line. While definitive surveys on transit use have not been completed, project manager Scott Reed and leasing director Nancy Malloy observe that a number of tenants commute to work by transit, and the service was cited as a reason for renting units. ""The transit connection is a definite plus,"" says Malloy.   The garage is functioning well. Its brick facade and decorative tower and pedestrian bridge complement the character of the adjacent historic district. Most of the MARC line's nearly 300 daily commuters are using the fourth floor and pedestrian bridge, as designed. This frees the lower levels for shorter-term visitors to local businesses. Shop owners report having employees use the garage, making street spaces adjacent to their businesses available for patrons.   On most days the garage operates at well below capacity. Far from suggesting overbuild, Humpton sees this excess capacity as an investment. Plans are underway for additional development projects to the rear of the garage site. Allocating spaces to those projects, thus reducing costs to the eventual developer, is being considered as a tool to leverage the same type of quality and design exemplified by the DANAC and Magruder projects.   Most importantly, the development, parking, and streetscape projects have breathed new life into Olde Towne, while maintaining desired small town charm. More jobs and retail activity are located in Olde Towne now, although additional market support is still needed. The success of the initial projects has laid the foundation for continued residential and commercial infill projects and for adaptive reuse of underutilized historic properties.

Although the presence of MARC commuter service to the community was a factor in the city's redevelopment scheme, city officials were more focused on the current buzz about smart growth and new urbanism. Whatever the motivation, Gaithersburg's adoption of a progressive parking plan -- and subsequent urban design guidelines and zoning that support both historic preservation and new downtown development -- shows how parking design can encourage compact growth and help accomplish transit-oriented design.   Some advocates for transit-oriented development have promoted imposed limitations on parking around station stops to encourage transit use. Likewise, some preservationists have sought to reduce or limit parking in historic areas. Given the practical realities of auto dependence in Gaithersburg, however, its leadership recognized that parking needed to be maintained and expanded. By opting for a strategy that focused on parking design and management approaches, the city provides an example that may be applicable to other commuter towns. In a very real sense, Gaithersburg's parking strategy has facilitated both increased preservation and construction of transit-supportive projects. The garage also provides a venue for monitoring parking demand as revitalization continues --  with the flexibility to use that experience to adjust allocation of parking and encourage additional transit-supportive projects as the automobile-transit dynamic evolves.   •  Put muscle and money where your mouth is.  Beyond a good framework, the critical decision Gaithersburg made was to support its progressive parking approach with investment of public personnel, property assets, and funding to see the project through.  •  Private developers and public entities need each other.  The public and private sectors in Gaithersburg each brought their own resources to the table, and created a successful downtown strategy that took advantage of what each sector could offer. Virostek and DANAC brought market savvy, persistence, and creativity to the table. Mayor Bohrer and City Manager Humpton brought a specific vision for the downtown, city-owned property, funding, and connections to county and state officials with whom they aggressively pursued partnerships.  •  Don't create parking for parking's sake . The Gaithersburg parking garage was conceived as a tool to leverage achievement of the city's objectives for land use, urban design, historic preservation, and economic development. The garage is a critical element in the success of the new development projects. The garage is also designed to support instead of undermine the historic character of the town and the attractiveness of transit to its residents and employees.   Image: New development across from Gaithersburg's historic train station reflects similar design elements to those of the station.      Back to top   Memphis, Tennessee   South Main is Happening   ADAPTIVE REUSE AS A STRATEGIC URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENT   Back when ""cotton was king,"" the South Main section of Memphis was bustling. Today, the warehouses and factories of Memphis's South Main historic district are being filled with residents, artist studios, galleries, local restaurants, and locally owned shops. Strategic public investments catalyzed South Main's rebirth, and local private investors rescued the area and gave it new life.   The rebirth of South Main began with the restoration of a downtown trolley system in 1993 and renovation of Central Station as a mixed-use intermodal center at the southern end of downtown. The new National Civil Rights Museum is among the attractions that have motivated visitors to take the trolley into the South Main area.   Most of the pioneering developers and investors in South Main are Memphis-based individuals with a personal connection to local history. No mega-projects or large public subsidies have been necessary to entice developers. With the area's rebirth have come increasing trolley ridership, tourism, and housing opportunities downtown.    COMMUNITY HISTORY   Up to 50 trains a day once delivered passengers and cargo to South Main via Central Station. The post-war period, however, saw rapid decline of both rail travelers and the industries that sustained business activity. The downtown trolley system was dismantled after World War II. Many of the handsome historic buildings lining South Main Street fell into disrepair, vacancy, and virtual abandonment.   An effort to revitalize downtown with a pedestrian mall in the 1970s failed. By the late 1980s, the mall was actually seen as contributing to lack of mobility and parking problems in the South Main area.   In 1993, Memphis inaugurated the first leg of the Main Street Trolley system in the right-of-way of Main Street. This two-track line largely traced the route of the old streetcar line. By 1997, the single-track Riverfront Loop was added, doubling the system's length to five miles. Most of the new segment used existing railroad tracks located parallel to Main Street and running along the bluffs fronting the Mississippi River, before reconnecting to Main Street at the south and north ends.    DOWNTOWN TROLLEY AND CENTRAL STATION   More than just a downtown circulator, the Main Street Trolley connects to the city's bus system through transfer facilities and park-and-ride lots at its north terminus and through bus, park-and-ride, and Amtrak connections at the south terminus, the recently renovated Central Station.   Initially criticized as a gimmick to save downtown, the trolley has nonetheless succeeded. Ridership has grown from just short of 500,000 in the first year of operation to about one million in 2002. Tom Fox, director of planning and capital projects for the Memphis Area Transit Agency (MATA), estimates that approximately half of the riders use the trolley to commute, run errands, and make work-related trips. The other half are made by tourists, visitors, and residents in pursuit of entertainment. Jeff Sanford, president of Memphis Center City Commission, which plans for and promotes downtown's economic development, believes the trolley has helped draw more than $2 billion in project investments in downtown during recent years, especially in the South Main area.   Built in 1914, Central Station was the last building designed by Daniel Burnham. In the early 1990s, MATA officials planned to transform the then-derelict building into an intermodal terminal for the trolley, bus services, and the remaining twice-daily Amtrak trains. MATA also sought new uses for long-vacant office and retail spaces that were part of the complex. In 1995, MATA acquired the building and, after securing federal, state, and city funding, joined with city agencies, the Center City Commission, preservationists, and neighborhood groups to devise a plan for the station's rebirth.   Judith Johnson, who was then a preservation analyst for the City of Memphis and is now principal of the preservation consulting firm Judith Johnson and Associates, suggested the use of historic preservation tax credits. MATA asked the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Community Partners Program to join the planning team. That collaboration resulted in a palette of potential uses for the space and, importantly, a proposed ownership structure that could make use of tax credits. As a public agency, MATA could not use the credits. The stakeholders decided to form an independent, for-profit limited partnership that would include MATA. Through a Request for Proposals process, the Alexander Company of Madison, Wisconsin was selected as a private partner. Over a period of approximately 15 months, the partnership developed a program for restoring Central Station, structured a partnership agreement that met with all parties' approval, and secured funding to accomplish the program. The restoration was completed in 1999.   About 30,000 Memphis residents and officials gathered in December 1999 to celebrate Central Station's rebirth. In addition to the intermodal component, the project includes 63 apartment units occupying former office space, three storefront retail spaces, a precinct police station, and a conference area adjacent to the fully restored Main Hall. Total project costs were approximately $23.3 million. In addition to the $17.9 million from federal, state, and city sources, the project received $3.0 million in preservation tax credits, $2.4 million in bank financing, and $0.1 million from Amtrak.    SOUTH MAIN NEIGHBORHOOD   The most remarkable outcome of the trolley and Central Station efforts is how they catalyzed private-sector activity along South Main. Placed on the National Register in 1982, the South Main historic district includes approximately 90 buildings, all but a few determined as contributing to its historic character. More than 60 percent of South Main's historic buildings had been renovated by 2002. Historic properties are also being restored in areas adjacent to South Main. Infill construction on vacant lots is also taking place. Virtually all this reinvestment has occurred since start-up of the trolley, and the majority has occurred in the years after Central Station was restored.   Image: Memphis's Central Station was restored for intermodal service and mixed residential-commercial use with the aid of federal historic preservation tax credits.   Most of this activity has been undertaken by a half-dozen smaller developer/investors who recognized South Main's potential, had sufficient financial capacity to acquire and improve buildings, and have been successful in their risks, enabling them to invest in additional projects.   One such investor is Phil Woodard. Owner of a local plumbing business, Woodard used to visit South Main with his father as a child. He purchased his first small building at a modest price in 1994. Today, Woodard has completed ten buildings in South Main and vicinity, all benefiting from a tax freeze the Center City Commission provides to downtown investors, as well as the federal preservation tax credit.   Woodard saw the potential to attract residential tenants to upper-story apartments, with first-floor retail and commercial space. Previous planning work and examples from other jurisdictions suggested that an arts and entertainment focus might work. Artists were recognized as willing to pioneer in untested areas to take advantage of low-cost space. The converted warehouses, factories, and shops offered adaptable space for artists, arts organizations, and restaurateurs. And the trolley promised to bring patrons to the area.   Woodard and his wife Terry joined with other local business partners to create the South Main Association. Artists and gallery owners became interested and began to sign leases, albeit at very low rents. Small businesses have leased much of the first-floor space in renovated buildings, providing services in keeping with the urban lifestyle residential tenants seek.    Signs of success   South Main's success is generating new riders for MATA. Woodard estimates that between 20 and 30 percent of his tenants use the trolley to go to work in the downtown core, a figure he suspects holds for other residential projects in the area. Most of the others commute by car to jobs east of the city center. That may change when MATA completes a new, interconnecting rail line in that direction. Meanwhile, Woodard estimates that almost all tenants use the trolley for evening and weekend use. ""They park their cars on Friday evening and don't get in them again until Monday morning.""   The trolley is bringing more customers to area shops and restaurants. In November 2000 the South Main Association inaugurated a free trolley tour on the last Friday of each month to promote the area. Initially, the association rented the trolley from MATA for $300 per evening, and attracted 50 or 60 people. Within the first year, more than 3,000 riders participated. ""We actually had a problem, because we only had about 18 art galleries on the tour at that time. They were packed to overcapacity. Now, we have about 30 restaurants and shops on the tour, and folks can find enough room,"" says Woodard. MATA and the association now provide the tour in partnership: MATA provides the trolley and operator, while the association offers promotion and advertising.   There is little doubt that the investments in the trolley and Central Station played a major role in alerting investors to the latent opportunities on South Main. Once aware of the opportunities, and with prudent continuing financial assistance, Memphis found that investors were willing to assume the risk of restoring the historic buildings. Because the projects were small, they created an opportunity to test and mature the market. And when the market was proven, the historic properties enabled a number of smaller developer/investors to quickly capitalize on their investments.   Property values in South Main have tripled, according to Woodard: ""When I started, you could buy buildings for $8 a square foot and there were plenty of them. Now, six years later, it's hard to find anything and you have to pay $24 a foot."" But that has not discouraged him from continuing to invest. A handful of projects are underway and more are planned.   The development of South Main produced significant new support for transit not only from the new residential and business expansion along the trolley line, but in the greater Memphis area as well. Having been introduced to rail transit, residents are demanding more. Observing the success at South Main, the business and development community is eager to invest in historic preservation projects adjacent to transit lines.

The EPA and MDE originally sought to make                        the approximately $700 million investment in five years,                        which would have sharply raised annual sewer bills. The                        City of Baltimore originally proposed a 15-year timeline,                        which would have achieved environmental protection, while                        lessening the extreme burden on senior citizens living on                        fixed incomes and other low-income customers. Negotiations                        resulted in a 14-year timeline.                        The agreement will fix sources of sewage overflows                        and update Baltimore's aging wastewater infrastructure.                        But while the federal and State governments required the                        action - which will cost approximately $700 million - by                        threatening litigation, neither is providing any direct                        funding toward this project. Local ratepayers will pay the                        entire cost of this enforcement action.                        A recent draft EPA report found that a $650                        billion investment would be required nationally to address                        this problem. But the Bush Administration and the Congress                        have introduced proposals that provide just $7 billion annually,                        for five years, into state loan pools to pay for improvements.                        According to an April 10, 2002  New                        York Times article  on the draft report: ""The problem,                        many experts say, cannot be solved only with added local                        user fees, because sharp increases would push rates so high                        that no one could pay them and urban economies would stall.""                                             Even                        with increases in water and sewer rates this year, Baltimore                        continues to offer some of the lowest rates in the region                        and along the East Coast. Average quarterly charges for                        Baltimore would increase to $129 under the new agreement.                        Boston charges $211, Atlanta $199, Washington, Dc $175,                        Philadelphia $158 and New York $136 for the same service.                        Montgomery and Prince George's County residents pay $224                        per quarter, Carroll County $222, Baltimore County $172,                        Harford County $171 and Anne Arundel County $159.                        Many                        people will claim credit for the environmental benefit of                        this agreement. But the bill for protecting a national treasure                        - the Chesapeake Bay - will get sent to the poorest jurisdiction                        in the nation's richest state.

As always, thank you for everything you are                        doing to make the greatest city in America even greater.                                             CitiStat: One Call                        For City Hall                       Lately                        a lot of you have been calling our number - 311. In fact,                        in the first two-week period after our official  Call                        Center launch , almost 30,000 calls for information and                        service were received.                        Hardly a  CitiStat                         meeting goes by these days when we don't ""cold call"" the                        311 center to make sure that calls are not only being answered                        promptly and courteously, but that our team of customer                        service representatives are providing callers service request                        tracking numbers so that citizens can regularly check back                        on the status of requests.                        Those service request numbers, also know                        as ""SRs,"" are essentially a receipt for citizens to verify                        that their requests have been registered. CitiStat is constantly                        monitoring departments' SR levels through the automated                        CitiTrack system, keeping close tabs on the public's demand                        for service and the timeliness of their responses.                        Please keep those calls coming. We've recently                        developed target time intervals for the most frequent types                        of service requests. Our 48-hour pothole guarantee and our                        efforts to keep many of Baltimore's gateways clean from                        graffiti, with daily abatements, are just two examples.                        While service requests such as cleaning illegal dump sites                        and vacant properties might take considerably longer, we're                        continuing to do our best to both create and met the public's                        expectations for effective city services.                        CitiStat                        Report of the Week : This week, the Housing Authority                        of Baltimore City (HABC) is online.

Although Marc                        and I sometimes have policy ideas of differing vintages,                        he cares deeply about our city and its people - and works                        every day to keep people thinking about how to make Baltimore                        better.                        It is clearly good news that he had the guts                        to stick his neck out to keep our public radio station in                        local hands. As an occasional guest on his show, I wish                        him luck, and look forward to a new outlet providing local                        news coverage.

GX051-98-9629505	"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Office of Community Planning and Development                   CITIZEN'S SUMMARY   Macon is a central Georgia city of a little over 100,000 persons. Its Consolidated Plan addresses economic and social problems from a family perspective and makes recommendations focusing on the development and expansion of social programs with a holistic, family-centered approach. Macon's problems have mirrored national problems which have decreased family well-being over the years. Conditions have resulted in an inter-generational dependence on the welfare system as a source of income and medical care. The city's approach is that families should receive support to remain intact or to be reunited whenever possible.    Action Plan   For the first year of the Consolidated Plan, the city of Macon is requesting $2,438,030 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, $938,000 in HOME funds, and $86,000 from the Emergency Shelter Grant program. The bulk of Federal funds will be spent on housing programs.   Citizen Participation   A public notice invited citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties to present their input into Macon's Consolidated Plan on May 15, 1995. Another public notice invited nonprofit agencies interested in receiving CDBG funds to a pre-funding conference held in November 30, 1994. All meetings were open to public participation. Survey sheets for citizens' input on priority needs were distributed, and citizens, as well as all other agencies where meetings were held, were asked to complete the survey and return it after the hearing.     MAP 1  depicts points of interest in the jurisdiction.           COMMUNITY PROFILE   The 1990 census showed the population of Macon to be 106,610. Of the total, 52.2 percent are African American, 46.5 percent are white, and only 1.3 percent are from other minority groups.    In 1993 the average annual unemployment rate for Bibb County (in which Macon is located) was 6.1 percent compared to 5.8 percent for the State of Georgia, and 6.8 percent for the Nation. Labor force statistics by race showed that unemployment rates were 3.1 percent for whites and 11 percent for African Americans. Minorities, women, and youth have considerably higher unemployment rates than white males.    Per capita income for Bibb county in 1992 was $18,959. This was less than the national average, but above State and southeastern averages. Median household income for Bibb County in 1990 was $25,813 and for the State it was $29,021.   Census figures reveal that 19.2 percent of the population of Bibb County lived below the poverty level in 1989 ($12,674 for a family of four), compared with 14.6 percent for the State as a whole. Over 19 percent of the population aged 65 years and older lived below poverty in Bibb County, as did 41.1 percent of all female-headed households.    Macon is home to 41,227 households. 71 percent of which have income from wages and salaries. The remainder have income from self-employment, Social Security, public assistance, and retirement. The largest employer is Robins Air Force Base which is located 18 miles south of the city.   The city has a total of 45,499 housing units, 41,175 of them are occupied. Of these, about half are owner occupied and half are renter occupied. Elderly persons head 35 percent of the 21,315 homeowner households. Among these elderly homeowners, 20 percent own or occupy housing that is in need of repair, and almost all of them have incomes at or below 80 percent of the median. Four out of five of them have incomes below 51 percent of median.    Macon had 23,230 rental housing units in 1990 -- 20,730 of which were occupied. This resulted in a vacancy rate just under 11 percent. The census also reported that 35 percent of Macon's 19,912 renter households had incomes at or below 30 percent of median. Of the 7,044 renters with incomes below 30 percent of median, 77 percent lived in housing that needed repair.     MAP 2  depicts points of interest and low-moderate income areas.   MAP 3   depicts points of interest, low-moderate income areas, and minority concentration levels.   MAP 4   depicts points of interest, low-moderate income areas, and unemployment levels.          HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS   Conditions   The 1990 census found that almost one-third of Macon's 41,227 occupied housing units are in need of repair. Of these:     9,339 (23 percent) rental housing units need repair.    3,912 (9 percent) owner-occupied housing units need repair.      Among the non-elderly homeowners that live in housing in need of repair, 25 percent have incomes below 31 percent of median and 18 percent have incomes between 31 and 50 percent of median. Many of these housing units need major repairs to the building envelope; structural members; or to the electrical, plumbing, and heating systems to modernize them and bring them into compliance with all local codes. Typically the costs would run between $25,000 and $30,000 per housing unit. If lead paint must be abated, the cost of completely rehabilitating privately-owned houses jumps to $35,000 to $40,000.    Housing Needs   The demand for affordable and safe housing in inner-city neighborhoods is overwhelming to very low-income homeowners as shown by requests for home repair assistance. Most of the homeowner applicants are elderly persons with Social Security incomes between $400 and $600 per month.   There is a growing demand from low- and moderate-income renters and others to purchase single-family housing. The 7,044 renter households with incomes below 31 percent of median probably will not qualify to purchase a house until their incomes increase. Meanwhile, 77 percent of them live in housing that needs repair, but three-fourths pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and half pay more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs.    As could be expected, there is a large demand for quality, affordable rental housing in Macon, particularly among persons with incomes under 31 percent of median. Unfortunately, debt service alone on high-quality rental housing frequently exceeds 30 percent of the income of very low-income renters.   Affordable Housing Needs   Macon simply does not have the money to address the needs of all low-income homeowners, particularly those with incomes below 50 percent of the median who are unable to borrow a substantial portion of the repair cost from a bank.    The census found that 29 percent of Macon's 41,227 households paid more than 30 percent of their income toward housing costs. Twenty of the 29 percent were renters and 9 percent were owners.    Even more cost burdened were the 13 percent of Macon's households that paid more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs. Ten of 13 percent were renters and 3 percent were owners.   Macon has many inner-city housing needs and problems. The overall state of dilapidation and disinvestment found throughout many inner-city neighborhoods is of primary concern to the city. Therefore, Macon's strategic plan for housing will center on housing activities that can lead to the overall revitalization of inner-city and adjoining neighborhoods.   Homeless Needs   As many as 5,000 households in Macon may be at risk of homelessness in a given year. Persons most threatened with homelessness include:     Persons leaving institutions.     Households with incomes less than 31 percent of median.    Other low-income households with housing costs over 50 percent of income.    Victims of domestic violence.     Non-elderly, low-income single person households.       Macon's homelessness problem is not just confined to single persons in the downtown area. It also pervades single-parent families where children have no permanent residence.    A 1990 study estimated that there were 210 homeless people in downtown Macon, based on occupied shelter beds and a systematic, late night street survey. Detailed interviews of 100 of the 210 homeless found that the overwhelming majority were between 30 to 59 years of age and 91 percent were male. Fifty-one percent were African American, 48 percent were Caucasian, and 1 percent were of other minorities. The average length of homelessness was 2 years but the median for homelessness was 1 year. Twenty-three percent had been previously homeless. The five major causes for homelessness among those surveyed were mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, lack of supportive family relationships, lack of employment, and health-care related issues.   Macon intends to address homelessness by improving the coordination among organizations and agencies delivering services and reducing the number of homeless persons living on the streets and under bridges.   Public and Assisted Housing Needs   The Macon Housing Authority (MHA) has 2,239 units of public housing. It also administers 1,750 Section 8 vouchers and/or certificates. The 1995 5-year plan includes modernization of Anthony Homes public housing. The total cost of modernization is approximately $8 million to be spread over three years. Modernization work is also scheduled for Oglethorpe Homes to complete some lead-based paint abatement.   MHA's Admissions and Continued Occupancy Plan requires MHA to maintain separate waiting lists for handicapped units. In March of 1995, there were 62 units that were designated as handicapped accessible. The current 5-year plan includes funds for an additional 18 handicapped units.    Barriers to Affordable Housing   Although Federal funds are vital to the city's affordable housing, regulations attached to the Federal programs often present obstacles to the city's affordable housing efforts. The city needs additional Federal funding in order to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing to very low-income residents -- many of whom are elderly and live on Social Security incomes of $400 to $600 per month.    The biggest local barriers to inner-city investment and revitalization are drugs and crime. Blight caused by vacant dilapidated houses, overgrown lots, ineffective code enforcement, and an ineffective judicial system are other major barriers. Locally adopted building, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical codes make it difficult to obtain a permit to repair or partially replace a system without having to bring the entire system up to current code. Water and sewer tap fees also add to the cost of inner-city development. Work on some of the needs such as more and better code enforcement and the need to focus money on micro-neighborhoods has already begun.    Fair Housing   Metro Fair Housing Services conducted a study on race discrimination in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Macon as part of a national study funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This study showed that, ""overall, the incidence of housing discrimination was estimated at 56 percent for black renters; 50 percent for Hispanic renters; 59 percent for black homeowners; and 56 percent for Hispanic homebuyers."" One of the questions asked by prospective renters was how many apartments were available. The response to this question exposed the most blatant form of discrimination. A white or majority tester was told of several apartments that he/she could choose and the African-American tester was told that nothing was available. Macon ranked worst among 25 cities in the study in this category. In fact, HUD researchers estimate that an African-American person or couple looking for an apartment in Macon has an almost 60 percent chance of encountering unfair treatment at least once at this stage of the apartment search process.    The Federal Reserve conducted a study in 1991 which showed that African Americans in Macon/Warner Robins were turned down by banks for loans 27 percent of the time compared to 14 percent for white applicants.    Nevertheless, Metro Fair Housing is not aware of any housing discrimination suit against the jurisdiction. The majority of housing discrimination complaints have been in the rental area.   Lead-Based Paint   According to the 1990 census, 5,808 housing units in Macon were built before 1940, and therefore are most likely to have serious lead paint problems. The city has only limited Federal funding it can use to address housing and neighborhood revitalization problems. Given the current level of Federal funding, and the large number of houses needing basic repairs, Macon cannot afford an aggressive lead-based paint abatement, encasement, and/or encapsulation program in privately-owned housing.   According to data provided by the Macon/Bibb County District Public Health Department of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, 1,358 children under the age of 6 were tested for lead poisoning in Macon/Bibb County during 1994. The Health Department, following CDC guidelines, performed initial ""finger stick"" screening tests on the 1,358 children. As a result, 286 or 21 percent of the children were discovered to have lead level readings greater than 10 micrograms/dL. Children who fell into this category were tested a second time. None of these children required medical treatment and none were required to move from their homes.   Community Development Needs   In a survey on priority needs for 1995 Consolidated Plan, the following community development needs were identified by citizens and other agencies that were present in the meeting. These are:      Job training.     Community oriented policing programs.     Education on the homeowner rehabilitation program.     Single room occupancy housing.     Teen pregnancy program.     Homeowner rehabilitation.     Demolish dilapidated housing.     Sidewalk repair.     More coordination among homeless agencies.     Handicap accessibility.     Affordable day care facilities.     Battered women's shelter.     Psychological counseling for battered women and children.     Transportation for homeless people.     More services for the homeless.             HOUSING AND COMMUNITY   DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY   Vision for Change   Macon is striving toward a family-centered system that is comprehensive, preventive, family driven, integrated, developmental, flexible, sensitive to race, culture, gender, and disabilities, and outcome oriented. The following are Macon's community development goals and priorities:     Promote and improve social, physical, and economic environment for low-income families by affording all citizens the opportunity to grow socially, physically, and materially.    Expand and support infrastructure improvements that affect the quality of  life in low-income neighborhoods by improving and developing nonhousing infrastructure.    Strengthen service delivery to special needs populations by decreasing the number of special needs persons without supportive services or housing.    Promote safety and community involvement in low-income neighborhoods by reducing criminal activity in Macon.      Housing Priorities   The city believes that increasing homeownership in inner-city neighborhoods, will serve as a catalyst for private reinvestment. To expand affordable housing opportunities for low-income families Macon plans to:     Continue the housing repair program for low-income homeowners.    Continue the basic housing repair program for emergency repairs.    Promote rental housing repair through the Rental Property Improvement Program.    Promote and support code enforcement activities.    Expand and support neighborhood-based associations.    Encourage, support, and build capacity of nonprofit housing agencies.      Nonhousing Community Development Priorities   Macon also seeks to have a city/county where the rates of unemployment, inactivity, and underemployment are reduced by at least 2 percent.   Antipoverty Strategy   Of the $2,138,000 in CDBG funds that the city will receive, approximately $250,000 will assist nonprofit agencies that deal with problems that contribute to poverty such as low-income, lack of transportation, lack of child care, low self esteem, and lack of job training. More than $1 million of CDBG funds will directly assist low-income homeowners and renters obtain decent, safe, and affordable housing. HOME funds of $938,000 and Emergency Shelter Grants of $86,000 of will assist 40 first-time homebuyers and almost 100 homeless individuals.    Housing and Community Development Resources   Macon will continue to look to the Macon Housing Authority as the major source of quality and affordable housing for very low-income renters. While the city will continue to look for ways to make quality, affordable, and privately owned housing available to renters, the success of the plan will also depend on the availability of private sector financing.    The resources made available through the city, the Middle Georgia Consortium, the Macon Economic Development Council, and the Small Business Administration will provide for the implementation of most of the economic development strategies planned throughout the next 3 years. The primary funding sources for public facilities are the city's General Fund, a Section 108 loan, and CDBG. Funding for public improvements and public services will come from CDBG, with some funds coming from the General Fund. Funding for youth services in Macon comes mostly from public funds with some private nonprofit sources. Three Federal funding sources for the elderly are the Title 3 Older Americans Act, CDBG, and Social Service Block Grants that support nutrition, transportation, adult day care and homemaker services for seniors. Most services for the disabled are funded through the Home- and Community-based Waiver and the Mental Retardation Waiver Plan of the Medicaid Program.   Coordination of Strategic Plan   Economic development strategies will be coordinated primarily through partnerships between the city of Macon, the Middle Georgia Consortium, the Small Business Administration, and the Macon Economic Development Council. All of the public parks and recreational facilities within Macon and Bibb County are operated through the city's Park and Recreation Department. Macon will continue to work with the Junior City Council to ensure that the youth of Macon and Bibb County have their needs addressed. Macon's services network for the elderly and disabled is comprised primarily of governmental and nonprofit agencies that provide supportive housing and services.

A designated Transit Village is a municipality that has been recommended              for designation by the inter-agency Transit Village Task Force. These              municipalities have demonstrated a commitment to revitalizing and              redeveloping the area around its transit facility into a compact,               mixed-use  neighborhood with a strong residential              component.               A municipality can be designated a Transit Village only after much                of the planning and background work has already been done on the                municipal level. It may only be designated a Transit Village after                many of the  Transit Village Criteria                 have been met.                How many designated Transit Villages are there?                There are currently 14 designated Transit Villages. They are Pleasantville              (1999), Morristown (1999), Rutherford (1999), South Amboy (1999),              South Orange (1999), Riverside (2001), Rahway (2002), Metuchen (2003),              Belmar (2003), Bloomfield (2003), Bound Brook (2003), Collingswood              (2003), Cranford (2003) and Matawan (2003).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      South Amboy                                                                             South Orange                                                                            Morristown                                                                                                           What is mixed-use development?                    Mixed-use development is characterized by more than one use                    in a single building, a single development or neighborhood.                    An example is a five-story building with shops and stores on                    the first floor, offices on the second floor and apartments                    on the fourth and fifth floor. Another example is a residential                    block with a deli on one corner and a doctor's office on the                    other corner.                     The objective of mixed-use development is to increase housing                      opportunities within walking distance of shops, jobs, offices,                      restaurants, entertainment and cultural centers. By increasing                      opportunities for pedestrian activity, you reduce reliance                      on the automobile, reduce traffic congestion and pollution,                      boost the local economy and improve the feeling of safety                      and security.                                         What are the benefits of becoming a designated Transit Village?                                        Being designated a Transit Village provides a municipality with                    the following benefits:                                           State of New Jersey commitment to the municipality's vision                        for redevelopment                       Coordination among the state agencies that make up the                        Transit Village task force.
