The  American Civil War  (18611865) was a  civil war  between the  United States of America  (the "" Union "") and the  Southern   slave states  of the newly-formed  Confederate States of America  under  Jefferson Davis . The Union included all of the  free states  and the five slaveholding  border states  and was led by  Abraham Lincoln  and the  Republican Party . Republicans opposed the expansion of  slavery  into territories owned by the United States, and their victory in the  presidential election of 1860  resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office. [ 1 ]  The Union rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .

Battle of Gettysburg - Day One The Battle of Gettysburg was the costliest battle of the Civil War in terms of overall casualties. It was also a major victory for the North. Read about the first day of the battle, July 1, 1863.   Chronological list of Civil War Battles This informative list from Don & Lois Harvey lists each battles and casualty totals for every battle where there was at least one casualty. I have started you off on the 1861 section, from which easy access to the other years is available.   Civil War Battles by State The first page you come to is an overall map pinpointing the individual battles that occurred in the U.S. Civil War.  Under Civil War State Battle Maps you can find all of the battles broken down by state with detailed information concerning participants, casualties, outcomes and more.   Altoona Pass The percentage of participants/casualties was unusually high for the late 1864 Georgia battle. Another nice piece of work from Randy Golden for the ""Welcome to North Georgia"" site.   Battle of Brandy Station--Culpepper, Virginia Some 19,000 mounted men were engaged in this, the greatest cavalry battle ever to take place in the western hemisphere. For the first time in the Civil War, Union cavalry matched the Confederate horsemen in skill and determination.   Chancellorsville: Rumble On the Rappahannok Andrew Dehart's excellent site on this important 1863 battle during which the South suffers a devastating loss with the death of Stonewall Jackson.   Chattanooga Here is the National Park service site on Chattanooga and Chickamauga.   Chickamauga The site of this costly battle ironically translates to ""River of Blood"". Another one of the great ""Blue and Grey Trail"" articles for the North Georgia web site. With nice photos and user-friendly maps.   Battle of Second Manassas The Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862, covering three days, produced 3,399 killed, and brought the Confederacy to the height of its power. The work done on this site by civilwarhome.com gives a brief background, and various articles and reports from those who were there.   The Battle of Olustee The largest Civil War battle in Florida, in proportion to the number of troops involved, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.   Siege of Petersburg Jim Epperson's monumental web site about this massive assault on this crucial site in the Confederacy. I have linked to the ""Petersburg--Why?"" as the intro to the other sections. Includes pictures and maps.   Shiloh Shiloh is a Hebrew word meaning ""place of peace"". It was anything but that in April 1862. More men died in this battle than at the Battle of Waterloo, and was a decisive battle in the war. This brief summary of the battle is from Lee Bruce.                       Free American History Newsletter!

Lee Outcome:  The result of the battle was inconclusive but the north did win a strategic advantage. 23,100 casualties.

President Lincoln saw the significance of this and issued the famous   on September 22, 1862. Overview of the Battle :  On September 16, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan confronted Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Sharpsburg, Maryland. At dawn September 17, Hooker’s corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee’s left flank that began the single bloodiest day in American military history. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller’s cornfield and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. Late in the day, Burnside’s corps finally got into action, crossing the stone bridge over Antietam Creek and rolling up the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill’s division arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside and saving the day. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout the 18th, while removing his wounded south of the river. McClellan did not renew the assaults. After dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley.

Lee renewed his attacks against Porter’s V Corps, which had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain’s Swamp north of the Chickahominy River.

Overview of the Battle :  During the Atlanta Campaign, Sherman maneuvered Johnston's Confederate army out of several successive defensive positions in Cobb County. This strategy spared the Union army from making costly frontal attacks on the well-situated Confederates.  Sherman first found Johnston's army entrenched in the Marietta area on June 9. The Confederate's had established defensive lines along Brushy, Pine, and Lost Mountains. Sherman extended his forces beyond the Confederate lines, causing a partial Rebel withdrawal to another line of positions. After further pressure and skirmishing from Union forces, Johnston withdrew to an arc-shaped position centered on Kennesaw Mountain on June 18 and 19. Sherman made some unsuccessful attacks on this position but eventually extended the line on his right and forced Johnston to withdrawal from the Marietta area on July 2-3.
