GX030-68-7479432	"REGIONAL PROJECT NO.: S-272 DC 95-06            TITLE: Development of Textile Materials for       Environmental Compatibility and Human Health and Safety            DURATION: October 1, 1996, to September 30, 2001            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM            The U.S. public increasingly recognizes the need       to reduce wastes and/or make products having enhanced biodegradation       potential. This ties in to the need to create value-added products from       agricultural products/wastes/derivatives to achieve economically viable       agricultural production systems. This project involves developing newer       textile materials (value-added products) and processes that will improve       existing textiles and other polymeric materials. The objectives of this       project also address performing consumer end-use testing and making market       acceptability determinations of the innovative products. These research       efforts are expected to lead to the development of environmentally       compatible textile products that contribute to human health and safety,       and also help revitalize the agricultural and rural economics.            JUSTIFICATION            Environmental responsibility is becoming the       cornerstone of most major industries in the United States. Increased       consumer awareness, tighter restrictions, new regulations and increased       enforcement policies during the 1990's have been critical in the       development of new technologies, products and programs that address       environmental issues. Today, substantial evidence indicates that       environmental concerns have a major impact on consumers when making       purchasing decisions. Consumers are willing to pay, on average, 6.6% more       to purchase selected environmentally friendly products (Hager, 1990).       Consumer researcher Wiseman (Apodaca, 1992) and Esprit International       (Brookhart, 1991) stated that awareness of environmental issues also has       influenced company attitudes. Hence, addressing and solving environmental       concerns will continue to have a significant impact on the direction of       research. There is a need for development and assessment of new textile       and other polymeric products and processes that are environmentally       friendly, especially, since textiles are found in an unlimited number and       variety of products.            Six research initiatives were recently outlined       as research priorities (ESCOP, 1994). Under one of these priorities,       Environment and National Resources, the primary focus was on how to       Recover and Use Waste Resources through Agricultural and Forestry Systems.       Under a second priority, Processes and Products, the two major issues were       Processing By-products to Beneficial Uses and the Development of New or       Improved Non-Food Products. And, under a third research priority, Economic       and Social Issues, two important issues, Enhancement of Agricultural and       Rural Economics and Empowering People for Economic and Social Viability,       were addressed. Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences FY 1997,       has also listed their five goals which are similar to ESCOP research       initiatives. The research thrust of the new project will address Joint       Council's first goal which is to achieve economically viable agricultural       production systems that are compatible with environmental and social       values. The new proposed project falls well within the ESCOP high-priority       research initiatives.            Several goals enumerated in the Southern       Strategic Research Plan (Dec. 1994) provide an impetus for continued       development of new textile materials from agricultural waste and       by-products. Development of new value-added products from agricultural       crops and by-products will enhance the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture       and assure American dominance in a global economy. In response to USDA       initiatives and goals, new textile materials from agricultural products       are being developed by Experiment Station scientists. Commercialization of       these products will enhance the profitability of agricultural enterprises       in the US and provide more economic opportunities for producers of these       crops.            The previous research project (S-250) dealt with       the assessment of environmental compatibility of textiles and other       polymeric materials. Solid waste reduction has been demonstrated as one       viable way of dealing with waste; altering existing products to make them       more environmentally friendly may be a better approach in the long run.       This proposed project addresses three major areas of research: (1)       development and characterization of environmentally compatible value-added       products from existing agricultural crops; (2) development and       characterization of processes that will improve existing textile and       polymeric materials, making them safer for human use; and (3) comparison       of the functional performance and marketability of these products with the       competing products already existing in the market. All of these research       objectives can only be achieved or accomplished through cooperative       research because they involve diverse products grown and processed in       various parts of the United States.            Kenaf is being investigated as an alternative       crop for farmers in many states, including California, Mississippi, Texas,       Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The major use for kenaf has       been in the production of pulp for paper, but the appearance of other       kenaf products on the market recently has expanded the use of and interest       in this fiber. Kenaf blends have the potential for penetrating the markets       for disposable nonwovens in the medical field, such as drape sheets, and       sterilization wraps and interior furnishing materials such as wallpaper       and carpet backing. Apparel including high-fashion garments, and where       texture and aesthetics are important, can be constructed of kenaf blends;       however, this may well be a niche situation. Production and evaluation of       prototype woven and nonwoven kenaf fabrics will contribute necessary data       on product quality and utility as agricultural producers consider       investment in kenaf as an alternative crop.            Researchers in Louisiana, a state with       significant sugarcane production, have developed processes for conversion       of sugar cane rind into textile and geotextile products. Traditional sugar       processing crushes the entire sugar cane stalk to obtain the sucrose from       which refined sugar is processed. The crushed stalks, or bagasse,       remaining from such processing have been used in low-value applications       such as fuel for the processing mill or animal feed. Development of higher        value-added products would enhance sugar mill operation and provide       additional end uses for the high volume of bagasse by-product.            Agricultural byproducts obtained from the       Midwest's major commodities (soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and wheat)       potentially could be used to produce a multitude of innovative value-added       non-food products, ranging from fibers and films to finishing agents. For       the last five years, a major research emphasis at Kansas State University       (KSU) has been to examine non-food uses of soybean byproducts in a variety       of textile applications because of its economic importance to the state.       Preliminary work has been done on utilizing a variety of agricultural       by-products in textile manufacturing and processing, such as the potential       use of tocopherols; soybean-based binders in pigment printing;       polyethylene films; and new fiber reactive finishing compounds. Further       work is needed on evaluating the aforementioned compounds.            Water and air pollution from textile processing       is still a major problem. Innovative methods and products to achieve       pollution prevention and source reduction are being addressed by the newly       developed One Atmosphere Plasma Process and Low Pressure Plasma Treatment       at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville) and Wisconsin. Applications for       these processes include the treatment of melt blown nonwovens made of       normally unwettable polypropylene (PP) making them wettable. These plasm       processes can also make other synthetic fabrics more wettable so they can       be dyed and printed with the more environmentally friendly water soluble       dyes and pigments as opposed to solvent based systems.            An area related to indoor air quality is the       maintenance of indoor relative humidity. As indoor relative humidities       increase, occupant comfort decreases while the probability of allergic       reactions and pathogenic illnesses increase. In addition to the health       risks, high indoor relative humidities have an adverse effect on building       materials. Moisture absorption/desorption in building materials,       especially fabrics, can have significant effects on cooling       dehumidification devices. Fabrics normally found in the interior of       buildings (cotton, rayon) can be used to develop a fabric/desiccant window       cavity dehumidifier that uses solid desiccants embedded in the fabric       structure to dehumidify room air in commercial and residential buildings.            The wearing of protective apparel is highly       recommended for all people occupationally exposed to ultraviolet       radiation, sunlight, pesticides, blood and body fluids. Therefore, there       is a continued interest in the development of textile systems for human       safety, namely, medical, agricultural and sun protective clothing.            The large numbers of patents known to be infected       with bloodborne pathogens makes it vital for all healthcare providers to       use precaution and treat all body fluids as infectious. The precarious       nature of this work makes it critical that all healthcare employers       determine the risk of infection of their employees and equip them with the       required level of protective apparel in compliance with the Occupational       Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. The OSHA estimates that       more than 5.6 million healthcare and public safety workers are at       potential risk of being exposed to human immunodeficiency (HIV) or       hepatitis B (HBV) viruses (OSHA, 1992). Accordingly, OSHA has issued a       mandate on personal protective equipment (PPE) with the long term goal of       reducing the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne viruses. PPE       items include surgical gowns, drapes, aprons, and masks.            Concern among healthcare professionals about       infection has created a heightened interest in nonwovens research to       develop barrier materials providing the highest level of protection. Also,       the environmental costs of medical waste disposal are rising, and a survey       of medical protective clothing use suggests that, for both purchasers and       wearers of medical clothing, biodegradability will be of concern (Brandt &       Swift, 1993). This creates the unique opportunity for agricultural fibers       such as kenaf and cotton to be included in composite nonwoven structures       for such medical applications. Natural fibers have two distinctive       advantages over synthetics: they are moisture absorbent and therefore more       comfortable; and they are biodegradable, making them ideal for disposable       products.            Skin cancer rates have increased dramatically       over the past 50 years, most of them caused by excessive exposure to       ultraviolet radiation from the sun (Jaroff, 1990). In recent years many       individuals began to use chemical sunscreens rather than clothing for       photoprotection. However, sunscreens frequently are not uniformly applied       and are removed or diminished in efficacy by water or sweating. In       addition, sunscreens cause hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals        thereby limiting or precluding their use. Consequently, there is renewed       interest in the development and evaluation of sun-protective clothing.            Another area of interest related to       sun-protective clothing is  Acetobacter xylinum  cellulose which       can be a potential candidate for value added textile products,       specifically products that can provide UVR protection. In addition, the       secreted cellulose can be molded or shaped to specific forms such as caps       and gloves.  Acetobacter xylinum  is a gram negative soil       bacterium that secretes cellulose. The cellulose synthesized is chemically       and structurally identical to that produced by higher plants. Therefore,       possibilities of producing a value-added product from this bacterium       exist.            The Agricultural Worker Protection Standards       specify that the required PPE and clothing be listed on pesticide product       labels. Because most protective clothing specified is reused,       pesticide-contaminated protective clothing needs to be decontaminated       before reuse to minimize human exposure. Previous studies have indicated a       need for research on understanding the sorption and retention properties       of the innovative textile substrates in a protective clothing system to        provide a theoretical framework for chemical retention and release from       textile substrates (newly developed and existing fabrics).            This multi-faceted research agenda must be       well-organized, and a cooperative effort is the only feasible way to       accomplish all the goals of the project within a reasonable period of       time. Also, some laboratories are better equipped to carry out particular       aspects of the research. For example, the University of Tennessee,       Louisiana State University, Kansas State University, and Mississippi State       University are in the forefront of product development research. Other       research laboratories such as the University of Nebraska, University of       Georgia, University of Kentucky, Purdue University, University of       Wisconsin, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Florida State       University, Auburn University, and University of Arkansas have the       expertise to characterize fabrics, evaluate functional performance,       conduct environmental compatibility research and determine marketability.            The objectives listed in this proposal can only       be accomplished efficiently through cooperative research studies. In       total, we have capable scientists from 13 universities/experiment stations       that have pledged their support and participation. The broad spectrum of       scientific and technical expertise offered by the participating       cooperative states is of the highest caliber and includes textile       chemistry, agricultural value-added product development research,       fabrication, wear-study, environmental sciences, environmental toxicology,       consumer acceptance and market assessibility. Many different crops,       processing facilities, textile testing equipment, and a great variety of       nonwoven equipment/facilities are needed to accomplish the objectives       outlined herein. No single university/experiment station alone has the       full resources required to produce the value-added products and adequately       assess end-use performance characteristics. Also, funding required to       accomplish such broad and comprehensive research goals is substantial.       Therefore, RRF funding is required and necessary.            The significance of the research proposal       presented, the broad and comprehensive model for the holistic approach to       value-added product development research, and the cooperation of the 10       states fit very well with the mission of an RRF project. This project is       the only cooperative effort addressing the various topics related to       value-added product development, processes to improve textile and       polymeric materials, consumer-end-use performance testing and market       acceptability of these innovative products.            Results of the proposed research project will       benefit agricultural producers by providing higher returns;       manufacturers/industries by making/selling environmentally friendly       products; and consumers by providing high quality product alternatives.       This cooperative research effort will add value to agricultural products       and create new business/product opportunities that will help revitalize       the agricultural and rural economics by minimizing the environmental and       economic impacts of wastes which can be converted into usable products.            Contributions to science and technology will       include product development, consumer-end-use performance of these       products, market acceptability of environmentally friendly products,       environmentally compatible new production processes, determination of the       economic viability of local industries based on alternative uses of       agricultural and renewable resources, and development of appropriate       technology to support these industries.            RELATED CURRENT AND PREVIOUS WORK            Regional project S-250, Assessment of the       Environmental Compatibility of Textiles and Other Polymeric Materials       (terminates September 30, 1996) focused on the assessment of environmental       compatibility, weather and photodegradation, and soil composting of a       variety of fiber and filament materials. It also investigated the       possibility of incorporating agricultural products into non-woven       materials and the possibility of using recycled polyester in the       construction of nonwoven fabrics. The proposed research described herein       will investigate the characteristics, performance and market potential of       altered agricultural by-products (or value-added products). Improved       processes that will make textile and polymeric materials more       environmentally friendly and useful for human health and safety, will be       studied.            Equipment, processes and expertise relative to       fiber (kenaf and sugar cane) processing, non-food soybean by-products       synthesis, plasma-membrane finishing, soil burial protocols, etc., which       were developed through S-250 project will be utilized in the proposed       project under some of the objectives listed.            Under the AGRICOLA system, all the listed       research related to this project has an environmental compatibility       aspect, however, all these projects have been or are soon to be       terminated. In general, these studies support the need for more research       on the development of various environmentally friendly processes and       products. Functional performance and market potential are very significant       areas of research.             Development of New Value-Added       Agricultural By-Products and Processes.            In 1986 the Kenaf Demonstration Project was       started in cooperation with USDA and Kenaf International with the primary       goal of making the kenaf industry a reality in the U.S. Kenaf newsprint       has proven to be a market-ready commodity. In 1991 efforts on kenaf began       to focus more on market development for separated kenaf fiber products       made from bast and core materials (Taylor and Kugler, 1992).            Work has been done to develop methods for       processing fibers (Ramaswamy et al., 1993a, 1994a). In addition, research       on differences in fiber quality of kenaf varieties has been conducted       (Ramaswamy et al., 1993b, Boyd et al., 1993). The next phase has involved       processing fibers so that they may be incorporated into nonwoven and woven       textiles (Ramaswamy et al., 1994a, 1994b, 1995a). Various treatments for       obtaining soft, pliable fibers were screened and tested to select the best       process for large-scale production (Ramaswamy & Craft, 1994c;       Ramaswamy et al., 1995b).            A recent trend in bast/leaf fiber research is the       search for unconventional fibers to be used in fabrics. The apparel       industry, especially women's ready-to-wear and haute couture, is always       looking for interesting textures. Kenaf/cotton blends could provide that       exciting texture for this limited market. Also, kenaf/cotton fabrics may       have a promising future in industrial fabrics for end-uses such as       wallcovering and carpet backing and for upholstery and draperies.            Appearance is another major characteristic of a       textile product which determines it acceptability by consumers.       Specifically, new fibers must be able to accept dyes and finishes in order       to meet aesthetic and performance property expectations. The permeability       of a fiber is typically regarded as the most crucial aspect of a fiber's       ability to be dyed or finished. Knowledge about the permeability of a dye       in a fiber, both in terms of the speed and volume of dyeing, is critical       for the dyeing industry. Specifically, this knowledge can be translated       into cost savings for the dyer by knowing which dyeing conditions will       produce better dye yield, leveling, fixation, and colorfastness properties       (McGregor, 1980).            Sugar cane is produced in large quantities in       several southern states. In most current processing, the cane stalks are       crushed to extract the sugar, and the crushed stalks, or bagasse, are then       used for fuel or mulch or are discarded. Attempts to find economical uses       for this by-product have not been particularly successful. Researchers at       Louisiana State University (LSU) have developed processes for extracting       the longer, finer fibers from the rind of sugar cane after separating it       from the pith that contains shorter thicker fibers (Collier & Arora,       1995; Collier, B.J., et al., 1995a; Collier, et. al., 1992a). The process       (patent pending) uses the Tilby separator to remove the pith from the rind       and alkaline treatment and/or steam explosion to extract fibers from the       rind. Sugar cane rind fibers were formed into nonwoven mats and compared       with commercial erosion control mats in laboratory tests (Collier, J.R.,       et al., 1995b; Thames, et al., 1994).            <             A current field study of sugar cane mats and       commercial products is being conducted in cooperation with the Louisiana       Transportation Research Center (LTRC). Preliminary work has begun on       producing mat or spray-on erosion control materials directly from bagasse,       without the separation of rind and pith. LSU scientists have used similar       extraction processes to obtain fibers from kenaf stalks. Kenaf mats,       similar to the sugar cane erosion control mats, were produced and        evaluated. Properties were similar to those of the sugar cane materials.       Further product modifications and trials are needed to assess the       marketability of these geotextile products.            A variety of non-food application of soybean       byproducts for textile applications have been investigated at KSU.       Czarnecki and Gatewood (1995) evaluated the potential use of alpha- and       delta-tocopherois to reduce light degradation in silk, cotton, polyester,       and nylon. However, they were not effective in reducing degradation in the       synthetic fibers, and had a pro-oxidant effect, which would limit their       commercial usefulness. One important non-food use for soybean oil has been       in the manufacturing of alkyd binders which are incorporated into various       coating formulations. Results of printing trials conducted on cotton and       cotton/polyester blend fabrics show that the ease of application,       sharpness of print, and depth of shade of the alkyd binders are comparable       to the conventional acrylic binder, but the fastness to laundering,       dry-cleaning, and crocking was slightly less. The alkyd binder pigment       printing systems show considerable promise, but additional work is needed       to improve fastness properties.            Hamilton and Gatewood (1994) investigated soybean       protein as an alternative filler because of the extensive limitations of       the starch-filled plastic trash bags. Currently, KSU scientists have       successfully prepared polyethylene films containing 40% fatty acids. Also       to be explored is the feasibility of incorporating the fatty acids into       other melt spun fibers and plastics (polyamides and polyethylene       terephthalate) to enhance biodegradability. The oils and fatty acids in        soybeans can also be used to synthesize a wide variety of finishing agents       and auxiliaries for textile dyeing and finishing. Srinivasan (1995)       synthesized a unique fiber reactive softener based on an unsaturated       soybean fatty acid (oleic acid) and cyanuric chloride. The newly       synthesized softener reduced stiffness and improved the flame resistance       of cotton. This basic chemistry offers numerous possibilities for the use       of soybean derivatives in textile processing and finishing.            Development of Processes to Improve       Environmental Compatibility of Textiles and Polymeric Materials            The textile industry has been ranked as the       seventh-worst polluter of the United States waters by the Environmental       Protection Agency under section 304( 1 ) of the Clean       Water Act (CWA) (LaMenzo, 1993). The large quantity of water and variety       of solvents, metals and other target chemicals used in processing       contribute to this ranking. Across all industries, the cost to comply with       treatment for the pollutants is overwhelming. It has been estimated that       the cost for treating metal alone will be between 90 and 105 billion       dollars (Nichols, 1992). Therefore, modifying processes to be more       environmentally friendly is a sensible alternative requiring immediate       attention. Introduction of Tencel®, a cellulosic fiber made via a       solvent spinning process that does not pollute, genetically colored cotton       and organic cotton are a few examples of the new trends seen in the       textile marketplace. These products have a positive environmental image       and are desired by the consumer.            Another topic that raises increased concern is       the quality of indoor air (Baer, 1992). This concern has led to the       evaluation of textiles and textile containing products in indoor       environments. Studies            have shown that indoor air is more polluted than       outdoor air, especially in ""tight"" buildings (Legwold, 1994).       Factors that affect indoor air quality are finishes, furnishings, building       materials, people activity and technology. Topical finishes on fabrics       contain hazardous ingredients that may exist as latent primary emissions.       Commercial durable press finishes for cotton and cotton blends contain       formaldehyde which can be released under hot humid conditions. Concern has       been expressed both in the U.S. and abroad over the health hazard of such       formaldehyde release. Standard measurement methods are static, determining       formaldehyde release under equilibrium specified conditions; therefore       they do not stimulate actual use conditions.            To determine formaldehyde release under       conditions that simulate actual use, a dynamic chamber for exposure to       durable press fabrics has been developed by scientists at the Southern       Regional Research Center, New Orleans. However, the chamber does not       control temperature and humidity independently. An apparatus developed at       LSU features computer control of two valves for control of wet and dry air       flow which will determine the relative humidity in the chamber. Previous        work determined that release of formaldehyde was lower at higher       temperatures for each of two relative humidities tested (Collier et al.,       1992b). A model has been developed to predict formaldehyde release under a       variety of conditions and can also be used to determine the relative       contribution of fabric type and finish to release.            Research has shown that indoor relative humidity       levels above 50% increase the dust mite population, and indoor relative       humidity levels above 70% provide an excellent environment for growth of       fungi (Sterling et al. 1985). Fungi and dust mites are identifiable causes       of asthma and hay fever. Infiltration of high-humidity air (through doors,       windows, cracks, or walls) has been reported to produce condensed moisture       on walls, cause vinyl materials (wall paper) to pull from surfaces, and       break down gypsum dry wall (Shakun 1992; Aulbach et al, 1991). Residential       air conditioners (a potential solution to humidity problems) have been       described as being inadequate to control indoor humidity for hot and humid       climates (Kohlos 1981). Hunn et al. (1994) evaluated fabrics--for shades,       curtains, wall coverings, or other interior furnishings--and system       concepts that employ these fabrics, which absorb and desorb water vapor so       as to dehumidify room air. The results indicated that the proposed       fabric/desiccant window cavity dehumidifier exhibits satisfactory       dehumidification performance. More work is needed to identify other types       of desiccants (that have good moisture absorption desorption properties)       to be used in the fabric/desiccant window cavity dehumidifier.            Researchers at the Textiles and Nonwovens       Development Center (TANDEC) at the University of Tennessee (TN) have       developed the means to make hydrophobic fibers such as polypropylene (PP)       wettable and even rewettable for an extended length of time. This new       affinity for water should increase the accessability of the fibers to dyes       and finishes, and thereby enable lower energy processing with less       pollution (Tsai et al., 1994). The technology is based on a novel       atmospheric plasma reactor, which is capable of generating a uniform,       steady state glow discharge plasma at one atmosphere in air and other       gases. The active species from this plasma can be applied to fabrics as       part of a continuous production process (Roth et al., 1993). Some of the       variables which must be controlled are the gas or gas mixture used; the       exposure time; the type of fabric; the magnitude of the RF electric field       and its frequency; the gas flow rate and flow geometry; and the ambient       temperature and humdity. Each of these variables produces an effect on the       wettability, wickability, and other surface features of the fabric, which       affect its commercial utility.            The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA)       analyses of treated melt-blown PP fibers has confirmned that durability of       the hydrophilic effect is achieved under optimum conditions. Thus, it may       not be necessary for the fabrics or other plasma treated materials to be       immediately dyed or printed, as would typically be the case. Furthermore,       the plasma treated and dyed or printed PET and PP textiles may be mroe       comfortable to wear and have greater versatility if the hydrophilic       property can be maintained. There are some challenges that need to be       faced, such as: which wettability and wickability characteristics are of       commercial interest; which independent variables will produce the desired       characteristics for dyeing and printing applications; and which physical       mechanism(s) wil produce the desired effects on the surface.            Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have       worked on synthetic and natural fibers to improve their physical and       chemical properties. They used low pressure plasma treatment to improve       dyeability, printability, water absorbency/repellency, surface grafting       and metalizing to generate protective layers with enhanced properties of       abrasion resistance, surface hardness, heat resistance and electric       conductivity (Ying, et al, 1995, Sarmadi, et al (in press), Sarmadi and        Denes (in press), Sarmadi, et al, 1995a, Sarmadi, et. al., 1993, Sarmadi,       et. al., 1993b).            Development of Textile Systems for Human       Health and Safety.            The Occupational Safety and Health Administration       passed regulation in 1991 that require employers to provide workers       exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids with garments       that are effective barrier to blood and blood borne pathogens (OSHA,       1992). In addition to health care workers, patients must be provided       protection in the form of surgical wraps, drapes and other textile       products that protect them by preventing fluid or liquid penetration.       These textile systems must be resistant to penetration of bacteria, virus,       blood and other body fluids and should be safely disposed. Many of the       textile systems developed in this project will be good candidates for       medical protective clothing.            The protective clothing of agricultural workers       is assumed to protect workers from exposure to pesticides. However, when       clothing containing pesticide residues comes in contact with skin in the       presence of moisture, particularly perspiration, water-soluble pesticides       can be absorbed into the body, which may cause potentially serious health       hazards. Fabrics should not wet or wick the pesticide formulation, blood       or body fluids. Recent studies (Hobbs, et al, 1986; Sarmadi, et al, 1993c)       have also shown that fabrics treated with low surface tension liquid       repellents (LSTLR) such as fluorochemical (FC) treatment, have enhanced       barrier properties against liquid penetration.            An expanse of literature can be found concerning       laundering methods, variables, and efficiency in removing pesticide       residues (Laughlin and Gold, 1988, Easter, 1983). The sorption and       retention properties of pesticide chemicals by the textile substrate are       the most important variables in determination of chemical exposure to, and       removal from, protective clothing. Sorption isotherms of insecticide can       be easily adapted to measure the retention capacity of textile substrates.       Sorption isotherms may provide a relatively quick and inexpensive method       for obtaining basic information needed to compare the quantity of       pesticides retained by the various textile substrates that will be tested       in this project for use as agricultural protective clothing.            Liquid flow measurements are very critical to the       performance of these newly altered textile structures, for protective       clothing. Wilhelmmy Balance techniques can also be used to determine the       surface energetics of single fibers by measuring the attractive forces       across the interface between a liquid surface and a partially immersed       fiber (Miller and Young, 1975). Liquid flow in porous materials is       commonly described by the Washburn equation (1921), which state that the        distance (H) traveled by the liquid is directly proportional to the square       root of time (t). Measurements of liquid flow through the newer textile       structures that are developed will help to understand the performance of       these structures.            Sun protection programs promote the use of sun       protective clothing in addition to sunscreen and avoidance of continual       exposure. Sun exposure causes damage such as sunburn, skin cancer and       premature aging. Clothing is a highly effective and easy form of       protection compared to sunscreens which require frequent application and       sometimes cause hypersensitivity. Berne and Fischer (1980) examined       various textiles and found that tightly woven materials and darker colors       offered best protection from the sun. Welsh and Diffey (1981) also       reported that fabric structure was the critical factor in determining the       sun-protective value of a textile and not color or thickness. Robson and       Diffey (1990) also confirmed that the fabric construction was more       critical than fiber content; however, they excluded nylons in their study.       Jevtic (1990) studied human exposure to solar simulator and concluded that       a wet fabric will provide less protection. Unfortunately, in the studies       conducted to date, the textiles were imcompletely and even inaccurately       characterized. A review article (Capjack et al. 1994) summarizes findings       and limitations of previous research. Further studies are needed to       systematically investigate the parameters (fabric construction, fiber       content, color and finish) that influence sun protective value of textile       systems.            Another       important area in sun protection is the cellulose produced by  Acetobacter         xylinum . Work by Williams and Cannon (1989) suggests that the       cellulose produced by  Acetobacter   xylinum  has the       capability of protecting bacterial cells from ultraviolet light exposure.       Kuga and Brown, Jr. (1989) analyzed the correlation between the       crystalline structure and the biogenic mechanism and suggested that the       crystalline structure and the presence of the pores through which the       cellulose is extruded contributes to strength, moisture absorbency, and       dyeability of the cellulose produced. However, no evidence of quantitative       data for these properties or others have been found in the literature.       Therefore,  Acetobacter   xylinum  will be cultured and       studied for its sun protective properties.            OBJECTIVES            1. To develop and characterize innovative textile       and related materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis       on agricultural fibers and by-products            2. To assess the environmental compatibility of       selected and newly developed, processes, materials and products from       fibers of polymeric and agricultural origin            3. To evaluate the functional performance,       consumer acceptance and potential commercialization of textile materials       for human health and safety and/or value-added products            PROCEDURES            Objective 1. To develop and       characterize innovative textile and related materials from natural and       synthetic polymers with an emphasis on agricultural fibers and by-products            Development of new value added products       from kenaf and sugar cane and other agricultural crops.            At MSU kenaf fibers will be produced by chemical       retting, softened, and mechanically carded to obtain staple fibers.       Kenaf/cotton yarns will be spun and woven as filling yarns with 100%       cotton warp yarns in plain, twill, basket, and satin weaves.       Characterization of the woven fabrics will include: tensile strength,       tearing strength, abrasion resistance, stiffness, moisture regain, air       permeability, dyeing behavior, colorfastness to laundering, light,       crocking, and perspiration and evaluation of soil repellent and flame       retardant finishes. Kenaf fibers produced at MSU will also be blended with       PP in an 80:20 ratio and carded to make nonwoven webs. The webs will be       needle punched and cured at high pressures to make nonwoven fabrics for       wall-covering substrates. Webs will also be calendered to produce nonwoven       textiles for furniture underlays, mattress liners, and other disposable       products. These products will be characterized and compared with current       commercial products for thickness, weight, tearing strength, abrasion       resistance, stiffness and tensile strength and also compared with product       performance specifications. Since no one station has all the testing       equipment required, various combinations of tests will be performed at       various laboratories (MS, FL, IN, and GA).            At LSU fibers extracted from kenaf and sugar cane       rind will be characterized and spun into yarns. Textile spinning equipment       suitable for processing long-staple fibers will be acquired with a grant       awarded by the Louisiana Education Quality Support Fund (LEQSF). Yarns and       knitted fabric from the yarns will be characterized and will also be dyed       to determine the dyeing characteristics of the sugar cane and kenaf       textiles. Nonwoven mats of bagasse will be produced by alkaline treatment       of bagasse and subsequent screening to eliminate shorter fibers. The mats       will be evaluated for strength, water resistance, light penetration,       biodegradation and flammability and compared to earlier benchmark data       obtained for the 100% rind fibers (Collier, J. R., et al, 1995; Thames, et       al, 1994). Formulations will be developed for a spray-on erosion control       product using sugar cane or kenaf fibers and guar gum (LA, AL, and GA).            These studies will be conducted by the       cooperation of MS, IN, FL, GA, LA and AL. Mississippi and Louisiana will       assume coordination and leadership responsibilities. Product development       work, characterizations and field studies will be done by MS and LA. The       basic research in dyeing of kenaf and/or sugar cane incorporated textiles       will be performed in cooperation with IN. Many of the mechanical and       physical properties will also be performed by FL and GA in cooperation        with MS and LA. Data from two to three stations will be collectively       analyzed and inter-laboratory comparisons made. Interdependence and       cooperation among various states will be reflected in joint publications       in highly respected research journals. Several standard ASTM and AATCC       test methods have been identified and the specifics will be determined       when project approval is obtained. This research is clearly recognized as       being largely developmental in nature and a substantial degree of risk of       failure is evident. However, the potential for developing new value-added       products from agricultural crops is considered as worthy justification for       the studies.            Development of polymeric materials from       agricultural derivatives and evaluate their physical properties and       suitability for specific end-uses.            Films and related polymeric materials will be       produced by incorporating soybean fatty acids into synthetic polymer to       enhance biodegradability. A two-step film preparation method using a Wiley       Mill grinder, a CSI laboratory extruder, and a Carver press will be       adapted to make films under high temperature and pressure. The Carver       press also can be used to mold the films into specific products. The       laboratory prepared films will be tested for variations in thickness,       weight, strength, stiffness, melting point, color and opacity, and       biodegradability using appropriate AATCC and ASTM test methods. After       evaluating the physical properties and performance characteristics of the       films, possible product categories will be explored. Also to be explored       is the feasibility of producing a wheat straw board using modified wheat       starch as a resinous binder (KS, GA).            Additional fiber reactive softeners will be       synthesized from linoleic and linoleic acids from soybean oil and compared       with commercial fabric softeners. The soybean-based fiber reactive       softeners will be applied to cotton fabrics by a pad-dry-cure procedure       using a Mathis pad-steam range, simulating commercial open width       finishing. The stiffness, whiteness, strength, elongation, absorbency,       flammability, and other attributes of the fabrics treated with the       conventional and experimental softeners will be evaluated using standard       AATCC and ASTM test procedures, and compared to the softener from oleic       acid (KS, NC).            The development and characterization of polymeric       materials from soybean derivatives will be conducted by KS, GA and NC with       KS assuming coordination and leadership responsibilities. Films and other       polymeric materials, softeners will be made by KS and further       characteristics, product testing will be done in cooperation with GA and       NC. For example GA will conduct x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to       evaluate biodegradation of the above polymeric materials. Evaluation of        the fiber reactive softeners will be done both by KS and NC. Data will be       compared between two or more laboratories and jointly analyzed.       Publications will reflect interdependence and cooperation. Comparisons of       costs of the soybean derivatives and other similar derivatives will be       made.            Development of One Atmosphere Plasma       Treatment for Lower Energy Consumption and Less Polluting Processing of       Polymeric Materials.            Nonwoven, woven and knitted fabrics will be       exposed to a systematically varied range of parameters which affect the       wettability, wickability and subsequent wet processing of the fabrics.       This will establish the conditions under which an in-line industrial       atmospheric plasma process should function to produce acceptable dyed or       printed fabrics with minimum air and water pollution. This will require       the development of novel plasma diagnostic methods for this one atmosphere        glow discharge, to measure the power density, electron number density,       electron kinetic temperature, ion kinetic temperature, operating voltage,       rms electric field, RF frequency, as well as gas flow characteristics such       as flow rate, composition, humidity, and uniformity of the flow pattern.            The fabrics will be characterized before and       after plasma surface treatments using the techniques of x-ray       photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA), ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy and scanning       electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with measurement of the contact       angle, surface tension, wettability, wickability, and the quality of dyed       and printed fabrics that can be produced (TN, GA, AR, and NC).            TN will develop many of the diagnostic methods       and apply the treatment. Since the techniques for characterization are       very specialized, each state uses a different technique to characterize       the fabrics before and after plasma treatment. Results will be compared       between techniques to reflect understanding of the effects of the plasma       treatment.            Development of Low Pressure Plasma       Treatment and Cotton/Microporous Film Based Nonwovens with Enhanced       Barrier and Comfort Properties.            A hot melt adhesive will be melt blown between       the interfaces of nonwoven substrates, cotton webs, and microporous       polyethylene films, thereby enabling the layered structures to be bonded       at ambient conditions between a low pressure nip. Instead of using thermal       point bonding, the pressure sensitive adhesive will be melt blown to       produce a very light weight web of 3-5 g/m2 which can bond the laminate       layers at the interfaces as the laminate is passed between a single nip of       rubber coated rollers. At least five different fabric compositions will be       prepared at a width of one meter based upon adhering different weights of       melt blown and spunbond polypropylene nonwovens to an inner core of       microporous polyethylene filler/cotton based nonwoven. By virtue of their       unique combination of barrier and comfort properties, it is believed that       these laminates will be suitable candidates for protective apparel       (medical, agricultural and industrial) (TN, WI, GA, KY).            Kenaf/PP webs will be processed to make nonwoven       fabrics and treated with low pressure plasma treatment for surgical       sterilization wraps. Cotton in various nonwoven structures will be       produced using selected bonding mechanisms and evaluated for physical       characteristics. Testing of all fabrics for stability in water, reuse and       dyeing processes, absorption and moisture transfer properties, frictional       characteristics and sewability will be conducted (AL, AR and MS).            TN and WI will develop the appropriate conditions       for the treatments and the fabrics will be characterized using       laboratories in TN, WI, GA, AL, AR, KY, and MS. The same fabrics will be       used in Objective 3 for functional performance. Data from cooperating       laboratories will be jointly analyzed and published to reflect cooperation       of various laboratories and states.            Objective       2. To assess the environmental compatibility of selected and newly       developed, processes, materials and products from fibers of polymeric and       agricultural origin            Assessment of the environmental       compatibility of selected and newly developed processes, materials and       products.            Soil burial of newly developed textiles to assess       the effects of various soil characteristics on their biodegration will be       completed. Textiles produced from kenaf, sugarcane, recycled plastics, and       plastics containing soybean fatty acid fillers will be buried in four soil       types for a total of 128 weeks. Physical properties will be measured at       predetermined intervals to monitor their degradation. Nonwoven, woven and       knit fabrics of PET and PP exposed to the novel atmospheric plasma reactor       will also be evaluated for biodegradability in soil burial studies (AR,       KS, LA, MS, TN, GA, WI and AR). In addition, three plain woven fabrics       containing 100% organic cotton, 100% high-impact (conventionally grown),       and 100% Tencel® will be buried in two different soils of different pH       levels for 32 and 64 weeks. Because materials which are almost 100%       cellulose will decay when buried in soil, these three fabrics will be       buried along with a fourth synthetic fabric which will serve as a       statistical check. Changes in physical properties of tensile strength,       tear resistance and flex abrasion, will be measured before and after       burials. Soil analyses will be performed at these same test periods.            AR will assume leadership responsibilities for       soil burial studies, as they have had excellent success with soil burial       protocols. Textile materials made by KS, MS, TN, and LA will be used in       soil burial tests. MS will take the responsibility for soil sample       analyses for all states. Results and data will be shared with cooperating       states, so data can be jointly analyzed and published.                         Modeling the effect of absolute humidity       on durable press fabrics (release of formaldehyde) and other products.            Two different fabrics, 100% cotton print cloth       and 100% cotton twill will be finished with two current durable press       reactants: dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) and urea formaldehyde       (UF). A finish being developed at Auburn University (AL) will also be       applied. The finished fabrics will be exposed at various temperatures and       humidities. Air flowing past the samples will be collected in water, and       analyzed colorimetrically for formaldehyde using chromotropic acid.        Formaldehyde release will be determined for each fabric at each condition.            Moisture regain characteristics of cotton and       rayon fabrics sewn to a fine net structure containing solid desiccants       (i.e., silica gel beads, bacteria generated cellulose) will be measured at       more than two locations (old vs. newer building). For each sample, the       moisture regain will be determined when exposed to constant relative       humidities of 40% and 60% and at a constant temperature (to be       determined). Each sample will be dried in an infrared dryer for about 75       min. to assure essentially zero moisture content at the beginning of each       test. The dry weight will be recorded. The samples will be weighted on an       electronic balance in an environmental chamber that has been preset at the       desired humidity condition, and weighed at four-minute intervals until the       sample reaches saturation. A time series plot of the sample will be       recorded (LA, AL and NC).            LA will coordinate the efforts of LA, AL and NC       for this part of the research and assume leadership responsibilities.                   Objective       3. To evaluate the functional performance, consumer acceptance and       potential commercialization of the textile materials for human health and       safety and/or value-added products            Resistance to pesticides .            Innovative textile structures produced in this       project will be used. Since alachlor, atrazine, and methyl parathion are       widely used pesticides, they will be selected for this project.       Concentrations will be prepared for each insecticide and herbicide using       technical grade pesticides. The solution will be spiked to fabric samples       with equal amounts of 14C label Pesticides, Sorption coefficients of the       pesticides will be determined by fitting the data to the Fruendlich        equation by nonlinear regression method using the SigmaPlot graphics       package. The Sorption coefficients of the selected pesticide chemicals       will be related to textile substrate characteristics of fiber content,       hydrophobicity, swelling capacity, weave, fabric weight and finish using a       descriptive analysis method. (NC and FL)            The effects of wear abrasion on the barrier       properties of both woven and nonwoven protective apparel fabrics that are       being developed as well as for products currently on the market will be       also investigated. Fabrics will be subjected to moderate abrasion using       standard tests for abrasion and tested for changes in liquid penetration       and other liquid/fabric interactions. Results will be compared to abrasion       caused by subjects wearing the fabrics while working. (FL and NC)            NC and FL will cooperate and NC will coordinate       and assume the leadership responsibilities.            Resistance to synthetic blood, virus and       bacteria.            Newly developed and untreated fabrics will be       evaluated for water resistance and impact penetration using water and       synthetic blood; demand wettability and contact angle will be measured       also for the nonwoven textiles made in this project. (TN, GA and WI)            GA will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities.                                Resistance to solar radiation.            The problem of skin cancer is, of course, of       great interest to people with light colored skins as they get older       previous exposures start to show their results. Most of the parameters       that create sun protection in fabrics are fairly obvious and are rather       easily measured. Opaqueness to visible light, which correlates very well       to opaqueness to UV in fabrics, can be evaluated quickly. These studies       should show the degree to which tighter weaves will give greater       protection than loosely woven or knitted fabric.            A selection of new textile materials developed       and marketed for sun-protective clothing will be evaluated for       sun-protection. A wide selection of textiles that vary by fiber content,       fabric construction, and UV absorbing finishes will be evaluated for their       photo-protective effects and durability to use and care. Appropriate       standardized test procedures developed and published by ASTM and AATCC       will be followed. Durability of the products in use will be assessed by       laboratory tests including breaking strength, tearing strength, and       abrasion resistance. Durability of the photo-protective properties to       laundering will be assessed. The Comparative UV blocking abilities of the       selected textile products will be evaluated by UV-visible       spectrophotometric measurements. Because tighter weaves are known to give       better protection than loosely woven materials, research tests will       emphasize tighter woven fabrics. In addition, physical properties and       resistance to UR. will also be studied for the cellulose produced by four       strains of  Acetobacter.  (NB, AR and NC)            NB will assume the leadership responsibilities       and coordinate the efforts for this part of research.            Thermal       Comfort Studies of Plasma Treated Textiles and Cotton/Microporus Film       Based Nonwovens.            Plasma treated polyester and cotton/polyester       bonded fabric and cotton/microporous film based nonwovens will be tested       for thermal comfort on human subjects. Participants in the study would be       surveyed for potential commercialization of the protective health care       clothing products. (TN, FL and AL)            Wear assessments in a controlled lab setting as       well as using the local medical centers' employees for field-wear       assessments will be performed. In the lab setting, subjects will conduct       an exercise protocol and will be evaluated for changes in heart rate, deep       body temperature, skin temperature, and sweat rate at several intervals       during the test. Results will indicate the comparative potential for       protective garments to induce heat stress. In the field experiment (the        field in this case being the medical facility), subjects will wear the       garments during their normal work routine and will provide subjective       responses related to their comfort during the wear period. User surveys of       hospital personnel to determine components of consumer satisfaction with       currently available medical apparel will also be conducted. (TN, FL, AR       and AL)            FL will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities for thermal comfort studies.            Consumer Acceptance and Market Analysis       of Selected Value-Added Products.            It is also important to gather information from       consumers that show their interest in and willingness to accept consumer       items of kenaf blend and other newer materials/products. Therefore, a       questionnaire (Likert-type scale) used to gather responses will be       designed to help identify concerns or problem areas for consumers. These       findings may be helpful as marketing strategies are developed for       increasing consumer and retailer interest/demand. Findings will also help        identify products with most potential for being commercialized. (MS, AR       and NE)            The acceptance of the newly developed protective       clothing (gloves, aprons, surgical gowns and shoe covers) by health care       professionals through a residency program for family practice physicians       located throughout the state of Arkansas (conditional on fabric meeting       OSHA requirements) will be conducted. A survey of users of current medical       protective clothing fabrics will be conducted to determine usage and       satisfaction. (AR and AL)            An extensive market analysis of the national and       international market potential for sugar cane and kenaf products to impact       the soil erosion control market in the U.S. and abroad will be conducted.       A survey of state transportation departments and federal agencies involved       in highway and other soil erosion sites will be done to determine current       and projected usage of nonwoven and spray-on product. This information       will be used to develop a marketing strategy for sugar cane and kenaf       fiber geotextiles for presentation to sugar cane and kenaf producers and       processors (LA, MS, Southern Louisiana (SLA) and GA)            LA will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities for multi-state surveys which will help       identify products with potential for successful commercialization.            EXPECTED OUTCOMES            The successful production of textile consumer       products from kenaf and sugar cane will enhance the value of these       agricultural crops. Farmers growing kenaf will enjoy added income if there       are superior products that can be marketed. Other benefits will be the       creation of jobs in processing plants and farming, and the use of kenaf in       crop rotation schedules. Similarly, there are numerous nonfood uses of       soybean oils and fatty acids, wheat straw, and modified wheat starch in       textile manufacturing and wet processing that can increase the commercial       importance of these major agricultural commodities while reducing the       consumption of petrochemcials.            Development of sugar cane textiles will enhance       the profitability of cane production and processing by providing a       value-added product from what is currently a waste or by-product. The       support of work at LSU by the American Sugar Cane League has signaled the       interest of the industry in development of such products. The market       analysis to be conducted will greatly facilitate the technology transfer       to industrial processors and hasten the commercialization of these       products.            The nonwoven fabrics of kenaf and/or cotton that       are produced experimentally as part of this project will potentially       expand the market for these agricultural fibers. The collaborative work       proposed herein includes not only the production and characterization of       these fabrics but also extensive studies on biodegradability to examine       the environmental impact. Use of the nonwovens in medical disposable       products has significant environmental benefits for the U.S. In addition       the inclusion of market analysis and consumer acceptance will provide       useful information as this technology is adopted by fabric producers.            The textile auxiliaries being developed at KS and       AL can enhance the properties of current textile products and extend the       uses of agricultural commodities. Softeners and finishes that are       environmentally friendly have both economic and consumer appeal. The       plasma treatment to enhance dyeing and finishing properties is likewise a       significant advance in decreasing the environmental impact of textile       processing.            An important contribution of this project will be       the further development of analytical methodologies for textile       characterization. Methods for determination of barrier properties of       fabrics, measurement of pore size in textile structures, surface analysis,       and determination of formaldehyde release will be developed, used, and       correlated. The new knowledge about pore size, combined with the dyeing       equilibria and kinetics research, will yield critical information for the        development of commercially viable dyeing procedures for kenaf fibers and       fabrics.            Information regarding the ultraviolet radiation       transmission of textiles will be useful in developing more effective sun       protective clothing and in evaluating the influx of UV radiation       protective clothing on the market. Agricultural workers who spend many       hours outdoors will benefit from these developments. A wider range of       sun-protective clothing articles should become available as a result of       this research and increased choices should lead to reduced prices for sun        protective clothing.            In addition to the creation of new value-added       products, this work will contribute to the theoretical body of knowledge       pertaining to the physical and chemical structure of cellulose-based       fibers, polymeric materials and various treatments. It will establish       benchmark information on physical properties, dyeing characteristics,       printing capabilities, and functional end-use performance of various newer       textile products. This information is not currently available and will        make a substantial contribution to the textile literature. In addition to       many publications in research journals, all the findings will be drawn       together in one or many Southern Cooperative Series Bulletins and       Brochures.            ORGANIZATION            A regional technical committee will be organized       upon project approval. Operational procedures to be followed are according       to those outlined on Pages 19-22, and 34-37 of the CSREES  Manual for       Cooperative Regional Research  as revised in October, 1992. The voting       membership of the regional technical committee will include one       representative from each cooperating agricultural experiment station or       institution as appointed by the director and a representative of each       cooperating USDA-ARS research location/unit. The administrative advisor       and the CSREES representative will be considered nonvoting members. All       voting members of the technical committee are considered eligible for       office.            The offices of the regional technical committee       will consist of the chair, the vice-chair, and the secretary. These       officers, along with the administrative advisor and the CSREES       representative, will serve as the executive committee. Officers for the       first year will be elected at the organizational meeting for the technical       committee after the project is approved. After the first year, officers       will be elected annually at the technical committee meeting, and they may        succeed themselves.            The chair, in consultation with the executive       committee, may appoint subcommittees to facilitate the accomplishment of       various research and administrative tasks involving the cooperating       institutional representatives. Such tasks may include, but are not limited       to, research planning and coordination, the development of specific       cooperative research procedures, assimilation and analysis of data from       contributing scientists, and publication of regional or other bulletins        and reports.            The duties of the technical committee are to       coordinate work activities related to the project. The chair, in accord       with the administrative advisor, will notify the technical committee of       the time and place of the meeting and will prepare the agenda and preside       at meetings of the technical committee and executive committee. He or she       is responsible for preparing the annual progress report and coordinating       the preparation of regional reports. The vice-chair assists the chair in       all functions, and the secretary records the minutes and performs other       duties assigned by the technical committee or administrative advisor. The       technical committees will meet annually for the purpose of coordination,       reporting, sharing of procedures and analyses, and conducting project       business.            The executive committee, in consultation with the       technical committee, will make annual assessments of progress to consider       the need for realignment of research effort. In consultation with the       administrative advisor and the CSREES representative, such realignment       will be implemented as appropriate.

Summary:  Mike Cato and Hechmi Hamouda (flC State) are going to attend the 28th Microwave Power Symposium in Montreal Canada July 12-14, 1993. Hechmi will present a paper titled An Analytical Model for the Combined Convective and Radiative (IR) Drying of Fabrics. Following is an abstract from  the paper: The process of moisture removal is analyzed based on a balance of the required and supplied thermal energies during drying. The computations were implemented to investigate the process limitations to achieve efficient fabric dving or preheating. An illustrative example, requiring the removal of 70% of the initial water content from a given fabric, was numerically treated for a specific set of drying conditions.  Hechmi Hamouda and Mike Cato have submitted an abstract to the Microwave and High Frequency 1993 International Conference in Goteborg, Sweden, September 28-30. The title of the abstract is A Precise Model for RF Drying of Yarn Packages. The abstract is given below. A mathematical model of the transport phenomena involved in the radio frequency (RF) drying of yarn packages was developed to describe the simultaneousjlow of heat, liquid, water and air. The model consists of mass and energy balances of the process defined in terms of a set of nonlinear equations; empirical relationships are used to solve these equations. Evaluation and applications of the model was demonstrated through a interactive spreadsheet program. The results of the mathematical model are compared to a set of experimental radio frequency drying tests of yarn packages. These tests were investigated in terms of power, moisture content and dving mechanism.  The computer modeling of polymer properties system consisting of the Biosym software running on a Silicon Graphics workstation has been used to predict properties for several polyesters of interest as binders for xerographic printing of textile substrates. The predictions are being checked by preparing the polyesters and checking properties such as glass transition temperature, melt viscosity and initial shear and tensile moduli. Polyesters are being prepared by interfacial polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride with a number of both single and mixed dials. A number of polymer films have also been prepared by UV initiation of acrylic acid terminated monomers. Polyacrylates, polyesters, and polyurethanes have been prepared and are currently being evaluated. The initial results on the use of an HPLC pumping system with spectroscopic detection for on-line analysis of the dye stream being pumped to a continuous carpet dye range have been completed. Results show that it is possible to dilute the dye stream at least lo-fold with a gradient pumping system with a high degree of precision. A range of dye concentrations from approximately 0.001 g/L to 1 g/L can be analyzed with no dilution of the dye stream and with dilution this range is 0.001 to 1.0 g/L. This is a very conservative estimate of the analytical range. The low volume applicator for continuous dye ranges is functional and initial runs are underway. We are now evaluating the uniformity of wet pick-up and the influence of speed and pressure on the wet pick-up. Based on these experiments, conditions will be selected for uniformity and repeatability studies. Detailed information is also being collected on all existing low volume applicators to look at approaches others have taken to solution of this problem and for comparison with the system we are developing.

A dye is used to impart color to materials of which it becomes an integral part. An aromatic ring structure coupled with a side chain is usually required for resonance and thus to impart color. (Resonance structures that cause displacement or appearance of absorption bands in the visible spectrum of light are responsible for color). Correlation of chemical structure with color has been accomplished in the synthesis of dye using a chromogen-chromophore with auxochrome. Chromogen is the aromatic structure containing benzene, naphthalene, or anthracene rings. A chromophore group is a color giver and is represented by the following radicals, which form a basis for the chemical classification of dyes when coupled with the chromogen: azo (-N=N-); carbonyl (=C=0); carbon (=C=C=); carbon-nitrogen (>C=NH or -CH=N-): nitroso (-NO or N-OH): nitro (-NO 2 or =NO-OH): and sulfur (>C=S, and other carbon-sulfur groups). The chromogen-chromophore structure is often not sufficient to impart solubility and cause adherence of dye to fiber. The auxochrome or bonding affinity groups are amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and sulfonic radicals, or their derivatives. These auxochromes are important in the use classification of dyes. A listing of dyes by use classification comprises the following:       Acetate rayon dyes: developed for cellulose acetate and some synthetic fibers      Acid dyes: used for coloring animal fibers via acidified solution (containing sulfuric acid, acetic acid, sodium sulfate, and surfactants) in combination with amphoteric protein      Azoic dyes: contain the azo group (and formic acid, caustic soda, metallic compounds, and sodium nitrate); especially for application to cotton      Basic dyes: amino derivatives (and acetic acid and softening agents); used mainly for application on paper      Direct dyes: azo dyes, and sodium salts, fixing agents, and metallic (chrome and copper) compounds; used generally on cotton-wool, or cotton-silk combinations      Mordant or chrome dyes: metallic salt or lake formed directly on the fiber by the use of aluminum, chromium, or iron salts that cause precipitation in situ      Lake or pigment dyes: form insoluble compounds with aluminum, barium, or chromium on molybdenum salts; the precipitates are ground to form pigments used in paint and inks      Sulfur or sulfide dyes: contain sulfur or are precipitated from sodium sulfide bath; furnish dull shades with good fastness to light, washing, and acids but susceptible to chlorine and light      Vat dyes: impregnated into fiber under reducing conditions and reoxidized to an insoluble color.     Chemical classification is based on chromogen. For example, nitro dyes have the chromophore -NO2. The Color Index (C.I.), published by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) in cooperation with the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATC), provides a detailed classification of commercial dyes and pigments by generic name and chemical constitution.    Dyes are synthesized in a reactor, filtered,dried, and blended with other additives to produce the final product. The synthesis step involves reactions such as sulfonation, halogenation, amination, diazotization, and coupling, followed by separation processes that may include distillation, precipitation, and crystallization. In general, organic compounds such as naphthalene are reacted with an acid or an alkali along with an intermediate (such as a nitrating or a sulfonating compound) and a solvent to form a dye mixture. The dye is then separated from the mixture and purified. On completion of the manufacture of actual color, finishing operations,including drying, grinding, and standardization, are performed; these are important for maintaining consistent product quality.   Waste Characteristics   The principal air pollutants from dye manufacturing are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen chloride (HCI), and sulfur oxides (SOx).   Liquid effluents resulting from equipment cleaning after batch operation can contain toxic organic residues. Cooling waters are normally recirculated. Wastewater generation rates are of the order of 1-700 liters per kg (1/kg) of product except for vat dyes. The wastewater generation rate for vat dyes can be of the order of 8,000 1/kg of product. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of eactive and azo dyes can be of the order of 25 kg/kg of product and 80 kg/ kg of product, respectively. Values for other dyes are, for example, BOD5, 6 kg/kg; COD, 25 kg/kg; suspending solids, 6 kg/kg; and oil and grease, 30 kg/kg of product.   Major solid wastes of concern include filtration sludges, process and effluent treatment sludges, and container residues. Examples of wastes considered toxic include wastewater treatment sludges, spent acids, and process residues from the manufacture of chrome yellow and orange pigments, molybdate orange pigments, zinc yellow pigments, chrome and chrome oxide green pigments, iron blue pigments, and azo dyes.   Pollution Prevention and Control   Every effort should be made to substitute degradable and less toxic ingredients for highly toxic and persistent ingredients. Recommended pollution prevention measures are to:       Avoid the manufacture of toxic azo dyes and provide alternative dyestuffs to users such as textile manufacturers.      Meter and control the quantities of toxic ingredients to minimize wastage.      Reuse by-products from the process as raw materials or as raw material substitutes in other processes.      Use automated filling to minimize spillage.      Use equipment washdown waters as makeup solutions for subsequent batches.      Return toxic materials packaging to supplier for reuse, where feasible.      Find productive uses for off-specification products to avoid disposal problems.      Use high-pressure hoses for equipment cleaning to reduce the amount of wastewater generated.      Label and store toxic and hazardous materials in secure, bunded areas.     A dye and pigment manufacturing plant should prepare and implement an emergency plan that takes into account neighboring land uses and the potential consequences of an emergency. Measures to avoid the release of harmful substances should be incorporated in the design, operation, maintenance, and management of the plant.   Target Pollution Loads   Implementation of cleaner production processes and pollution prevention measures can yield both economic and environmental benefits.   Specific reduction targets for the different processes have not been determined. In the absence of specific pollution reduction targets, new plants should always achieve better than the industry averages cited in ""Waste Characteristics,"" above .   Treatment Technologies   Air Emissions   Stack gas scrubbing and/or carbon adsorption (for toxic organics) are applicable and effective technologies for minimizing the release of significant pollutants to air. Combustion is used to destroy toxic organics. Combustion devices should be operated at temperatures above 1,100 C (when required for the effective destruction of toxic organics), with a residence time of at least 0.5 second.   Liquid Effluents   Effluent treatment normally includes neutralization, flocculation, coagulation, settling,    carbon adsorption, detoxification of organics by oxidation (using ultraviolet systems or    peroxide solutions), and biological treatment. Exhausted carbon from adsorption processes may be sent for regeneration or combustion. Reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, and other filtration techniques are used to recover and concentrate process intermediates.   Solid Hazardous Wastes   Contaminated solid wastes are generally incinerated, and the flue gases, when acidic, are   scrubbed.   Emissions Guidelines   The guidelines are expressed as concentrations to facilitate monitoring. Dilution of air emissions or effluents to achieve these guidelines is unacceptable.   All of the maximum levels should be achieved for at least 95% of the time that the plant or unit is operating, to be calculated as a proportion of annual operating hours.   Air Emissions   The emissions levels presented in Table I should be achieved.   Table 1.

Ambient Noise   Noise abatement measures should achieve either the levels given below or a maximum increase in background levels of 3 decibels (measured on the A scale) [dB (A)].

Once a record of consistentperformance has been established, sampling for the parameters listed in this document should be   as described below.   Monitoring of air emissions should be done on a continuous basis. Liquid effluents should be    monitored for toxic ingredients at least once every shift. The remaining parameters should be   monitored at least daily.   Monitoring data should be analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the    operating standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken. Records of monitoring results should be kept in an acceptable format. The results should be reported to the responsible authorities and relevant parties, as required   Key Issues   The key production and control practices that will lead to compliance with emissions guidelines can be summarized as follows:       Avoid the manufacture of toxic azo dyes and provide alternative dyestuffs to users such as textile manufacturers.      Replace highly toxic and persistent ingredients with less toxic and degradable ones.      Control loss and wastage of toxic ingredients.      Return packaging for refilling.      Use equipment washdown waters as makeup solutions for subsequent batches.      Minimize wastage by inventory control and find uses for off-specification products.          Source : World Bank"

If spectroscopy     is restricted to the visible spectral range, differences in dye     components may remain undetected. One method of detecting additional     components is to use thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC is     an inexpensive, simple, well-documented technique that can be     used, under certain conditions, to complement the use of visible     spectroscopy in comparisons of fiber colorants. The principle     of the method is that the dye components are separated by their     differential migration caused by a mobile phase flowing through     a porous, adsorptive medium.          2.0.

Back to the top          4.0.          Summary of Guidelines        These guidelines are intended     to advise and assist individuals and laboratories that conduct     forensic fiber examinations and comparisons in their effective     application of TLC to the analysis of fiber evidence.        These guidelines are concerned     with the extraction of dyes from single fibers and from bulk     material, classification of the dye or colorant, application     and development of the extractants on TLC plates using an optimal     elution system, and evaluation and interpretation of the resulting     chromatograms. The protocols and equipment mentioned in this     document are not meant to be totally inclusive or exclusive.        Not all fiber type or dye     class combinations are covered in these guidelines.          Back to the top          5.0.          Significance And Use        5.1. Forensic Analysis     of Fiber Colorants Using TLC      Forensic analysis of fiber colorants using TLC should be considered     for single-fiber comparisons only when it is not possible to     discriminate between the fibers of interest using other techniques,     such as comparison microscopy (brightfield and fluorescence)     and microspectrophotometry in the visible range.        5.2. Extraction Procedures     Carried Out Prior to TLC Analysis      The extraction procedures carried out prior to TLC analysis can     provide useful information about dye classification. TLC can     provide useful qualitative information about dye components.     Similar colors made up of different dye components can be differentiated     using this technique. The application of TLC may serve to discriminate     between fibers, or it may confirm their similarity.        5.3. Situations That Preclude     TLC      TLC is not possible in some circumstances: Short lengths of fibers     or pale colored fibers do not have an adequate concentration     of colorant present to be examined, dye extraction from some     fibers is impossible, or desire to preserve evidence for possible     analysis by another examiner precludes removing the color for     analysis.        5.4. Characterizing Dyes     and Evaluating Eluent Systems      Dye from the known material should first be characterized and     eluent systems evaluated to achieve optimum separation of the     extract. Dye is then extracted from single known and questioned     fibers, using an equivalent amount of material.          5.5. Standard          Dye Mixtures Compensate for TLC's Nonreproducibility      TLC is inherently nonreproducible because of variance in eluents     and temperature conditions. Standard dye mixtures (16) should     therefore be used to check eluent performance.        Examples for the preparation     of standard dye mixtures are given in  Appendix     A .          Back to the top          6.0.          Sample Handling        6.1. Using ASTM 1492-94     Standards      The general handling and tracking of the samples should meet     or exceed the requirements of ASTM 1492-94.        6.2. Pretreatment and     Sample Preparation      Pretreatment (e.g., mounting medium and washing solvent) and     sample preparation must be identical for all known and questioned     fibers being compared on one TLC plate. For removing single fibers     from slide preparations, the following procedure is recommended:        6.2.1. Clean the Coverslip.  Any traces of marker pen ink should     be cleaned from the coverslip using an appropriate solvent (e.g.,     acetone);        6.2.2. Crack the Coverslip.  The coverslip should be cracked     all around the fiber, and an appropriate solvent, which will     dissolve the mountant but not affect the fiber or the colorant,     should be used; and        6.2.3. Remove and Clean     the Fiber.  The     fiber should be removed and washed in the solvent.          Back to the top          7.0. Analysis        The ease of dye extraction     and the particular extractant required will depend on the generic     class of the fiber and the type of dye present. The generic class     of the known and questioned fibers must be determined prior to     TLC analysis.        Dye classes are classified     into broad groups on the basis of their chemical properties or     method of application. The determination of the dye class of     the known fibers can be helpful in establishing the best extractant,     as well as to assist in the subsequent selection of the most     efficient eluent system.        Documented extraction schemes     (see  Appendix B ) can be used to determine     the dye class of fibers of known generic classes and, thus, the     optimum extractant. Dye classification is performed on single     fibers or tufts of fiber removed from the known item. A new fiber     or tuft can be used for each classification stage.          7.1. Dye Extraction          Known and questioned fibers must be extracted at the same time under the          same conditions. Single fibers can be extracted in a short length (about          25 mm) of fine capillary tube (internal diameter of about 1.5 mm) that          is sealed at one end. A fine wire can be useful in pushing the fiber down          the tube. The tube must be appropriately labeled.        About 10 µL of the     appropriate extractant (as recommended in  Appendix     C  and  Appendix D ) should be introduced     into the tube to cover the fiber sample. A fine glass pipette     or syringe can be used for this. The tube should be heat sealed     to avoid evaporation and incubated for a constant time and temperature     (as recommended in Appendix B), preferably in an oven. Periodic     checks for dye extraction should be made every 15 minutes for     up to 1 hour.        7.2. Dye Extraction for     Bulk Material      Larger fiber tufts (e.g., known samples) can be extracted in     a Durham tube or other suitable small stoppered glass tube, using     about 100 µL of solvent in a sand bath or oven heated to     100°C. Periodic checks should be made every 15 minutes for     up to 1 hour.        7.3. Nonextractable Dyes      If classification indicates that a nonextractable dye or pigment     other than a reactive dye is present, then place one known and     one questioned fiber in labeled capillary tubes. Add approximately     10 µL pyridine/water (4:3) and attempt to extract at about     100°C for one hour. If neither fiber extracts, a positive     association is noted. If the questioned extracts and the known     does not (or vice versa), it is negative. If both questioned     and known bleed dye into solution, there can be sufficient dye     for analysis.        7.4. Elution      Aluminum-backed silica gel 60F 254 plates measuring 5 cm ×     7.5 cm are recommended for normal-phase TLC of fiber dyes (16).     Plates should be stored in a desiccator. If this is not possible,     they should be heat activated before use.        Both known and questioned     dyes to be compared must be applied to the same plate. The extract     should be spotted onto the plate about 1 cm from the lower edge.     This can be done using a double-drawn capillary tube or other     suitable device. Spots should not be too near the edge of the     plate or to each other. Care should be taken to avoid scratching     the adsorbent coating layer.        Spots should be dried using     a hair dryer or hot plate, and repeated applications should be     made until the spot is strongly colored. The spot size should     be uniform and not exceed about 2 mm in size.        At least two (preferably     more) known spots should be included on each plate, on both sides     of the questioned sample or samples. It is advisable to include     a standard dye spot. A note must be made of the sample order     on the plate itself. Plates must be thoroughly dried before developing.        7.5. Development Chamber      Chromatograms can be developed vertically in a glass chamber,     which can be as simple as a covered glass beaker. Commercial     tanks are available (16). Twin trough tanks allow the solvent     to be transferred to the plate side without removing the cover,     but extreme care must be taken when doing this.        The eluent should be added     to the tank and allowed to stand in the closed container for     a few minutes before development, which allows the chamber to     be saturated with the solvent vapor. (This will not be complete     if a beaker is used, but equilibration is not critical when sample     size is very small and the elution time is short.)        The level of the eluent in     a vertical tank should be at least 0.5 cm below the origin or     application spots on the TLC plate. The plate should be eluted     until good resolution is achieved (normally 2 cm from the origin)     but not so far as to allow the spots to become diffuse, which     makes visualization difficult. The plate should be removed, and     the position of the solvent front marked. The plate should be     dried in a hot air stream. The eluent should be discarded.        7.5.1. Selecting the     Eluent.  Five     parameters must be considered when selecting the optimum eluent:      7.5.1.1. Separation of component dyes;      7.5.1.2. Sharpness of bands;      7.5.1.3. Movement from the origin;      7.5.1.4. Components traveling at or close to solvent front; and      7.5.1.5. Strength of dye extract from questioned fibers.        There are numerous published     TLC solvent systems that can be applied to the development of     particular fiber and dye class combinations (see Appendixes C     and D).        Two or more systems should     be assessed with the known fibers to determine the optimum eluent     system that can be used for comparison with the questioned fibers.        Equivalent lengths of fiber     should be used for pale fibers or short sample lengths. The extract     from known material should be applied to the TLC plate and developed     in the trial eluents as previously described.        If the eluents produce poor     separation, other eluents appropriate to the dye class are evaluated.     In exceptional circumstances, eluents appropriate to other dye     classes can be used.        After a suitable eluent system     has been found, comparison of known and questioned fibers can     be carried out. Co-chromatography can be carried out for bulk     samples.        After drying, plates should     be examined immediately in visible and in longwave ultraviolet     light. Band positions and colors should be noted.        The color and fluorescence     of the spots and the distance from the center of each spot to     the origin can be measured and recorded. The method of documentation     is a matter of individual laboratory preference.        Plates and samples must be     identifiable. Plates must be either documented by photography     or retained and stored out of direct sunlight in a manner designed     to minimize fading or both.          Back to the top          8.0.          Report Documentation        Chromatograms of dyes from     the same fibers run in different eluent systems or on different     plate types are considered mutually exclusive. The spot colors,     fluorescence, sequence, and position of the spots obtained from     the dye of the questioned fibers are compared to those from the     corresponding known fibers.        A positive association occurs     when the band colors, fluorescence, sequence, and positions are     consistent between questioned and known fibers. A negative (exclusion)     association is noted when either the questioned or known patterns     show no similarities, or where there are a number of coincident     bands, but one or more bands are missing from the questioned     or known. An inconclusive association is noted when there are     no bands on the TLC plate because insufficient colorant is present     in the extract. In cases where the amount of extract is very     small, the distance traveled by the eluent is very small, and     in some cases the spots may not be well-defined. In these circumstances,     attempts to calculate the Retardation Factor (RF) values can     easily be inaccurate and therefore meaningless.        The TLC methods applied to     the forensic comparison of fiber colorants must have been published     in a recognized forensic journal, forensically relevant textbook,     or in an accredited forensic laboratory manual.        Plates must be identifiable     with respect to case number, sample source, examiner, and date.     Case documentation on TLC must include the source of the samples;     method of dye classification; details of extractants or eluent     systems tested, used, or both; and the results. The use of standard     dye mixtures as system performance checks is strongly recommended.          Back to the top          9.0. References        (1) Fried, B. and Sherma,     J.

In the meantime, we have synthesized an analog of these dyes that possesses improved water solubility, and will be evaluating its fastness properties soon. In recent weeks, we elected to turn our attention to a family of less commonly used complex-forming monoazo dyes as targets for the synthesis of new I:2 Iron complexes. The result has been the formation of blue and violet colors for nylon and wool, in addition to brown and black shades. Needless to say, this is an exciting and quite promising turn of events. We are planning to synthesize a group of mixed complexes, with the goal of fine tuning some of the present shades. Obviously, the next step is to assess the fastness properties of this new family of dyes. The results of this determination will be outlined in our next report. Preliminary results from the mutagenicity testing of the metallized dyes prepared so far indicate that the Fe complexes are either non-mutagenic or significantly less mutagenic than both the corresponding Co and Cr analogs and the unmetallized precursors. Laura will have more definitive results for the next report.

Summary:  We completed our investigation of the utility of FeCl, as a coagulant for the removal of phosphate ions from disperse dye wastewater. Using filtrates derived from the synthesis of Disperse Red 177, we found that phosphate removal at a level of 99.999+% can be achieved when an Fe:P ratio of 2: 1 is used. This means that either Alum or FeCl, can be used as long as the proper pH is employed. For Alum the pH should be 5-6, and for the pH should be 3-4. In the coming months we will conclude the present aspect of our work in this area with a determination of the utility of the collected phosphate as a component for commercial fertilizers. This is envisioned as an alternative to either incineration or landfilling the coagulants. Technical Papers and Other Communications  A manuscript entitled ""Premetallized Acid Dyes Based on Environmental Considerations"" has been prepared for the Book of Papers for the upcoming AATCC International Conference (October, 1993). This paper outlines the results to be presented during the conference delivery, and focuses on the fastness properties and genotoxicity of the black Fe complexes synthesized as potential non-chromium alternatives to commercial premetallized acid black dyes containing Cr. The manuscript mentioned in our last report as having been submitted to Textile Research Journal has been reviewed, and was found acceptable pending our consideration of 3 points. These were handled by us immediately, and the editor has sent the revised manuscript to the reviewer for final consideration.  Joint research involving all three universities is being done to determine the effects of washing efficiency on dielectric properties and RF drying of yarn packages. Warren Perkins has determined common residuals in bleached and dyed yarn packages. With Warren's recommendations, experiments are being designed and conducted at Georgia Tech using a network analyzer which measures the dielectric properties of materials. Different solutions typically found in textile dyeing have been prepared and analyzed to determine their dielectric properties. Different types of salt had significantly different loss factors. Data is being analyzed and a final report will be compiled within two months. NC State is planning to use the information learned at Georgia Tech to design pilot plant drying studies. To better understand the network analyzer, Mike Cato, from NC State, worked at Georgia Tech for a day.  National Textib Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993  23   the tests.

Summary:  Mike Cato and Hechmi Hamouda (flC State) are going to attend the 28th Microwave Power Symposium in Montreal Canada July 12-14, 1993. Hechmi will present a paper titled An Analytical Model for the Combined Convective and Radiative (IR) Drying of Fabrics. Following is an abstract from  the paper: The process of moisture removal is analyzed based on a balance of the required and supplied thermal energies during drying. The computations were implemented to investigate the process limitations to achieve efficient fabric dving or preheating. An illustrative example, requiring the removal of 70% of the initial water content from a given fabric, was numerically treated for a specific set of drying conditions.  Hechmi Hamouda and Mike Cato have submitted an abstract to the Microwave and High Frequency 1993 International Conference in Goteborg, Sweden, September 28-30. The title of the abstract is A Precise Model for RF Drying of Yarn Packages. The abstract is given below. A mathematical model of the transport phenomena involved in the radio frequency (RF) drying of yarn packages was developed to describe the simultaneousjlow of heat, liquid, water and air. The model consists of mass and energy balances of the process defined in terms of a set of nonlinear equations; empirical relationships are used to solve these equations. Evaluation and applications of the model was demonstrated through a interactive spreadsheet program. The results of the mathematical model are compared to a set of experimental radio frequency drying tests of yarn packages. These tests were investigated in terms of power, moisture content and dving mechanism.  The computer modeling of polymer properties system consisting of the Biosym software running on a Silicon Graphics workstation has been used to predict properties for several polyesters of interest as binders for xerographic printing of textile substrates. The predictions are being checked by preparing the polyesters and checking properties such as glass transition temperature, melt viscosity and initial shear and tensile moduli. Polyesters are being prepared by interfacial polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride with a number of both single and mixed dials. A number of polymer films have also been prepared by UV initiation of acrylic acid terminated monomers. Polyacrylates, polyesters, and polyurethanes have been prepared and are currently being evaluated. The initial results on the use of an HPLC pumping system with spectroscopic detection for on-line analysis of the dye stream being pumped to a continuous carpet dye range have been completed. Results show that it is possible to dilute the dye stream at least lo-fold with a gradient pumping system with a high degree of precision. A range of dye concentrations from approximately 0.001 g/L to 1 g/L can be analyzed with no dilution of the dye stream and with dilution this range is 0.001 to 1.0 g/L. This is a very conservative estimate of the analytical range. The low volume applicator for continuous dye ranges is functional and initial runs are underway. We are now evaluating the uniformity of wet pick-up and the influence of speed and pressure on the wet pick-up. Based on these experiments, conditions will be selected for uniformity and repeatability studies. Detailed information is also being collected on all existing low volume applicators to look at approaches others have taken to solution of this problem and for comparison with the system we are developing. A trip is planned next quarter to visit the Research Center in Valence, France. is one of the leading companies in printing technology and we are interested in one of the Imaje units as a test bed for our materials development effort.

GX002-59-4119626	"Nuclear Energy   (An Overview)    Also See Our Nuclear Issues Web Page     Nuclear energy in California produced  40,417 million kilowatt/hours (GWh) of electricity in 1999, or 14.66 percent of electricity from all sources.  The total dependable capacity of California's nuclear-supplied power is more than 5,300 megawatts, including the two operating   nuclear power facilities in California  and portions of nuclear facilities in other states owned by California electricity companies.   There are two fundamental ways to release energy from nuclear reactions:  fission  and   fusion  of atomic nuclei. Electricity generating technologies based on fission are commercially available, whereas fusion is still in the early stages of research and development and is at present only a theoretical possibility for controlled power generation.  Nuclear fission is the process of splitting the nuclei of atoms, which releases energy from within those atoms.  Nuclear fusion is the process of joining, rather than splitting, such atomic particles with similar releases of energy.         FISSION   Of the several types of fission reactors, the most common type in the United States is light water reactors (so called because normal (light) water is used to cool the reactor core; some reactors use heavy water, which contains hydrogen atoms with an additional neutron in the nucleus), based on pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) technology.  PWRs and BWRs use uranium-235, a naturally-occurring radioactive isotope of uranium, as the fuel.  As the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom is hit by a neutron, it splits into two smaller atoms of other elements, and releases energy and extra neutrons.  Those neutrons hit more atoms of the original uranium-235, creating a fission chain reaction that releases more energy and neutrons.   In a PWR, water passes through the nuclear core and is heated. The power plant's primary circulating system passes water through the reactor core, where the water is heated by the nuclear reaction.  That water (under high temperature and pressure to prevent boiling) is passed through a steam generator, where it releases its heat to the secondary circulating system.  Water in the secondary circulating system is allowed to boil, and the resulting steam is used to drive a steam turbine-generator.   In a BWR, there is no need for a steam generator and a secondary circulating system, as the water in the primary circulating system is allowed to boil before exiting the reactor and is then routed directly to a steam turbine-generator.         Safety Issues   In light of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., many have raised concerns about the safety of nuclear facilities in the event of an attack by crashing a commercial jet liner.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been asked what would happen if a fully fueled airliner crashed into a nuclear power plant.  NRC officials said, ""Although nuclear power plants are not explicitly designed for the crash of a commercial aircraft, plants have inherent capability to provide for the protection of public health and safety. Pre-stressed concrete containment buildings are robust, and it is unlikely a large commercial plane could penetrate the containment structure. Furthermore, plant designs and redundant safety equipment along with highly trained operators are in place to limit the potential consequences.""   Pacific Gas and Electric Company was asked the same question, and they reportedly said that their Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant is designed to withstand the impact of a fully loaded ""747"" aircraft.

Other Types of Fission Plants    There are several advanced reactor power plant designs being developed in the U.S. and over-seas.  These include both advanced light water reactor (ALWR) and advanced modular reactor designs.  The ALWR program is focusing on both evolutionary and passive designs, using both BWR and PWR technologies.  Each design configuration is seeking certification by the U.S. NRC as a standard design under the U.S. Department of Energy's ALWR Design Certification Program.    The evolutionary ALWRs are advancements of today's light water reactor designs and use conventional safety system concepts.  There are two evolutionary ALWR designs that are expected to be ready for commercial operation by the year 2000: the 1,356 MW Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and the 1,350 MW Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (System 80+).  Two ABWR units are being built in Japan.   As of July 1996, the first unit is ready to begin commercial operation.  The second unit is scheduled to begin operation in 1997.  In June 1996, Taiwan ordered two ABWR units.  The System 80+ PWR received its final design approval from the NRC in July 1994.   The passive ALWR designs are greatly simplified and employ primarily passive means for accident prevention and mitigation. There are two passive ALWR designs that have been considered: 600 MW Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (AP600) and the 600 MW Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR).  The AP600 Advanced PWR is expected to receive its final design approval from the NRC in September 1996.  It could be ready for commercial operation by the year 2003.  The future of the SBWR is uncertain at this time.   The Advanced Modular Reactor Program is focusing on the development of small (165 MW to 217 MW) reactors that can be grouped together as modules of a larger power station.  The two advanced modular reactor designs, which are also seeking design certification, are the 1,500 MW Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor (ALMR) and the 700 MW Modular High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (MHTGR).  These designs are expected to be ready for commercial operation by the year 2010.      Issues for Fission Power Plants   Some of the issues associated with commercial nuclear power plants include:      Nuclear plants may not be economically feasible in the United States. No American utility has proposed to construct a new nuclear power plant since the late 1970s.    Need for a spent fuel disposal facility and a decommissioning plan    Use of large amounts of water for cooling purposes (if wet cooling towers are used)    Biological impacts on the ocean due to thermal discharge (if seawater cooling is used)    Designing for seismic safety    Public safety concerns    Transportation issues associated with the development of an emergency evacuation plan    Changes in visual quality due to the power plant structures, including the reactor vessel containment structure, and cooling towers (if applicable)    Potentially significant amounts of land    Potentially significant public opposition           FUSION   A fusion reaction occurs when nuclei of light elements, specifically hydrogen and its isotopes (deuterium, or ""heavy water,"" and tritium), are forced together at extremely high temperatures and densities until they fuse into nuclei of heavier elements and release enormous amounts of energy.  If fusion is to yield net energy, the fuel must be heated in the form of plasma (a highly ionized gas) to a very high temperature and the plasma must then be held together for a sufficiently long time such that the number of fusion reactions occurring releases more energy than was required to heat the fuel.     The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory's Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) in 1996 demonstrated fusion of deuterium-tritium plasma at 510 million degrees Celsius.  That experiment produced heating equal to one-third of that needed for the fusion reaction to become self-sustaining.  Thus, there is still significant research that must be accomplished before fusion achieves a net energy output, and then even more development work to develop commercial power plant applications.  It is estimated that commercial availability of fusion is at least 20 years away.    To generate commercial energy, the neutron energy would be converted to heat in a surrounding blanket of coolant, probably containing solid lithium compounds, with the heat converted to electricity in a conventional steam generator cycle.  Although the fusion reaction does not produce radioactive fission products, the high energy neutrons do irradiate the surrounding reactor vessel and associated components.  The irradiated material poses radioactive disposal problems similar to those for the irradiated reactor vessels of fission reactors.  Thus, many of the high-level nuclear waste concerns that apply to fission reactors would also apply to fusion reactors.   The term ""cold fusion,"" as reported in the popular press in recent years, refers to the process of fusing hydrogen nuclei at room temperature.  It was allegedly demonstrated in a simple laboratory apparatus in 1989 by Fleischman and Pons.  Several experiments have been conducted to try to replicate their work, with limited success.  The phenomenon of cold fusion cannot be reproduced on demand and cannot be explained by conventional nuclear physics.  Therefore, its commercial potential as an electric generating technology is uncertain.   An excellent article on cold fusion recently appeared in  Issue 6.11 of  Wired Magazine .

According to President Clinton, the Green Chemistry Challenge was established to ""promote pollution prevention and industrial ecology through a new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Design for the Environment partnership with the chemical industry."" More specifically, the program was established to recognize and support fundamental and innovative chemical methodologies that are useful to industry and that accomplish pollution prevention through source reduction. EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program on October 30, 1995. She described the program as an opportunity for individuals, groups, and organizations ""to compete for Presidential awards in recognition of fundamental breakthroughs in cleaner, cheaper, smarter chemistry."" The Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program provides national recognition for technologies that incorporate green chemistry principles into chemical design, manufacture, and use. Entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards were judged by an independent panel of technical experts convened by the American Chemical Society. The criteria for judging included health and environmental benefits, scientific innovation, and industrial applicability. Five projects that best met the scope of the program and the criteria for judging were selected for 1997 awards and nationally recognized on June 24, 1997. This document provides summaries of the entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. The approaches described in these summaries illustrate how numerous individuals, groups, and organizations from academia, small businesses, industry, and government are demonstrating a commitment to designing, developing, and implementing green chemical methodologies that are less hazardous to human health and the environment. The approaches described in these summaries also illustrate the technical and economic feasibility of implementing green chemical methodologies and are recognized for their beneficial scientific, economic, and environmental impacts.  Note: The summaries provided in this document were obtained from the entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. They were edited for space, stylistic consistency, and clarity, but they were not written by nor are officially endorsed by EPA. In many cases, these summaries represent only a fraction of the information provided in the entries received and, as such, are intended to highlight the nominated projects, not describe them fully.

Commercialized since 1992 in BHC's 3,500 metric-ton-per-year facility in Bishop, Texas, the new process was cited as an industry model of environmental excellence in chemical processing technology. For its innovation, BHC was the recipient of the Kirkpatrick Achievement Award for ""outstanding advances in chemical engineering technology"" in 1993. The new technology involves only three catalytic steps, with approximately 80 percent atom utilization (virtually 99 percent including the recovered byproduct acetic acid) and replaces technology with 6 stoichiometric steps and less than 40 percent atom utilization. The use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as both a catalyst and solvent offers important advantages in reaction selectivity and waste reduction. As such, this chemistry is a model of source reduction, the method of waste minimization that tops EPA's waste management hierarchy. Virtually all starting materials are either converted to product or reclaimed byproduct, or are completely recovered and recycled in the process. The generation of waste is practically eliminated. The BHC ibuprofen process is an innovative, efficient technology that revolutionized bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing. The process provides an elegant solution to a prevalent problem encountered in bulk pharmaceutical synthesis (i.e., how to avoid the large quantities of solvents and wastes associated with the traditional stoichiometric use of auxiliary chemicals when effecting chemical conversions). Large volumes of aqueous wastes (salts) normally associated with such manufacturing are virtually eliminated. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride catalyst/solvent is recovered and recycled with greater than 99.9 percent efficiency. No other solvent is needed in the process, simplifying product recovery and minimizing fugitive emissions. The nearly complete atom utilization of this streamlined process truly makes it a waste-minimizing, environmentally friendly technology.  2   Alternative Solvents/Reaction Conditions Award DryViewTM Imaging Systems Photothermography is an imaging technology whereby a latent image, created by exposing a sensitized emulsion to appropriate light energy, is processed by the application of thermal energy. Photothermographic films are easily imaged by laser diode imaging systems, with the resultant exposed film processed by passing it over a heat roll. A heat roll operating at 250 F in contact with the film will produce diagnostic-quality images in approximately 15 seconds. Based on photothermography technology, Imation's DryViewTM Imaging Systems use no wet chemistry, create no effluent, and require no additional postprocess steps such as drying. In contrast, silver halide photographic films are processed by bathing them in a chemical developer, soaking them in a fix solution, washing them with clean water, and finally drying them. The developer and fix solutions contain toxic chemicals such as hydroquinone, silver, and acetic acid. In the wash cycle, this chemistry, along with silver compounds, is flushed from the film and becomes part of the waste stream. The resulting effluent amounts to billions of gallons of liquid waste each year. Significant developments in photothermographic image quality have been achieved that allow it to successfully compete with silver halide technology. During 1996, Imation placed more than 1,500 DryViewTM medical laser imagers, which represent 6 percent of the world's installed base. These units alone have eliminated the annual disposal of 192,000 gallons of developer, 330,000 gallons of fixer, and 54.5 million gallons of contaminated water into the waste stream. As future systems are placed, the reductions will be even more dramatic. DryViewTM technology is applicable to all industries that process panchromatic film products. The largest of these industries are medical radiography, printing, industrial radiography, and military reconnaissance. DryViewTM is valued by these industries because it supports pollution prevention through source reduction.  Imation  3   Designing Safer Chemicals Award Albright & Wilson Americas  THPS Biocides: A New Class of Antimicrobial Chemistry Conventional biocides, used to control the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi in industrial cooling systems, oil fields, and process applications, are highly toxic to humans and aquatic life and often persist in the environment, leading to long-term damage. To address this problem, a new and relatively benign biocide, tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium sulfate (THPS), has been discovered by Albright & Wilson Americas. THPS biocides represent a completely new class of antimicrobial chemistry that combines superior antimicrobial activity with a relatively benign toxicology profile. THPS's benefits include low toxicity, low recommended treatment level, rapid breakdown in the environment, and no bioaccumulation. When substituted for more toxic biocides, THPS biocides provide reduced risks to both human health and the environment. THPS is so effective as a biocide that, in most cases, the recommended treatment level is below that which would be toxic to fish. In addition, THPS rapidly breaks down in the environment through hydrolysis, oxidation, photodegradation, and biodegradation. In many cases, it substantially breaks down before the treated water enters the environment. The degradation products have been shown to possess a relatively benign toxicology profile. Furthermore, THPS does not bioaccumulate and, therefore, offers a much reduced risk to higher life forms. THPS biocides are aqueous solutions and do not contain volatile organic compounds. Because THPS is halogen-free, it does not contribute to dioxin or AOX formation. Because of its low overall toxicity and easier handling when compared to alternative products, THPS provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of health and safety incidents. THPS has been applied to a range of industrial water systems for the successful control of microorganisms. The U.S. industrial water treatment market for nonoxidizing biocides alone is 42 million pounds per year and growing at 6 to 8 percent annually. There are over 500,000 individual use sites in this industry category. Because of its excellent environmental profile, THPS has already been approved for use in environmentally sensitive areas around the world and is being used as a replacement for the higher risk alternatives.  4   Small Business Award ColdstripTM, A Revolutionary Organic Removal and Wet Cleaning Technolog y For over 30 years, the removal of photoresists with Piranha solutions (sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, or ashers) has been the standard in the semiconductor, flat panel display, and micromachining industries. Use of Piranha solutions has been associated with atmospheric, ground, and water pollution. Legacy Systems, Inc. (LSI) has developed a revolutionary wet processing technology, ColdstripTM, that removes photoresist and organic contaminants for the semiconductor, flat panel display, and micromachining industries. ColdstripTM uses only water and oxygen as raw materials. LSI's ColdstripTM process is a chilled ozone process that uses only oxygen and water as the raw materials. The active product is ozone, that safely decomposes to oxygen in the presence of photoresist. Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and water are formed. There are no high temperatures, no sulfuric acid, no hydrogen peroxide, and no nitric acid, all of which cause environmental issues. The equipment required for the chilled ozone process consists of a gas diffuser, an ozone generator, a recirculating pump, a water chiller, and a process vessel. The water solution remains clear and colorless throughout the entire process sequence. There are no particles or resist flakes shed from the wafer into the water; therefore, there are no requirements for particle filtration. Using oxygen and water as raw materials replacing the Piranha solutions significantly benefits the environment. One benefit is the elimination of over 8,400 gallons of Piranha solutions used per year per silicon wet station and over 25,200 gallons used per year per flat panel display station. Additionally, the overall water consumption is reduced by over 3,355,800 gallons per year per silicon wafer wet station and over 5,033,700 gallons per year per flat panel display station. The corresponding water consumption in LSI's process is 4,200 gallons per year and there is no Piranha use. In 1995, the U.S. Patent Office granted LSI patent 5,464,480 covering this technology. The system has the lowest environmental impact of any wet resist strip process, eliminating the need for thousands of gallons of Piranha chemicals and millions of gallons of water a year.  Legacy Systems, Inc.  5   Academic Award Professor Joseph M. DeSimone, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University  Design and Application of Surfactants for Carbon Dioxide One dilemma of modern industrial technology is that the environment's worst contaminants themselves have a technologies for the design and application of surfactants oped at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill dilemma. the solvents required to dissolve contaminating effect. Now, new for carbon dioxide (CO2), devel(UNC), promise to resolve this  Over 30 billion pounds of organic and halogenated solvents are used worldwide each year as solvents, processing aids, cleaning agents, and dispersants. Solvent-intensive industries are considering alternatives that can reduce or eliminate the negative impact that solvent emissions can have in the workplace and in the environment. CO2, in a solution state, has long been recognized as an ideal solvent, extractant, and separation aid. CO2 solutions are nontoxic, nonflammable, safe to work with, energy-efficient, cost-effective, waste-minimizing, and reusable. Historically, the prime factor inhibiting the use of this solvent replacement has been the low solubility of most materials in CO2, both in its liquid and supercritical (sc) states. With the discovery of CO2 surfactant systems, Professor DeSimone and his students have dramatically advanced the solubility performance characteristics of CO2 systems for several industries. The design of broadly applicable surfactants for CO2 relies on the identification of `CO2-philic' materials from which to build amphiphiles. Although CO2 in both its liquid and supercritical states dissolves many small molecules readily, it is a very poor solvent at easily accessible conditions (e.g., T less than 100 C and P less than 300 bar) for many substances. As an offshoot of Professor DeSimone's research program on polymer synthesis in CO2, he and his researchers exploited the high solubility of a select few CO2-philic polymeric segments to develop nonionic surfactants capable of dispersing high solids polymer latexes in both liquid and sc CO2 phases. The design criteria they developed for surfactants, which were capable of stabilizing heterogeneous polymerizations in CO2, have been expanded to include CO2-insoluble compounds in general. This development lays the foundation by which surfactant-modified CO2 can be used to replace conventional (halogenated) organic solvent systems currently used in manufacturing and service industries such as precision cleaning, medical device fabrication, and garment care as well as in the chemical manufacturing and coating industries.  6   Entries From Academia Biocatalysis/The Use of Genetically Manipulated Microbes as Synthetic Catalysts Fundamentally changing chemical syntheses, as opposed to incremental changes in currently practiced syntheses, is one strategy for ensuring that environmental improvement does not occur at the expense of global, economic competitiveness. Examples of this design principle are found in the syntheses of adipic acid and catechol created by John W. Frost and Karen M. Draths as well as in this research team's elaboration of the antioxidant activity of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). In excess of 1.9 x 109 kg of adipic acid is annually produced and used in the manufacture of nylon 66. Most commercial syntheses of adipic acid use benzene as the starting material. Approximately 2.1 x 107 kg of catechol is globally produced each year. Catechol is an important chemical building block used to synthesize flavors, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymerization inhibitors and antioxidants. Although some catechol is distilled from coal tar, petroleum-derived benzene is the starting material for most catechol production. The Frost-Draths syntheses of adipic acid and catechol rely on the use of genetically manipulated microbes as synthetic catalysts. Nontoxic glucose is employed as a starting material that, in turn, is derived from renewable feedstocks such as plant starch. In addition, water is used as the primary reaction solvent, and generation of toxic intermediates and environment-damaging byproducts is avoided. Professor W. John Frost, Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University Professor Karen M. Draths, Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University  Biomimetic Transition Metal Complexes for Homogeneous Catalytic Reductive Dechlorination of the PCBs/One-Step Extraction-Detoxification in Subcritical and Supercritical Fluids Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous in the global environment, toxic, and generally nonbiodegradable. A family of homogeneous catalysts has been developed at the University of Georgia for the conversion of PCBs to dechlorinated congeners and nontoxic biphenyl by a hydrogenolysis process known as reductive dechlorination (RD). This unique green chemistry has been demonstrated to occur at room temperature due to the high reactivity of the homogeneous transition metal catalysts used for activation of the carbon chlorine bond. The organophosphorus transition metal complexes used for catalysis also are extractable in subcritical solvents used for PCB extraction from soils, sediments, and animal and human tissue matrices. Hence, coextraction of PCBs and the transition metal catalyst has been demonstrated, leading to dechlorination and detoxification of the PCB mixture in one step. This process is compatible with chemical engineering unit operations for countercurrent continuous liquid extraction, as practiced in the chemical industry.  Dr. Charles M. King, Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia Dr. R. Bruce King, Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia  7   Professor Richard A. Gross, Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts-- Lowell Dr. David L. Kaplan, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tufts University  Biotechnological Routes to ` Tailored' Polymeric Products of Environmental and Industrial Importance Microbial polymerizations offer the potential for the discovery of important new routes to polymers and materials from renewable resources that involve all aqueous, green chemical routes. A critical problem limiting the utility of such methods is the inability to control product structural variables that ultimately determine functional properties. The work of Richard A. Gross has led to the development of a family of technologies that demonstrated unprecedented levels of control for nonribosomal mediated microbial polymerizations. Lipoheteropolysaccharides have been prepared from renewable resources, and innovative methods were developed to control the product's fatty acid structure and the degree of substitution. This has led to a diverse family of new biodegradable bioemulsifiers that have wide applicability for the stabilization of oil/water emulsions in cleaning and degreasing formulations, biocosmetics, green coating technologies, and bioremediation of organic pollutants. A second technology area has used polyethylene glycols to regulate microbial polyester molecular weight, repeat unit composition, and alter repeat unit sequence distribution. Furthermore, this strategy can be used to form microbial polyester-polyethylene glycol diblock copolymers. It is now possible, therefore, to consider the in-vivo preparation of synthetic-natural diblocks. This technology created a number of opportunities for the preparation of completely biodegradable interfacial agents for blends, the termination of chains with reactive end-groups for coupling pharmacologically active molecules, and the engineering of surfactant molecules. A third technology area has been the development of new fermentation routes to anionic -poly(glutamic acid) from renewable resources such as glucose. These routes have the potential to replace millions of pounds of anionic polymers, such as polyacrylic acid, which is nonbiodegradable and persistent in nature.  Professor Alan T. Hatton, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Stephen L. Buchwald, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Linda K. Molnar, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Derivatized and Polymeric Solvents for Minimizing Pollution During the Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals A new class of solvents has been developed that has solvation properties similar to those of solvents used conventionally in chemical synthesis, separations, and cleaning operations, but for which the potential for loss by environmentally unfavorable air emissions or aqueous discharge streams is minimized. These alternative solvents are derivatives of solvents currently used in reaction and separation processes, tailored so that they are relatively nonvolatile and nonwater soluble, thereby satisfying the criteria for pollution source reduction. The solvents can be used as neat reaction or separation media, or they can be diluted in an inert environment such as in higher alkanes. Polymeric or oligomeric solvents have been synthesized using macromonomers incorporating the desired solvent functionality. These polymeric solvents are easily recovered using mechanical separations such as ultrafiltration rather than energy-intensive distillation processes. This new concept for the design and synthesis of solvents offers the potential for significant source reductions in air and water pollution and can be considered to be widely applicable to fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis, separations, and cleaning operations. It is expected to reduce the complexity of downstream processing options considerably and lead to energy efficient reaction/separation sequences.  8   Environmental Advantages Offered by Indium-Promoted Carbon-Carbon Bond-Forming Reactions in Water In view of increasing demands to reduce emissions during the production of chemical and pharmaceutical end-products, it is imperative to consider the development of effective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in aqueous media. The work of Dr. Paquette demonstrates not only that the counter-intuitive notion of organometallic carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions performed in water is indeed workable but also that high levels of stereocontrol are attainable. The key to this safe, environmentally friendly technology is the utilization of metallic indium as the promoter. The metal indium, a relatively unexplored element, has recently been shown to offer intriguing advantages for promoting organic transformations in aqueous solution. The feasibility of performing organometallic/carbonyl condensations in water, for example, has been amply demonstrated for the metal indium. Indium is nontoxic, very resistant to air oxidation, and easily recovered by simple electrochemical means, thus permitting its reuse and guaranteeing uncontaminated waste flow. The power of the synthetic method, which often can exceed performance levels observed in purely organic solvents, includes no need for protecting groups, greatly enhanced ease of operation, and greatly reduced pollution risks.  Dr. Leo A. Paquette, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University  Environmentally Benign Approach to Chemical Processing Using Microwave Irradiation Under SolventFree Conditions An environmentally benign approach was developed by Rajender S. Varma that utilizes microwave activation of neat reactants either in the presence of a catalyst or catalyzed by the surfaces of recyclable support(s) such as alumina, silica, clay, and `doped' surfaces, namely, NaIO4-silica, iron(III)nitrate-clay (clayfen) and Envirocats reagents under solvent-free `dry' conditions, thus promoting `at source' reduction of solvents and excess chemicals in manufacture. This pollution prevention strategy has been targeted to industrially significant cleavage, condensation, oxidation, and cyclisation reactions that currently employ toxic, corrosive, and irritant chemicals, and generate hazardous waste. This technology uses material science, molecular modeling and synthetic organic chemistry expertise, and addresses the needs of the broad chemical community (e.g., polymer, pharmaceutical, and fine chemical) by efficient production of valuable intermediates (e.g., enones, imines, enamines, nitroalkenes, oxidized sulfur species, and heterocycles). Further, the technology teaches the pollution prevention theme to younger generations of scientists and extends to in situ destruction of pollutants and hazardous waste.  Dr. Rajender S. Varma, Department of Chemistry and Texas Regional Institute for Environmental Studies, Sam Houston State University  Environmentally Benign Supramolecular Assemblies of Hydroquinones in Polaroid Instant Photography This technology represents the first example of supramolecular synthesis in a manufacturing system for pollution prevention. Using the concepts of molecular recognition and self-assembly, a new technique has been developed for the control of molecules within films and coatings. This process has a number of environmental benefits including reduced synthetic steps, reduced waste generation, reduced solvent usage, and the introduction of solventless or aqueous processing. Instead of performing several time consuming, solventbased, chemical reactions in order to synthesize a series of candidate compounds for structure activity studies, this technique allows for the addition of simple, inexpensive, 9  Dr. John Warner, Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts-- Boston Polaroid Corporation   readily available `complexing reagents.' For this to be successful as pollution prevention, these assemblies must significantly reduce the number of synthetic reactions carried out. Often the formation of these assemblies involve no organic solvents. The supramolecular structures can be constructed via solid state grinding or aqueous dispersing techniques.  Professor Marc A. Anderson, Water Chemistry Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison  Green Technolog y for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics The Green Technology for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics program is dedicated to both the fundamental understanding and practical environmental applications of microporous ceramic materials. These materials are typically used as thin porous films on a variety of supports for numerous applications. Such films are composed of nano-particulate oxides (i.e., 0.5 to 10 nm in diameter) that are either randomly close-packed to form membranes (i.e., 30 percent porosity) or more loosely packed to form catalysts, photocatalysts, and thin film energy storage devices. Because the particle size, surface chemistry, and particle packing of these oxides can be controlled, so can the pore size, pore size distribution, and the physical-chemical properties of these materials. As a result, the properties of these materials can be tailored for given applications which include reverse osmosis and gas separation membranes; high temperature membrane reactors; size and shape selective photolysis membranes; low temperature deep-oxidation catalysts; room temperature photocatalysts; and energy storage devices such as thin film batteries, ultracapacitors, and fuel cells. The Green Technology for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics program is illustrated using three examples: an indoor air cleaner for the complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds; an inorganic photoreactor for the size and shape selective synthesis of desired compounds with a minimum of waste; and, finally, an inexpensive, thin film ultracapacitor which exceeds the U.S. Department of Energy's near-term goal for this type of energy storage device.  Professor Larry T. Taylor, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties  A Nontoxic Liquid Metal Composition for Use as a Mercury Substitute Mercury is used extensively in switches and sensors, but it is toxic to humans and animals. In addition to being an excellent conductor of electricity, mercury has significant surface tension and, unlike any other metal known, remains fluid throughout a wide temperature range which encompasses 0 C. Because of these properties, mercury is found in numerous commercial products such as automobiles, thermostats, steam irons, pumps, computers, and even in tennis shoes. In each of these cases, mercury functions as a liquid electrical switch. Since billions of mercury switches are made worldwide each year, a nontoxic replacement appears highly desirable. A nontoxic, cost-effective alternative to mercury that has comparable performance characteristics has been identified at Virginia Tech. This green technology provides a gallium alloy containing indium, zinc, and copper that conducts electricity, freezes below 0 C, exhibits high surface tension, and possesses a very high boiling point and very low vapor pressure. In addition, nonmercury switches and sensors can replace mercury switches and sensors without modifying existing technology. Mercury also is used in temperature sensors, pressure activated switches, pumps and filters, slip rings, liquid mirror telescopes, fluid unions, dental amalgam, and in medical devices such as sphygmomanometers and bougies. The nonmercury material also can serve as a substitute for elemental mercury in a many of these applications.  10   Rational Design of Catalytic Reactions for Pollution Prevention Chemical products manufacturing is a major industrial source of toxic and hazardous chemicals. Catalytic technologies hold the key to the development of more environmentally benign chemical processes and for the continued improvement of existing processes. Historically, the design of chemical synthesis catalysts was extraordinarily empirical. Yields of desired products and operational characteristics were normally optimized based on suites of experiments run on catalysts made from various manufacturing conditions and blends. The ability to correlate catalyst behavior to catalyst surface features was extremely limited. Accordingly, predicting the desired catalyst features for a given application and, from that, formulating a catalyst manufacturing strategy, was essentially beyond reach. Moreover, the concept of redesigning catalysts so as to inhibit the formation of undesired coproducts, toxic materials, and wasteful pollutants was fanciful. A methodology for Rational Catalyst Technologies was developed at the University of Wisconsin that makes it possible to design and optimize catalysts by first understanding the nature of the desired catalyst surface and, from that, formulating the catalyst. This strategy for the rational design of catalytic reactions has found acceptance worldwide and has been applied successfully to link surface science research to the development of industrially important catalytic chemical reactions. Industrial collaborations or applications include ammonia catalysis, the environmental deNOx reaction, the water gas shift reaction on magnetite, titania surface species, molybdena and vanadia catalysts for clean partial oxidation of methane, and hydrocarbon cracking over acid Y-zeolite catalysts for the clean production of isobutylene.  Professor James A. Dumesic, Chemical Engineering Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison Dr. John C. Crittenden, National Center for Clean Industrial and Treatment Technologies, Michigan Technological University  The Replacement of Hazardous Organic Solvents with Water in the Manufacture of Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals The use of water as the primary solvent is a realistic approach to green chemistry and is a very desirable approach for reducing hazardous organic solvents from plant inventories. Multiphase reactors have been developed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and other universities that use water as the reaction medium in order to avoid the use of hazardous organic solvents in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. This is the first technology to show that free radical bromination of organics can be carried out in aqueous systems. A unique semicontinuous droplet reactor also has been developed for epoxidations. Before pollution prevention became fashionable, organic chemists found that water-based reactions gave higher yields at faster rates under milder conditions than organic solvent-based reactions. This is incentive enough for process change. The fact that these methods offer a new `non-end-of-pipe' method of eliminating volatile organic compounds adds a major incentive for process modification.  Dr. Henry Shaw, Chemistry and Environmental Science Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology Dr. Daniel J. Watts, Center for Environmental Engineering and Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology  The SYNGEN Program for Generation of Alternative Syntheses The SYNGEN program attempts to survey all possible synthetic routes to a target molecule and reduce the vast number of these possibilities quickly and stringently to focus on only the shortest and cheapest routes. The program first focuses on minimizing steps and the central role of prior skeletal dissection to find the best assemblies of the target skeleton from available starting skeletons. It then presents the ideal synthesis, of construction reactions only, to create the target just by sequential constructions uniting these starting skeletons. Finally, the digital basis rigorously, but concisely, defines all possible molecular structures and their reactions. This basis allows the new SYNGEN program to propose all 11  Professor James B. Hendrickson, Department of Chemistry, Brandeis University   of the short alternative syntheses of any product from real starting materials, in terms of both their cost and environmental impact.  Professor Tomas Hudlicky, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida  Synthetic Methodolog y `Without Reagents.' Tandem Enzymatic and Electrochemical Oxidations and Reductions in the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals The prevention of pollution at its source is addressed by the replacement of currently used methods of oxidation and reduction (all based on metal reagents) with enzymatic and electrochemical techniques (all performed in water, alcohols, or other environmentally acceptable solvents). The combination of enzymatic transformations with electrochemistry, along with efficient design, yields unprecedented brevity in the attainment of important pharmaceuticals from metabolites of the arene cis-diol type. Halogenated aromatic compounds, viewed in many cases as harmful to the environment, are enzymatically converted to useful synthons and effectively removed from the hazardous waste pool. The residual mass from enzymatic or electrochemical processes is judged suitable for disposal to municipal sewers, thus further reducing the amount of actual waste. The synthesis of a homochiral cyclitol from halobenzene by several steps involving essentially no reagents serves as the illustration of the technology. The nomination describes the strategy, logic, execution, and future projection of this program, which has potential global impact with attendant benefits to the health and economy of society through managed processing of aromatic waste to valuable substances. Several patents have already been granted on more efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical entities.  Professor David E. Nikles, Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama Professor J.W. Harrell, Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama Professor Alan M. Lane, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alabama Professor I.A. Jefcoat, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alabama  Waterborne Coating Applications for Video Tape Manufacture Magnetic tape technology is an important component of the information age and maintaining a domestic tape manufacturing capability is important to the U.S. economy. Magnetic tape is manufactured by a continuous web coating process that uses organic solvents, including tetrahydrofuran, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), toluene and cyclohexanone. MEK, MIBK, and toluene are on the list of 189 hazardous air pollutants and on the list of 18 chemicals for the EPA's 33/50 voluntary pollution reduction program. Waterborne magnetic tape coating formulations were designed at the University of Alabama and used to prepare experimental magnetic tape samples in a pilot coating trial. The formulations contained a blend of a water-dispersed polyester and an ethylene/vinyl chloride copolymer emulsion. The coatings were thermally cured with a melamine-formaldehyde cross-linker to give tensile properties that were comparable to a standard solvent-based binder composition. The pilot tape trial used existing processing equipment, including calendering and slitting. The tape had good magnetic properties and excellent adhesion between the pigmented magnetic layer and the base film, easily exceeding the 8 mm helical scan tape standard of 0.96 N peel force. An economic impact analysis for the case of using the waterborne video tape coating process in a conventional tape manufacturing plant showed an 11 percent decrease in hourly operating costs. The solvent-based process generated almost 650 kg of organic solvent per hour operation, while the waterborne process generated less than 5 kg methanol (from the melamine-formaldehyde cross-linker) per hour. In addition to pollution prevention, there was a clear economic incentive to adopt the waterborne video tape manufacturing process.  12   Entries From Small Businesses Catalytic Extraction Processing (CEP) Catalytic Extraction Processing (CEP) is a proprietary technology that uses secondary materials and byproducts (that might otherwise be considered `wastes') as raw materials in a manufacturing process. CEP manufactures commercial products (i.e., industrial gases, alloys, and ceramics) from heterogeneous organic, organometallic, and inorganic materials using a molten metal bath as both a catalyst for elemental dissociation and a solution for reaction engineering. CEP feed materials go through two stages in the metal bath: dissociation and dissolution of molecular entities to their elements and reaction of these elemental intermediates to form products. The waste minimization and environmental performance of CEP is ensured by the separation of feed from product through elemental dissociation and the predictable partitioning afforded by the control of thermodynamic operating conditions. Employed as an offsite, closed-loop process unit, CEP maximizes environmental performance for a broad spectrum of secondary materials and byproducts through pollution prevention, waste minimization, and decreased demand on ever-diminishing natural resources. Molten Metal Technology, Inc.  Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLECs) as Robust and Broadly Applicable Industrial Catalysts Enzymes are proteins that function as highly efficient and selective catalysts. Enzymes are responsible for the biochemical reactions that are essential to life, and as such, they are unique in their intrinsic compatibility with living organisms. Their potential as safe and efficient industrial catalysts has been long recognized, but to date, enzymes have not exhibited the chemical and physical stability associated with more conventional, small-molecule organic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysts. Altus Biologics has developed a conceptually simple and broadly applicable solution to this fundamental problemthe formulation of enzymes in a cross-linked crystalline formthat enables enzyme use under the harsh chemical, physical, and mechanical conditions that characterize most practical industrial processes. To date, more than 20 enzymes have been formulated as CLECs and have demonstrated their utility on a pilot scale: as industrial catalysts, in consumer products such as detergents and cosmetics, as medical and process biosensors, and in the decontamination of waste and hazardous chemicals including insecticides and nerve agents. Two applications out of this broad portfolio of uses are describedthe CLEC-catalyzed syntheses of the dipeptide artificial sweetener aspartame and of the semi-synthetic b-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic cephalexin. In these applications, an enhancement in synthetic efficiency has been demonstrated, with dramatic source reductions in the waste streams associated with these processes. In addition to the potential broad impact of the crosslinked enzyme crystal technology on source reduction, widespread application of CLECs might also serve to leverage America's investment in the area of molecular biology beyond the preeminence already established in the biotechnology industry prototype. Novel, though otherwise impractical, enzymes derived from that technological base could, through their stabilization as CLECs, lead to a penetration and dominance of the much larger and employment-intensive commodity- and fine-chemical manufacturing industry; driven by the economic benefits derived from the implementation of more efficient, competitive, and `greener' chemical manufacturing options.  Altus Biologics Inc.  13   Benchmark Products, Inc.  Development of a Nickel Brightener Solution Historically, electroplaters of duplex nickel had to use formaldehyde and coumarinbearing nickel plating solutions to obtain a nonsulfur nickel deposit, which is essential to the duplex nickel process, for maximum corrosion protection of external automotive trim and bumpers. The Watts' bath, introduced in 1916, made it possible to increase the speed of nickel deposit by a factor of ten by increasing the electrical current density. This development lead to the bright nickel plating baths known today, which use organic and inorganic additives. Organic aromatic sulfonic acid was later introduced to the Watts' bath to achieve the first practical bright nickel plating solution. In 1936, formaldehyde was added to the solution followed in rapid succession by other additives. Coumarin, along with formaldehyde, became the important ingredients in a variety of nickel plating baths referred to as `semibright'. Today, semibright nickel plating occupies an important position in plating. Benchmark Products has developed a nickel brightener solution that, while improving the performance of electroplating, also significantly reduces the environmental impact by eliminating two toxic ingredients, formaldehyde and coumarin, and substituting nonhazardous ingredients.  Circuit Research Corporation  A Nontoxic, Nonflammable, Aqueous-Based Cleaner/Degreaser and Associated Parts Washing Systems Commonly Employed in the Automotive Repair Industry Circuit Research Corporation developed an aqueous based cleaner and associated parts washing system commonly employed in the automotive repair industry that eliminates the generation of hazardous waste associated with current parts washing systems. Currently, the majority of parts washers employ a `Stoddard Solvent,' which, when spent, is manifested as a hazardous waste to a distillation facility that separates the solvent from the petroleum residue. The new technology employs a nontoxic, nonflammable, aqueousbased cleaner/degreaser that can be recycled continuously on site by employing oil/water separation and standard combustion engine filters. Both the oil separation and filtration apparati are housed within a recently developed parts washer unit, such that the aqueous cleaner/degreaser is recycled in-situ, eliminating the removal or transportation and special treatment of spent cleaner material off site. Testing results have shown that: (1) the resulting oil skimmed from the cleaner can, under current hazardous waste definitions, be managed as a `spent oil' and combined with spent engine oil for beneficial reuse as a secondary fuel, and (2) the filter can be managed under current methods used to recycle other used combustion engine oil filters. Circuit Research Corporation believes there are in excess of 7,000 parts washers in Minnesota generating approximately 1.5 million gallons of spent Stoddard Solvent annually. Circuit Research Corporation's alternative technology could significantly reduce the generation of this waste.  Radiance Services Company  The Radiance Process: A Quantum Leap in Green Chemistry The Radiance Process, a new water- and chemical-free method of cleaning surfaces, is a powerful alternative to existing wet chemical processes that use detergents; organic solvents, including CFCs and their successors; and acid or alkaline reagents. The Radiance Process employs the quantum mechanical effects of laser light and an inert gas, ordinarily nitrogen, to clean surfaces. The light lifts the contaminant from the surface and the flowing gas sweeps it away. There is no pollution and no waste besides the removed contaminant itself. The Radiance Process will lead to significant human health and envi14   ronmental benefits through source reduction by reducing toxicity, flammability, explosion potential, emissions, discharges, use of hazardous substances in reaction conditions, the transport of hazardous substances, and the creation of hazardous wastes. The process is inexpensive and readily adaptable to many manufacturing needs. The process has been demonstrated on a broad range of products including semiconductor materials, such as silicon wafers and chrome on quartz photomasks, and industrial metals such as tire molds, fuel injectors, brass fixtures, and metal beverage containers. Semiconductor International called Radiance a ""breakthrough."" Advancing Microelectronics called it ""radical."" Futuretech called it ""indispensable."" In December 1995, the Radiance Process was selected by IndustryWeek magazine as a Technology of the Year, one of only five, calling it ""revolutionary."" Radiance provides the ultimate Green Chemistry by completely eliminating the need for chemicals in cleaning while achieving equal or superior results at a lower cost.  SuperCTM, The Use of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide The process SuperCTM permanently consumes large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) to make less-expensive, more durable, fully recyclable products from industrial wastes or ordinary cements. Even earth will serve as a material. SuperCTM is an economical answer to global warming and large-scale pollution. It employs simple reactions to sequester CO2, preventing it from entering the atmosphere. It provides lower cost alternatives to forest products, steel, aluminum, plastics, composites, and ceramics by using industrial waste streams as feedstocks. It can lengthen the service life of new, and even restore existing, concrete structures and infrastructures. It can stabilize cemented mixed and high-level nuclear waste to facilitate long-term storage without further chemical evolution. Implementation/conversion requires minimal capital investment. The process uses supercritical CO2 (at greater than 88.3 F and greater than 1,071 PSI) to infiltrate fully formed products made from wastes like fly ash, blast furnace slag, dust, clay, or from common cements, to produce almost any desired properties or behaviors. In this state, CO2 behaves as a super solvent. Products made this way cost less, are equal or superior in performance to those made in traditional ways, and are fully recyclable without manual segregation. They displace products made from higher energy or ecologically sensitive materials, and reduce environmental impact, health concerns, and fossil fuel consumption.  Materials Technology Limited  Utilization of High Performance, Environmentally Compliant Chemicals: GREEN LINE Adhesive, Sealant, and Coating Technologies Astutely aware of the national strategy for protecting the environment and promoting energy efficiency in buildings, American Chemical Corporation developed the GREEN LINE, a complete stock of specialty adhesives, sealants, and coatings that utilize environmentally compliant polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic, latex, and epoxy resins technologies. All methodologies meet Best Available Technology (BAT) standards for minimizing VOC exposure, health risks, and hazardous handling practices. Concurrent with the technical development of GREEN LINE products was the conceptualization of Cost Benefit Algorithms and Dynamic Labeling, which permit federal managers to determine the degree of `green' compliance of the core materials used to manufacture the products and of the environmental improvements intended by use of such materials. Federal managers and their staffs are provided with reliable information that can help them make energy-saving, water-conserving, and maintenance improvements that solve environmental problems and provide for worker safety. GREEN LINE products have been successfully used to (1) reduce both energy use and the environmental impacts of HVAC and air handling distri15  American Chemical Corporation   bution system repairs and upgrades, (2) conserve potable water resources by facilitating the repair and rehabilitation of treatment, storage, and distribution systems, and (3) repair U.S. Naval ship structures.  Klenzoid, Inc.  Zero Discharge System For Cooling Towers The Zero Discharge system is a complete packaged water treatment system to control corrosion deposition and biological fouling with no water discharge (commonly known as `bleed-off ') from the system. This bleed-off is widely used by conventional water treatment programs to dilute the concentration of natural minerals in the water to prevent precipitation. In the Zero Discharge system, the recirculating cooling tower water is filtered by a side-stream filtration system to remove suspended solids. A microprocessor control monitors the prescribed characteristic of the recirculating water through sensors installed in a sample stream. The control maintains a programmed pH in the recirculating water along with prescribed levels of chemical treatment through actuation of chemical feed pumps. With these levels being maintained and monitored, the microprocessor, using stored tabular data, calculates the calcium content necessary to maintain a zero Langelier Saturation Index. The level of calcium is adjusted accordingly by regulating the flow of untreated raw water supplied to the tower as make-up through a bypass of a calcium removal (e.g., water softener or deionizer) system on the makeup water line. The health and environmental benefits of the Zero Discharge system are the result of the water saved and the significant reduction of chemicals discharged to the environment. The Zero Discharge system was patented in the early 1990s and has since been extensively applied in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. In total, about 30,000 tons of cooling water are being treated by the Zero Discharge system, which saves about 132 million gallons of water in the Philadelphia area annually.  16   Entries From Industry and Government AGROTAIN N-(n-butyl) Thiophosphoric Triamide Urea is now the favored form of solid nitrogen-containing fertilizer and is rapidly displacing anhydrous ammonia in the nitrogen fertilizer market. The market share of world nitrogen consumption has risen from 5 percent in 1962 to 37 percent in 1986 for urea. There are many reasons for this increase. Urea is a source of nitrogen for crop fertilization that is easily handled and transported, higher in nitrogen content than other common solid nitrogen fertilizers, and can be readily bulk blended with other fertilizer components, such as potassium chloride, diammonium phosphate, and other materials, to prepare multinutrient fertilizers. While urea has many advantages over other nitrogen sources and has already captured a greatly increasing market share, a major drawback to the use of urea is its tendency to lose a substantial portion of the nitrogen values by ammonia volatilization. These losses can easily exceed 30 percent of the available nitrogen in urea under certain climatic and soil conditions. AGROTAIN is a formulation containing N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) as the active ingredient, or, more correctly, the precursor to the active ingredient, which is the oxygen analog of NBPT. NBPT is a urease enzyme inhibitor that inhibits the hydrolysis of urea by inhibiting the activity of the urease enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea. This activity is the result of an interaction between the urease enzyme and the urease inhibitor. There is no interaction with soil microbes that generate the urease enzyme. Moreover, the recommended NBPT treatment rate is only 0.4 lbs/acre, and NBPT is relatively unstable and presents no problems with long-term buildup in the soil. The use of NBPT with urea also is ideally suited for no-till agriculture applications. No-till agriculture is an environmentally friendly approach that involves little or no disturbance of the topsoil, resulting in less soil erosion and less energy intensive operation. Urea, however, has not been well suited for use with surface-applied no-till applications until the advent of NBPT because of the possibility of substantial ammonia volatilization losses. IMC-Agrico Company  Alkyl Polyglycoside Surfactants Henkel Corporation's alkyl polyglycoside (APG) surfactants are a class of nonionic surfactants that have been pioneered and marketed to the detergent and personal care industries under the Glucopon and Plantaren trade names since 1992 and 1990, respectively. APG surfactants are manufactured from renewable resources including fatty alcohol, derived from coconut and palm oils, and glucose, derived from corn starch. APG surfactants are more innocuous to the environment than petrochemical-based technologies, are readily biodegradable, and have very low ecotoxicity. APG surfactants are highly efficient cleaners and have led to a significant reduction in overall chemical consumption in cleaner formulations and ultimately the amount of chemicals released to the environment. APG surfactants also permit the formulation of concentrated cleaners that require less consumer product packaging and consequently reduce packaging waste. APG surfactants are considerably less toxic and safer to humans and the environment than other major surfactants. APG surfactants permit the formulation of less irritating and safer consumer products and significantly reduce the possible environmental impact associated with an accidental spill. Henkel Corporation's 50 million pound per year APG surfactant plant 17  Henkel Corporation   has been operating in Cincinnati, Ohio, since 1992. A second plant was started up in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1995, by Henkel Corporations's parent company, Henkel KGaA.  U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing  An Alternative Solvent, Isomet The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (the Bureau), the world's largest security manufacturing establishment, produces currency, postage stamps, revenue stamps, naturalization certificates, U.S. savings bonds, and other government securities and documents. Until 1991, Typewash, a solvent mixture, was used by the Bureau for cleaning typographic seals and serial numbers of the COPE-Pack (overprinting presses) and for cleaning of sleeves of postage stamp presses. Typewash is a solvent mixture composed of methylene chloride (55 percent), toluene (25 percent), and acetone (20 percent). The use of Typewash was no longer in compliance with the District of Columbia Environmental Law and the Federal Air Toxic Law. An alternative solvent, Isomet, was designed and developed to replace Typewash. Isomet is a mixture of isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (55 percent), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (10 percent), and isopropyl alcohol (35 percent). Isomet is less toxic, less polluting, and environmentally friendly. Isomet was found to be acceptable in the areas of (1) cleaning ability, (2) solvent evaporation rate, (3) solvent odor, (4) environmental and safety compliance, and (5) cost. Thus, a solvent discharged at the rate of 7,500 gallons per year was made environmentally friendly. The performance of Isomet is excellent and it has been used for cleaning all postage stamp and overprinting presses in the Bureau.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Application of Freeze Drying Technolog y to the Separation of Complex Nuclear Waste The nuclear industry must comply with increasingly stringent standards for radioactive material levels present in liquid effluents. Current conventional methods of decontamination include distillation, ion exchange, precipitation reactions, or chelating agents. Freeze drying technology (FDT) has been applied to the decontamination of radioactive liquids and shown to be thousands of times more effective than conventional methods. Distillation, ion exchange, and chelating agents often require multiple passes, and because additional components (e.g., resins or chelating agents, which in turn must be disposed of as radioactive) are typically required for these methods, reductions in the volume of radioactive waste are rarely realized. FDT will efficiently separate solvents and volatile acids from complex waste solutions and process liquids. The separated liquids will be virtually free of radioactive contamination and can be reused or discarded as nonradioactive. FDT will drastically reduce the volume of radioactive wastes. Volume reductions greater than 1,000 times have been achieved in aqueous solutions, but the exact volume reduction of nuclear waste will depend on its moisture content. FDT will eliminate the need for storage or destruction of the liquid component and will lower transportation costs because of volume and weight reductions. In addition, this technology can be considered safe; no high temperatures or pressures are used. The process occurs in a vacuum, so the failure of a component would lead to an inward leak and the potential for contamination outside the system is significantly reduced. Finally, the refrigerant used in this technology is environmentally friendly liquid nitrogen.  18   Application of Green Chemistry Principles to Eliminate Air Pollution From the Mexican Brickmaking Microindustry A new recirculating design for small brickmaking kilns was investigated as an alternative to conventional operations, which are a significant source of air pollution. The bricks used in building many houses and office buildings in Mexico and other parts of the third world are typically made by hand and fired in small kilns using available fuels such as sawdust, treated wood, paper, trash, tires, plastic, and used motor oil. Although these bricks cost about half of standard high-fired construction bricks, they do not meet the minimum strength requirements for commercial construction in the United States. In addition, a major byproduct of this brickmaking industry is a high level of air pollution--both particulates and toxic chemicals--that results from inefficient thermal design of the kilns and the use of cheap but readily available fuels. This industry is the third leading cause of air pollution in the El Paso-Jurez area. Redesign of the kilns to allow efficient energy recovery and to eliminate waste from over- and under-firing makes the use of nonpolluting fuels (e.g., natural gas) economically attractive. The design challenge is to use inexpensive, readily available materials and equipment to avoid significant capital outlay. Laboratory investigations and process modeling were performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and field tests are being performed at ECOTEC in Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, in cooperation with FEMAP, a private foundation in Mexico, and with the El Paso Natural Gas Company. The direct benefits of these improvements in the brickmaking process are reduced air pollution, safer operating conditions, and better bricks. In addition, process modeling indicates that fuel consumption can be reduced by approximately 55 percent and cost analyses project that this will result in an increase in profit of about 35 percent for the brickmakers.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Application of Microchemistry Technolog y to the Analysis of Environmental Samples `Green' chemistry is an umbrella term addressing such related concepts as waste minimization, pollution prevention, solvent substitution, environmentally conscious manufacturing, maximum atom utilization, technologies for a sustainable future, environmental security, and industrial ecology. Another applicable concept, microscale chemistry (or microchemistry), is the application of chemical principles and apparatus at a scale much smaller than currently employed by most bench chemists, thus reducing the volume of reagents and product by several orders of magnitude. Microscale and green chemistries both incorporate waste minimization, pollution prevention, and solvent substitution. Adoption of green and microscale methods is increasingly essential for the environmental analytical community as regulations tighten, the costs of waste disposal escalate, and public scrutiny increases. By applying green chemistry principles and using advances in separation science, instrumentation, microscale techniques, and solvent substitution, chemists at Argonne National Laboratory developed trace environmental analysis methods that incorporate source reduction. The techniques reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous solvents, decrease analysis turnaround time, and significantly reduce the generation of secondary wastes associated with analytical processing. The success of these methods exemplifies the opportunities to reduce waste generation at analytical laboratories across the country. With appropriate institutional advocacy, these principles can be applied broadly to this large chemical sector.

After the useful life of some products, the final disposition depends on various options. The products can enter the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream to a landfill, an incinerator, or an incinerator with electricity/steam production. They also can be discarded on land or at sea, be recycled by industry, or be reused for another purpose by the consumer. One growing option, which Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766 is designed to complement, is composting. This is a process that essentially mimics nature's biodegradation process (i.e., carbon cycle) and has been used over the ages to various degrees. The process is now recognized to have various benefits, one of which is the reduction of the amount of waste to landfills or incinerators (both of which are expensive to build and maintain, not to mention the problems inherent with siting a new one). In addition, the compost resulting from biodegradation is a soil amendment that adds water retention and other benefits to soils. In fact, such a compost is more beneficial to agricultural soil regeneration than chemical fertilizers. Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766, a patented aliphatic/aromatic copolyester of adipic acid, terephthalic acid, and 1,4butanediol, was engineered to decompose under proper conditions into water, carbon dioxide, and biomass. This innovative new product also exhibits such features as low cost, tensile properties similar to low density polyethylene (LDPE), and a soft feel, and is blendable with natural polymers such as starch. Extensive biodegradation and toxicity evaluations demonstrated definitively that Eastman's new product biodegrades completely at rates comparable to paper without negatively impacting the ecosystem. The material can be extruded into blown film, extrusion coated, and spun into fiber. A plethora of applications is envisioned for Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766 including compost bags, personal hygiene items, medical products, and coated paper and board.  Eastman Chemical Company  Biofiltration Technolog y Biofiltration has been used for decades in the United States in towns and cities for odor control, and has also been used in Europe. American companies, however, have been hesitant to consider the natural process because it is so different from the widely accepted conventional control technologies. As part of Tennessee Eastman Division's (TED) Odor Identification and Control Program, a 1,400 cubic feet per minute gas stream was determined to be a `priority' odor source. Though the vent was, at the time, treated by a 12C-20 caustic scrubber, a hydrogen sulfide odor was detected. One obvious solution to the odor problem was to increase the frequency of the caustic changeouts. This increased frequency would greatly increase the operation expenses for the scrubber as well as expose operations to greater risks of caustic burns resulting from the increased handling requirements. As an alternative to caustic treatment, biofiltration was investigated as a possible solution. In biofiltration, micro-organisms supported on a stationary porous media bed are used to destroy pollutants from waste gases flowing through the bed. The micro-organisms commonly occur in nature, and various media are excellent candidates for sustaining the micro-organisms and harboring their nutrients. In July 1993, a pilot biofilter was set up to test its effectiveness on hydrogen sulfide removal. The pilot biofilter proved that biofiltration was a technically feasible and economically attractive alternative to the 12C-20 caustic scrubber for hydrogen sulfide removal from the vent gas stream. Due to this success, a fullscale biofilter, 12C-1022, was installed in December 1995 to replace the 12C-20 caustic scrubber.  20   CleanSystem3 Gasoline Internal combustion engines produce considerable amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) as a combustion byproduct. NOx are an air pollutant in their own right and react with atmospheric organic compounds in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, a powerful respiratory irritant. Despite a 76 percent reduction in allowable NOx emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles over the past 25 years, U.S. motor vehicles still emit 3 million tons of NOx each year. Source reduction in the context of vehicular NOx means less NOx generated in the engine. Steps in this direction have been few (primarily exhaust gas recirculation) and, being a design feature, are not applicable to older vehicles. There is, therefore, a genuine opportunity for technology which can reduce the NOx generated in vehicle engines on the road today. Texaco has developed and introduced a patented additive technology based on novel chemistry which reduces NOx formation in gasoline engines. This additive is present in all CleanSystem3 gasoline sold in the United States. Controlled vehicle testing has demonstrated reductions in tailpipe NOx up to 22 percent. This additive fulfills the role of traditional deposit control (`detergent') additives in keeping fuel system components clean, and provides additional performance in the area of preventing and removing combustion chamber deposits. Cleaner combustion chambers retain less combustion heat from one engine cycle to the next, and the resulting lower temperature leads to the formation of fewer NOx.  Texaco, Inc.  Development and Implementation of Low Vapor Pressure Cleaning Solvent Blends and Waste Cloth Management Systems to Capture Cleaning Solvent Emissions Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems (LMTAS) (formerly General Dynamics Fort Worth Division) has developed low vapor pressure organic solvents. LMTAS patented these solvent blends and the technology is being used by the aerospace industry, the military, and various industries. Additionally LMTAS substituted one of the new solvent blends (DS-104) for a CFC-113 based general purpose cleaning solvent used in the surface wiping of aircraft parts, components, and assemblies in all aspects of aircraft manufacturing. The substitution resulted in major reductions in solvent use and air emissions, the elimination of ozone depleting compounds from cleaning during aircraft assembly, cost reductions, and improved chemical handling and usage practices. From 1986 to 1992, LMTAS produced mainly F-16 fighter aircraft at a rate of 220 to 350 aircraft per year. Throughout the 6 years, LMTAS used a general purpose wipe solvent containing 85 percent CFC-113 by weight throughout the manufacturing process. The use of the CFC-113 solvent blend resulted in the emission of approximately 255 tons per year of CFC-113 and 45 tons per year of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The implementation of DS-104 at LMTAS has reduced wipe solvent VOC emissions to 7 tons per year in 1993, 3 tons per year in 1994, and 2 tons per year in 1995, with no CFC emissions. After the LMTAS implementation, other companies and military operations throughout the United States have implemented this technology. Additionally, this technology has been implemented in several countries, such as Australia, Canada, Greece, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. Several other European countries will implement this technology in 1997. This technology was developed primarily for aerospace; however, it has found applications in many other industries such as automotive, various prison manufacturing operations, postal operations, electronics, building maintenance, steel, and nondestructive testing methods.  Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems  21   Rochester Midland Corporation  Development of a New `Core' Line of Cleaners Cleaning is an important practice and necessity of modern civilization. An effective cleaner must be able to penetrate through soil to disrupt and destroy the complicated types of bonding that cause it to adhere to the surface being cleaned. Most modern cleaners are comprised of surface active agents derived from petrochemical resources. While these components are effective, they tend to be environmentally harsh and depend upon a natural resource whose supply is finite and limited. The market for these products is estimated to be in the range of $5 billion, which equates to approximately 5 billion pounds of product annually. The impact of developing chemistries that are less polluting during the extraction, manufacturing, use, and disposal of these products is, therefore, quite significant, as are the human health and safety impacts. During the past few years a new family of cleaners was developed that are less toxic and have reduced impacts to both people and the environment when compared to traditional products used for the same purpose. The chemistries incorporated into these products resulted in products that are readily biodegradable, comprised of zero to very low volatile organic components and ozone depleting substances, effective in their intended purpose (i.e., cleaning), and economically competitive. In addition, these products have low human and aquatic toxicity and low corrosivity. Main molecular components of these products are derived from renewable, bio-based resources that are lower polluting and typically less toxic than their petrochemical alternatives. This new `core' line of cleaners is an innovative approach to the formulation of an important series of products and is the safest yet developed in its field.  U.S. Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  DOE Methods for Evaluating Environmental and Waste Management Samples DOE Methods for Evaluating Environmental and Waste Management Samples (DOE Methods) is a document that provides new technology and consolidated methods to analytical chemistry laboratories around the country. These laboratories are working on one of the world's most challenging environmental issues: Cold War legacy waste. Sampling and analytical technologies that minimize waste production are given priority over traditional methods. It has been demonstrated, for example, that some of the technologies produce 60 to 70 percent less hazardous and radioactive waste than other available technologies. The guidance information in DOE Methods also helps minimize the number of analyses and saves time and money. Guidelines are provided on how to (1) efficiently develop a sampling and analysis program, (2) effectively and efficiently sample waste, (3) handle radioactive samples safely, and (4) select appropriate analytical methods. Cross references allow the users to select from currently available standard methodologies. DOE Methods has been available for both DOE and commercial use since 1992. It is updated every 6 months, thereby accelerating the release of new technology to speed EM operations. The significance of the document is in its unique application to the analysis of radioactive components and highly radioactive mixed waste. The document currently contains about 65 sampling and analytical methods, many of which are focused on the mixed-waste issue. The highly challenging world of environmental problems cannot be solved without effective sampling and analytical methods. DOE Methods takes a major step in the resolution of this problem.  22   DryWashTM Carbon Dioxide Dry Cleaning Technolog y DryWashTM is a patented, Hughes-specific liquid carbon dioxide garment dry cleaning technology and is a safe, ecologically acceptable, and cost effective alternative dry cleaning process. Currently, the dry cleaning industry uses perchloroethylene (PCE) (85 percent of establishments), petroleum-based or stoddard solvents (12 percent of establishments), CFC-113 (less than 2 percent of establishments), and 1,1,1 trichloroethane. All conventional dry cleaning solvents present health risks, safety risks, or are environmentally detrimental. PCE is a suspected carcinogen, petroleum-based solvents are flammable and smog producing, and CFC-113 is an ozone depletor and targeted to be phased out by the end of 1995. Health risks due to exposure to cleaning solvents and the high costs of implementing and complying with safety and environmental restrictions and regulations, have made dry cleaning a much more difficult business in which to achieve profitability. Solvents are suspected of contaminating ground water, air, and food products (i.e., in nearby markets). For these reasons, there is an ongoing search for alternative, safe, and environmentally friendly cleaning technologies, substitute solvents, and methods to control exposure to dry cleaning chemicals. DryWashTM reuses carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring byproduct of combustion that is a readily available, inexpensive, and unlimited natural resource. It is also chemically stable, noncorrosive, nonflammable, nonozone depleting, and nonsmog producing. Performance has been demonstrated to major dry cleaning equipment manufacturers worldwide and to the EPA. Actual garments, along with International Fabricare Institute (IFI) standardized cleaning test fabrics, were used for the demonstrations. The performance of the DryWashTM cleaning process was quantified favorably against commercial perchloroethylene cleaning by Los Alamos National Laboratory, using IFI standards.  Hughes Environmental Systems, Inc.  The DUCARE `Zero Effluent' Recycle Chemistry System The printing and publishing pre-press industry is undergoing a revolutionary change driven by advances in imaging technology from a craft-based industry to one relying far more on digital imaging and printing technology. From a user perspective, this new technology is more environmentally benign than the process it replaces. Several iterations of improvements in hardware and software will be required before digital imaging completely replaces conventional chemical imaging. The DUCARE system is a `bridge' between the current and developing systems. It is designed as a `drop in' for conventional processing and enables the customer to continue utilizing their current equipment, thus avoiding a financial burden while still eliminating the adverse environmental impact. DUCARE is an environmentally proactive way for customers to prevent any film processor effluent from going down their drain. Typically, customers discharge the effluent to the drain, pay to have it hauled away and disposed, or use expensive high maintenance equipment for onsite treatment. The effluent contains hazardous chemicals (as defined by SARA Title III), very high BOD and COD, and high silver and pH extremes. DUCARE, offered only by DuPont, solves these problems using several industry firsts. A new developer was invented which has no SARA Title III chemicals and is based on a vitamin C isomer. The chemistry is designed to use 25 to 40 percent less product than conventional chemistry and is recycled at its manufacturing sites to insure high quality and `like new' performance. The wash-water recirculating unit reduces water use up to 99 percent. This system can be used worldwide, wherever a cost effective reverse distribution system can be set up.  DuPont Company  23   California-Pacific Lab & Consulting  The ECO Funnel The ECO Funnel and Container is a new product designed to prevent volatile toxic air contaminants from evaporating into the laboratory work environment and into the atmosphere through the laboratory fume hood system. Typically, a simple funnel is used in pouring waste solvent into a waste bottle or carboy. In most cases, the funnel is left on top of the bottle permanently during the day, resulting in significant emission due to evaporation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the bottle into the laborator y environment or fume hood. It may seem that contamination of the atmosphere from such sources may not be large enough to be important or significant; however, exact measurements have proven the contrary. For example, an 8-liter carboy filled with 8 liters of dichloromethane will emit 500 mL (1.5 pounds) of this solvent into the atmosphere in 5 days. The emission will vary depending on the type of solvents used. The fume hood face velocity also can affect the evaporation rate. However, for a typical fume hood at 700 cubic feet per minute and a typical 4 liter waste bottle with a regular funnel containing 1000 mL tetrahydrofuran, 1000 mL acetone, and 1500 mL dichloromethane, the emission rate was 0.09 pounds per 8 hours or 33 pounds per year. California-Pacific Lab and Consulting designed and patented a new funnel that has a lid connected to a shut-off ball that double seals the system. The funnel stem is also longer and sealed to the bottle cap in order to prevent emission from the side of the stem. Under the same conditions as described above for the 4-liter waste bottle with a standard funnel, the ECO Funnel and Container resulted in zero emissions.  IBM-Austin  Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Chemicals in the Printed Wire Board and Electronic Assembly and Test Processes IBM-Austin is a manufacturing and development facility. Operations include the manufacture of printed wire board (PWB) in the Panel Plant facility and electronic circuit cards in the Electronic Card Assembly and Test (ECAT) facility. In 1992, IBM-Austin completely eliminated the use of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances from its PWB and ECAT processes. This elimination program resulted in 100 percent reduction of CFC113 (1988 peak usage of approximately 432,000 pounds) and 100 percent reduction of methyl chloroform (1988 peak usage of approximately 308,000 pounds) from IBMAustin's PWB and ECAT processes. These accomplishments were achieved by converting to an aqueous-based photolithographic process in the PWB facility in 1989, an interim aqueous cleaning process in the ECAT facility in 1991 and 1992, and a final No-Clean process (eliminating the aqueous cleaning process) in the ECAT facility. Changing from a solvent-based photolithographic process to an aqueous-based process eliminated methyl chloroform (MCF) from PWB panel manufacturing (1988 usage of 181,000 pounds). The interim process changes to aqueous cleaning eliminated MCF from manufacturing processes in ECAT (1989 peak usage of 196,000 pounds) and were largely responsible for eliminating CFC-113 from all manufacturing processes at the IBM site. Although CFC113 was eliminated from the site in 1991 and MCF was eliminated in 1992, ECAT 's ultimate goal was to convert all ECAT processes to No-Clean manufacturing processes. This conversion was completed in 1993.  24   Environmental Improvements From Redesigning the Commercial Manufacture of Progesterone For more than 40 years, the steroid bisnoraldehyde (BNA) has been produced at Pharmacia & Upjohn because it is a key intermediate for the commercial synthesis of progesterone and corticosteroid classes of pharmaceuticals. Recently, a redesigned route to BNA was implemented. This new synthetic route to progesterone is founded on both the development of a new fermentation process which improves the utilization of a renewable, naturally derived feedstock from 15 to 100 percent, and the development of a chemical oxidation process that offers high selectivity and reduced waste streams. The fermentation employs a genetically modified bacterium to convert soya sterols directly to a new synthetic intermediate, bisnoralcohol. The new chemical process oxidizes bisnoralcohol to bisnoraldehyde, a key intermediate for the registered, commercial manufacture of progesterone. Contrary to standard chemical methods for oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes, the nominated process does not use hazardous or noxious materials and does not generate toxic waste streams. The new bisnoralcohol route exemplifies the synergism possible between biochemical and chemical process development. It eliminated a process with a running, recycled inventory of 60,000 gallons of ethylene dichloride (EDC), a known carcinogen, which needed up to 5,000 gallons of EDC input annually. The new route produces the same amount of product as the previous route with 89 percent less nonrecoverable organic solvent waste and 79 percent less aqueous waste. The new route also has the chemical selectivity required for high quality bulk pharmaceutical manufacture and can be applied to the oxidation of other primary alcohols. By implementing this redesigned, commercial synthesis of BNA, Pharmacia & Upjohn has substantially reduced the chemical waste associated with manufacturing progesterone, while simultaneously improving process economics through a dramatic increase in feedstock utilization.  Pharmacia & Upjohn  Environmentally-Driven Preparation of Insensitive Energetic Materials An innovative approach was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to synthesize 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) and other insensitive energetic materials through the use of Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution chemistry (VNS). TATB is a reasonably powerful insensitive high explosive (IHE), whose thermal and shock stability is considerably greater than that of any other known material of comparable energy. The high cost of TATB ($100 per pound) has precluded its use for civilian applications such as deep-hole oil explorations. TATB is manufactured in the United States by nitration of the relatively expensive and domestically unavailable 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB) to give 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TCTNB), which is then aminated to yield TATB. The new VNS method developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for the synthesis of TATB has many `environmentally friendly' advantages over the current method of synthesis of TATB. Most significantly, it allows the elimination of chlorinated species from the synthesis of insensitive energetic materials. The new synthesis of TATB uses unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), a surplus propellant from the former Soviet Union, and ammonium picrate (Explosive D), a high explosive, as starting materials in lieu of the chlorinated species, TCB. Several million pounds of Explosive D are targeted for disposal in the United States; 30,000 metric tons of UDMH also await disposal in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. The use of these surplus energetic materials as feedstocks in the new VNS method of synthesizing TATB allows an improved method of demilitarization of conventional munitions that also should offer significant savings in production, thereby making this IHE more accessible for civilian applications.  U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Munitions U.S. Department of Energy, Weapons Supported Research Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  25   Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems  Implementation and Verification of Aqueous Alkaline Cleaners Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems (LMTAS) was the first aerospace company to implement innovative aqueous cleaning technology for cleaning tubing and honeycomb core. Tubing is used in the aerospace industry for transferring pressurized oxygen within an aerospace vehicle. Honeycomb core is used in the aerospace industry for producing bonded structural parts. Both applications require that the parts meet stringent cleanliness requirements. These requirements were previously met by using cold cleaning or vapor degreasing with chlorinated solvents. These solvents included 1,1,1-trichloethane (TCA) and trichloroethylene (TCE). These chlorinated solvents are toxic, and TCA is an ozone depleting compound. The use of chlorinated solvents posed a threat to the environment because the solvents were commonly released into the air during cleaning operations and because the likelihood of a spill during their use was significant. These solvents were successfully replaced with aqueous cleaning technology. As of November 1993, 100 percent of tubing manufactured at LMTAS (including oxygen tubing) is being cleaned in an aqueous cleaning system. As of May 1994, 100 percent of all honeycomb core used at LMTAS is also being cleaned in an aqueous cleaning system. Implementation of aqueous cleaning technology at LMTAS eliminated approximately 360 tons of air emissions per year and resulted in a cost savings of $490,000 per year. In addition to replacing chlorinated solvents with the innovative aqueous cleaning technology, LMTAS also explored the use of environmentally safe methods for quantifying surface contaminants on parts cleaned by various cleaning technologies. Traditionally, extraction with CFC-113 followed by gravimetric or FTIR analysis has been used for quantifying surface contaminants. The use of CFC-113 is undesirable due to its ozone depleting potential. LMTAS has demonstrated the usefulness of carbon dioxide coulometry for determining the amount of residue remaining on a surface after cleaning and has used this technique for comparing the cleaning effectiveness of various cleaning technologies.  DuPont Company  The INFINITY Process The INFINITY dyeing process was developed as an alternative method to manage the dyeing cycle for nylon textiles. Over 8 billion pounds of nylon textiles are consumed each year and most are dyed to meet aesthetic and functional demands. In the United States alone, consumption of dyes for nylon exceeds 30 million pounds, much of which is left in the spent dye bath after the fabric is dyed. This waste must be treated to avoid pollution of downstream waterways. Mills are meeting regulatory requirements through conventional process control techniques and end-of-pipe treatment. The INFINITY dyeing process lets mills reduce their consumption of dyes and other chemicals by 25 percent, and, in some applications, water and steam use per dye cycle is cut in half. Conventional methods use up to 4,000 gallons of water, 20 pounds of dye, and 10 pounds of dye assist chemicals per 1,000 pounds of fabric. The INFINITY dyeing process uses only 75 percent of the dye previously required, half the water, and less dye assist chemicals to get the same fabric color. In addition, dye discharge into mill effluent streams can be reduced as much as tenfold. A mill with a 90 percent exhaust rate may discharge 500 pounds of unused dye into the mill's wastewater treatment stream each week. With INFINITY, the same mill can move to 99 percent exhaust, reducing the amount of dye discharged to 50 pounds per week; a significant step toward attacking waste at the source. The process is currently being used at nylon textile mills in the United States, and work has begun on the feasibility of using the process on wool, cotton, and polyester blend fabrics. Cost savings by most mills using this process could easily exceed $100,000 per year.  26   Innovative Techniques for Chemical and Waste Reductions in the Printed Wire Board Circuitize Process IBM produces 1.7 million square feet of multilayer circuit boards per year in a manufacturing plant in north Austin, Texas. Aqueous chemical baths and rinse water are processed at a pretreatment plant where acidity is neutralized and dissolved copper is removed prior to discharge to a sanitary sewer for further treatment in a POTW. In 1991, the treatment process produced 1,417 tons of metal hydroxide sludge, a RCRA F006 hazardous waste. In 1992, a team of environmental engineers, manufacturing engineers, and laboratory personnel was formed to reduce hazardous waste sludge generation at the water treatment plant by minimizing waste generation in the imaging line. Areas of key importance to sludge reduction were identified as acid used in cleaning operations and developing solutions used prior to etching operations. Minimizing acid in the waste water reduces the amount of lime needed to neutralize the waste water. Reducing the developing solution reduces the carbonates in the waste water that precipitate as calcium carbonate in the presence of lime. By 1994, the team accomplished a 90 percent reduction in hydrochloric acid used in cleaning for an annual savings of approximately $340,000 in chemical cost. Additional work allowed for a 40 percent reduction of developing and stripping solutions used in the imaging area, for an annual savings of approximately $75,000. These changes resulted in an approximately 75 percent decrease in use of lime at the pretreatment plant. This decrease, in combination with reduced carbonate usage in developing solutions, resulted in a decrease in sludge production of over 670 tons per year (based on first half 1994 results) and a 47 percent reduction from 1991 sludge generation, for an additional savings of $250,000 in sludge disposal costs. This project has shown that waste minimization through chemical source reduction can reduce expenses as well as reduce waste.  IBM-Austin  INVERT Solvents in Aircraft Paint Stripping Recent changes in regulations affecting the aircraft stripping industry have resulted in increased research into new, more environmentally and toxicologically friendly formulations. The Dow Chemical Company has developed a new line of solvent continuous microemulsions, which have merit in aircraft paint stripping, to aid in the reduction of regulated chemicals as well as lower flammability and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels. These solvent products are marketed under the INVERT trademark. Formulating with INVERT solvents allows for the inclusion of greater than 40 percent water in aircraft paint strippers so that worker exposure to chemicals, flammability, and VOC levels can be reduced. INVERT solvents are solvent continuous microemulsions that contain approximately 50 percent water, low surfactant levels (i.e., less than 5 percent), and approximately 45 percent solvents and cosolvents. Paint stripping formulations can easily be prepared, using INVERT as a base, through the addition of active stripping solvents along with performance enhancing ingredients such as thickeners, activators, and evaporation retardants. Hydrocarbon-based stripper formulations often have low flash points and high VOC levels. The incorporation of water significantly increases fire point, and water addition reduces VOC levels. INVERT solvents offer an economical and effective way to incorporate water into hydrocarbon-based strippers to reduce flammability and VOC concerns without sacrificing performance. When methylene chloride is used as a stripping solvent, exposure and regulatory issues may call for a reduction in use level. The use of INVERT solvent technology allows preparation of solvent continuous microemulsions with low methylene chloride content (i.e., less than 20 percent), while maintaining an excellent level of performance. The use of INVERT solvents in the aircraft stripping industry allows users to reduce worker exposure to regulated chemicals and to reduce emissions of volatile chemicals, while maintaining a high standard of performance and economic benefit. 27  The Dow Chemical Company   Praxair, Inc.  Liquid Oxidation Reactor (LOR) Praxair, Inc. has developed a unique process that allows the safe oxidation of organic chemicals with pure or nearly pure oxygen. This technology, known as the Liquid Oxidation Reactor (LOR), provides significant environmental advantages compared to conventional, air-based oxidation processes. The use of oxygen in place of air reduces the total gas throughput to the reactor, thereby reducing the compression energy and the amount of vent gas that must be treated prior to atmospheric release. In addition, the oxygen use can positively affect the chemistry of the reaction, allowing the operation of the process at lower temperatures or pressures, thereby improving selectivity without sacrificing production rate. The use of the Praxair LOR increases the overall rate of reaction and volumetric productivity of hydrocarbon oxidations while increasing selectivity and reducing the loss of solvent and reactant to carbon oxides. The increased chemical efficiency with oxygen results in substantial raw materials cost saving, and a 96 percent reduction in the quantity of waste gases. The cost of product purification and waste disposal is reduced substantially. In addition, the lower temperature operations afforded by the LOR process reduces the loss of reactant or solvent to byproducts and to waste streams that also can contribute to environmental problems and must be treated prior to release. The LOR will enable a large and important segment of the U.S. chemical industry to realize more efficient use of raw materials, reduced environmental emissions, and energy savings. Because the LOR also allows for higher productivity, lower capital costs, and, consequently, improves competitiveness, there are significant incentives for the implementation of the technology. Average operating-cost savings and productivity gains worth $5 to $20 million per plant per year have been projected.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Magnetic Separation for Treatment of Radioactive Liquid Waste High Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) is the application of intense magnetic fields to selectively separate solids from other solids, liquids, or gases. The HGMS process has demonstrated promise for the treatment of waste streams containing actinide at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The caustic liquid waste generated by operations in the LANL Plutonium Processing Facility (TA-55) can produce up to 30,000 L of liquid effluent annually, with an average alpha activity of 1010 dpm/L. Treatment and disposal of the liquid effluents at the LANL Waste Water Treatment Facility (TA-50) can ultimately produce up to 15 tons of TRU solid waste per year. In order to avoid the TA-50 treatment, the goal at TA-55 is to reduce the radioactivity in the waste streams to less than 5.8 x 105 dpm/L. Physical separation processes, such as HGMS, are particularly attractive because no additional waste is generated during processing. HGMS is capable of concentrating the actinides in process waste streams to form a low volume, actinide-rich stream for recycling, and a high-volume, actinide-lean stream for direct discard. The proposed technology has been demonstrated successfully on a laboratory scale at TA-55 where results from screening experiments on radioactive caustic liquid waste water indicate that over 99.9 percent extraction of Pu activity can be achieved using HGMS (represents decontamination levels of three orders of magnitude to about 4.4 x 105 dpm/L). The application of this technology to radioactive liquid waste effluents would eliminate radioactivity from the source, in addition to reducing the volume of transuranic solid waste that is produced with the current treatment technologies. The hazard of pumping radioactive liquid waste to offsite facilities would also be eliminated because treatment of TA-55 effluent would occur prior to transportation.  28   NAFION Membrane Technolog y Membrane technology is now recognized as state-of-the-art for chloralkali chemical production, which constitutes the second largest commodity chemical volume produced globally. NAFION membranes are acknowledged as the world leader in bringing about a technology `revolution,' which has made the membrane electrolyzer system the technology of choice over the incumbent mercury amalgam cells and asbestos diaphragm electrolyzers. While significantly reducing the environmental impact of the old technologies, membrane systems confer the advantages of a new electrolysis process with lower investment and lower operating costs. Before NAFION and membrane technology, the production of chloralkali chemicals was dependent on either mercury amalgam cells or asbestos diaphragm systems. While these systems may be operated safely, they pose health and environmental concerns in use and disposal. Membranes, such as NAFION, now offer a more environmentally friendly and economically attractive alternative, which accounts for the rapid global adoption of membrane technology. Another rapidly emerging application of NAFION is in the area of alternative energy, where electricity is produced from the `combustionless burning' of hydrogen with oxygen in air via a membrane fuel cell. Fuel cell technology, with hydrogen as a fuel, is pollution-free. NAFION membranes often are cited in the many commercial developments of membrane fuel cell systems. As membrane fuel cells mature in the commercial mass market, more global energy needs will be served by renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly sources of power.  DuPont Company  Nalco Fuel Tech NOxOUT Process Nalco Fuel Tech develops and markets air pollution control technologies worldwide. Nalco Fuel Tech's flagship technology, NOxOUT, reduces harmful nitric oxide emissions of stationary combustion sources to yield nitrogen gas and water, leaving no disposal solids. The NOxOUT process meets today's environmental challenges by using less toxic chemistry, reducing or eliminating toxic releases to the environment, converting wastes to more environmentally acceptable discharges, and reducing energy consumption. The NOxOUT process provides an economical solution for complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for NOx reduction from fuel combustion sources. NOxOUT can reduce NOx emissions by 75 percent, compared to the 20 to 50 percent reduction from existing treatment. The NOxOUT process is being used commercially. It can be used on new combustion units for small industrial units to large utility installations or it can be retrofitted to existing units. The environmental benefits are significant NOx reduction, elimination of byproduct disposal, toxic use elimination of SARA Title III chemicals, and increased energy efficiency.  Nalco Fuel Tech  Nalco TRASAR Technolog y Nalco's TRASAR Technology is impacting the way the world manages water by helping customers reduce pollution at its source and conserve energy. These applications are a complete cradle-to-grave approach to water management. The initial process consists of adding low levels of inert fluorescent `trace' to Nalco's products. The trace allows controlled chemical application instantaneously and automatically. Chemical treatment reductions of 20 to 30 percent have resulted from this process. The second stage of the process consists of the direct, automatic detection of the treatment chemical. By fluorescent tagging of the treatment chemical, users can detect the chemical's presence in systems where low-level detection was not possible. This stage allows correlation to the variations in treatment consumption and to the variations in the water system's operation. The processes' final stage is based on the desired performance, such as corrosion protection or 29  Nalco Chemical Company   the prevention of foaming in the process system. Monitoring of the desired performance allows further chemical adjustment. This technology allows less consumption and more effective use of industrial process water, reduced chemical usage, energy conservation, the measurement of the fate of the chemical additives, the detection of industrial and biocide treatment for enhanced risk management, and the minimization of environmental release.  Nalco Chemical Company  Nalco ULTIMERTM Polymer Technolog y Industrial processes require water as a raw material or processing aid. This water must be treated to remove harmful waste and contamination prior to discharge to the environment. High molecular weight, water soluble polymers are used to accomplish the solid/liquid separation in industrial water and waste treatment applications. A class of polymers, known as polyacrylamides, performs this separation. In 1996, shipments of polyacrylamides in the United States exceeded 200 million pounds. The worldwide market is $1 billion. In 1995, Nalco continued its technological innovation by introducing to the marketplace the first major innovation in water treatment flocculants since the development of inverse emulsion polymers. These new ULTIMERTM polymers of high molecular weight polyacrylamides are environmentally responsible since they eliminate oils and surfactants yielding oil-free sludge. ULTIMERTM polymers contribute nearly zero volatile organic content as compared to oil emulsion polymers. This technology is more effective than existing technology and eliminates potential human health and environmental hazards in worldwide use. Toxic use reduction and pollution prevention are achieved by eliminating environmental discharges that present environmental hazards and by reducing the amount of solid waste disposed to landfills.  Rohm and Haas Company  A New Chemical Family of Insecticides Exemplified by CONFIRMTM Selective Caterpillar Control Agent and the Related Selective Insect Control Agents MACH 2TM and INTREPIDTM The value of crops destroyed worldwide by insects exceeds tens of billions of dollars. Over the past 50 years, only a handful of classes of insecticides have been discovered to combat this destruction. Rohm and Haas Company's invention of a new class of chemistry, the diacylhydrazines, is a significant new addition to the tools available to growers. Three members of this family have been or are in the process of being commercialized to date: CONFIRMTM, MACH 2TM, and INTREPIDTM. Not only are these materials effective in controlling target pests, but, in addition, they present the grower with significantly safer alternatives than those currently available. EPA recognized these unique features by classifying the first two members of this family as reduced risk pesticides. CONFIRMTM is a breakthrough in caterpillar control. It is chemically, biologically, and mechanistically novel. It effectively and selectively controls important caterpillar pests in agriculture without posing significant risk to the applicator, the consumer, or the ecosystem. It will replace many older, less effective, more hazardous insecticides. MACH 2TM is chemically and mechanistically related to CONFIRMTM, but, unlike CONFIRMTM, it is used to control an entirely different type of insect in an entirely different setting, namely turf grubs in soil. MACH 2TM is a low use rate product that is substantially safer to humans and to nontarget organisms (e.g., earthworms, birds, and fish) than other currently employed turf and lawn insecticides. INTREPIDTM is the newest member of the diacylhydrazine class. It shares all the desirable attributes of CONFIRMTM (i.e., extraordinary caterpillar selectivity as well as excellent safety to humans, nontarget organisms, and the ecosystem) and has the additional advantage of significantly greater caterpillar potency, which translates into a wider range of use. 30   A New Process for the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals In an effort to reduce the amount of waste generated at its East Hanover site, Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation has evaluated all site processes in order to make improvements in the utilization of solvents and minimize the waste byproduct while also improving operating efficiency. One process in particular was identified that appeared to offer significant opportunities for such process restructuring. After 2 years of research, all the essential elements of the new process have now been demonstrated. The new process uses a single new solvent for both reaction medium and separation, which significantly reduces the overall solvent requirements and permits recycling of the used solvent by simple distillation. As a result, the process waste index is reduced from the current 17.5 pounds of waste generated per pound of product to 1.5 pounds, resulting in a projected reduction of 170,000 pounds per year in waste generation. Furthermore, the amount of solvent used per batch is cut in half, thereby significantly reducing the usage of solvent with attendant lower risks of worker exposure and accidental releases to the environment. The decision to proceed with development of a new process, despite the potential problem of obtaining FDA approval of the process changes, is due primarily to the favorable economics of the new process. Conservative estimates of annual savings are around $775,000, compared to an investment of $2.1 million to develop and implement the new process, which is equivalent to a return on investment of 36.7 percent and less than a 3 year pay-back time. It is estimated that over 75 percent of the manufacturing savings are due to process improvements rather than disposal costs of unused solvent, illustrating the process optimization benefits characteristic for pollution prevention innovations.  Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation  No-Clean Soldering CTS Corporation Resistor Networks produces solid ceramic resistor networks in various single in-line, dual in-line, surface mount, and through-hole packages with standard or custom circuit designs. Through CTS Corporation's commitment to a responsible environmental policy, many of its manufacturing methods have been modified with the goal of reducing or eliminating hazardous waste byproducts. One such method to reduce waste was the implementation of a No-Clean soldering process. This No-Clean soldering process, which began in March of 1993, has eliminated the use of wave oil, soldering fluxes, and solvent cleaning. Changing to the No-Clean soldering process involved installing hoods over the solder pots. Using the hoods, an inert atmosphere is maintained over the molten solder. By using the inert atmosphere, oil and flux are no longer required. The parts are clean after solder and thus no solvent cleaning is needed. Previously, TCA (1-1-1 Trichloroethane) and TCE (1,1,2 Trichloroethylene) were used as part of a post-solder cleaning operation to remove flux and wave oil residues. Due to the elimination of flux and wave oil, these cleaning operations became unnecessary. Therefore, the amounts of waste TCA and TCE from soldering operations were reduced from 9,900 pounds and 226,000 pounds in 1992, respectively, to zero in 1995. As an added benefit of eliminating solventbased cleaning operations, air emissions due to the use of these chemicals have dramatically decreased. From 1992 through 1995, TCA and TCE related air emissions from soldering operations have been reduced from 99,000 pounds and 250,000 pounds, respectively, to zero. A cleaning operation, not related to soldering, generated a small amount of TCE air emissions in 1995. This operation was eliminated in June of 1995. The No-Clean soldering process has eliminated the generation of waste oil, flux, and cleaning solvents at the solder operation. Workers are no longer exposed to fumes from fluxes, oils, and cleaning solvents, which are typical of soldering operations. The product quality also has been improved.  CTS Corporation Resistor Networks  31   Technic, Inc. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  Noncyanide Silver Electroplating A proprietary, noncyanide silver electroplating process, Techni-Silver Cy-Less L, was developed by Technic. Cyanide based processes for electroplating have been extensively used in the United States for the last 50 years. Due to the hazardous nature of cyanide, extensive safety precautions must be incorporated when manufacturing electroplating chemicals, transporting the solutions to user sites, using the electroplating process, and disposing waste solutions. For example, if cyanide based solutions become too acidic, large amounts of poisonous cyanide gas are created. Historically, the electroplating industry has suffered many accidents due to the use of cyanide, which on a few occasions have resulted in death. Alternatives to cyanide-based solutions had been developed for all metals commercially electroplated except silver. The noncyanide silver electroplating process developed by Technic provides an alternative that is noticeably less toxic than the cyanide process and inherently safer with regard to accident potential. In addition, tests clearly show that the noncyanide formulation is capable of producing sound, thick (i.e., around 125 m) silver deposits that are extremely fine-grained and exhibit properties comparable to those produced in silver cyanide formulations. With the success of the noncyanide chemistry, Technic has made it possible to operate an entire plating facility without having to use any cyanide compounds.  DuPont Films  Petretecsm Polyester Regeneration Technolog y Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the fastest growing polymer. Becuase of their inherent thermal stability, PET-type thermoplastics lend themselves to direct recycling and serve as a raw material for the production of a number of products. For example, the success of PET bottle recycling is well known. This process annually diverts more than 600 million pounds of PET bottles per year from landfills. This technology requires waste with a high purity content and can only be used for carpeting or pillows. It usually cannot be reused to make new bottles. Additionally, there are a large number of uses for PET in which the material is dyed, coated, or mixed with a copolymer. The bulk of these materials are not suitable for direct recycling, so they are typically landfilled. However, the patented DuPont Petretecsm polyester regeneration technology provides an environmental alternative to landfills. The DuPont Petretecsm process unzips the PET molecule and breaks it down into its raw materials, dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG). The process allows the monomers to retain their original properties so they can be reused over and over again in any first-quality application. The process accepts polyester with a variety of contaminants at higher levels than other processes. The process reduces dependence on oil-derived feedstocks and diverts polyester from the solid waste stream. In the Petretecsm process, scrap PET reacts with methanol vapor at an elevated temperature (i.e., greater than 260 C) to produce a vapor stream of DMT, EG, and excess methanol. A glycol azeotroping agent, methyl p-toluate (MPT), is added, and the components are separated. Purification is accomplished by extensive fractional vacuum distillation. The products are then shipped back to PET fiber, film, and resin producers. Each kilogram of DMT made by the Petretecsm process reduces the demand for about 0.5 Kg of the traditional raw material known as paraxylene, an oil-derived basic petrochemical. The Petretecsm process is FDA approved and provides an economical way to reuse materials with higher contaminant levels than other recycling methods. DuPont converted its Cape Fear facility, near Wilmington, North Carolina, to a methanolysis plant. The new plant can handle more than 100 million pounds of scrap PET and 30 million pounds of EG annually, and is easily expandable.  32   Polycarbonate/Polydimethylsiloxane Copolymers for Thermal Print Media The process to make polycarbonates using bischloroformates and bisphenols or diols was developed and commercialized in the early 1990s by the Polymer Products Unit of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York. The original process to produce the polycarbonate of bisphenol A, diethylene glycol, and bisaminopropyl polydimethyl-siloxane was developed in 1992 and commercialized in 1993 for use in a new thermal print media product. Concerns over waste and air emissions, as well as cost and capacity issues, prompted a research and development effort to replace this polymer before production volumes increased to forecasted high levels. The new process to produce a similar polycarbonate/polydimethylsiloxane copolymer was certified early in 1994. Improvements include the following: (1) the new process is made in the solvent in which the polymer is coated, and is delivered to the manufacturing department dissolved in that solvent, eliminating the methanol precipitation, methanol washing, and vacuum drying steps; (2) in the new process, triethylamine is used as the acid acceptor instead of pyridine, making the water wash waste streams less hazardous; (3) the new process uses the commercially available diethylene glycol bischloroformate, eliminating the need to manufacture the bisphenol A bischloroformate at Kodak in Rochester (the bisphenol A bischloroformate synthesis uses phosgene as a key reactant, and its purification produces large quantities of hazardous waste containing heptane and silica gel). The new process will yield over 1.2 million pounds of hazardous waste reductions and more than 3,000 pounds of air emissions reductions from 1994 to year end 1996.  Eastman Kodak Company  PORTA-FEED Advanced Chemical Handling Systems During the 1980s, disposal of chemical residues and their containers was a potential human health and environmental risk for chemical users and the public. In 1985, Nalco developed the PORTA-FEED Advanced Chemical Handling system for chemical applications worldwide. It is the largest private fleet of returnable containers in the world at a capital cost of $220 million. These 101,000 units are owned, monitored, maintained, and cleaned by Nalco as a cradle-to-grave risk management process. The program consists of the units, a computerized tracking system, a zero defect delivery system, and a systematic maintenance and cleaning program. This pollution prevention program has prevented the disposal of more than 3 million drums and 30 million pounds of chemical waste. In 1985, 33 percent of Nalco's annual sales of $659 million were shipped in 500,000 nonreturnable drums. Seven percent of 1995 annual sales of $1.2 billion were shipped in nonreturnable drums. By the year 2000, Nalco expects to have eliminated the disposal concerns from 10 million drums and 100 million pounds of chemical waste worldwide. The system benefits are the reduction of human and environmental risk from transportation to disposal, reduced chemical inventory, and renewable resource implementation.  Nalco Chemical Company  The Production of Cumene with Zeolite Catalyst: Mobil/Badger Cumene Process Cumene is manufactured in very large volumes for subsequent conversion to phenol and acetone. The existing worldwide demand for cumene is about 7 million metric tons per year. The production of cumene by alkylation of benzene with propylene has, in the past, been carried out commercially over two catalyst systems: solid phosphoric acid (SPA) or aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Both SPA and AlCl3 present severe environmental problems; SPA catalyst is wet, corrosive, and might contain hydrocarbons, while waste AlCl3 is 33  Mobil Technology Company   a corrosive liquor that also might contain hydrocarbons. Both are classified as hazardous wastes. The Mobil/Badger Cumene process uses a new zeolite catalyst developed by Mobil, tested by Badger, and first commercialized in 1996. The environmental features of this process are many. The catalyst is environmentally inert, requires no special packaging or handling, and can be returned to Mobil at the end of its useful life. Very high yields are achieved; this results in less byproducts and waste streams and in reduced consumption of raw materials. Byproducts are LPG and a small residue stream useful as a high value fuel; neither presents an environmental hazard. High product purity results in improved yield and greater throughput in downstream phenol units, with lower production of byproducts and waste streams. Lower consumption of utilities leads to environmental improvement in their generation. Existing cumene facilities can, with retrofit, derive the environmental benefits of a new facility. By the middle of 1998, approximately 85 percent of the demand for cumene in the United States will be met by new and upgraded facilities using this technology.  DuPont Company  Reduction of Carbon Tetrachloride Emissions at the Source by the Development of a New Catalyst Phosgene is an important intermediate in the synthesis of polycarbonate plastics, high performance polymers, agrichemical intermediates, and urethane foams. Current global production is about 10 billion pounds per year. Although the process chemistry is selective, the byproduct carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is generated at a rate of 300 to 500 ppm, amounting to 5 million pounds per year globally. Since carbon tetrachloride is a carcinogen, an ozone depleting chemical, and a greenhouse gas, it was desirable to reduce or eliminate this undesirable byproduct. A DuPont team discovered a new catalyst that was produced in Siberia, Russia. After much laboratory work, it was decided to try a plant test, a scaleup of greater than 250,000 times. The catalyst was purchased, shipped from Siberia, and implemented in less than 1 year after the start of the program. After 1.5 years of commercial production, the new catalyst has consistently demonstrated high phosgene production rates and achieved a 90 percent reduction in the level of carbon tetrachloride generation (i.e., to less than 50 ppm, apparently a new global record). By conceptualizing, identifying, testing, securing from Russia, and implementing a novel phosgene production catalyst (well within the proposed 18 month deadline), the team saved the business a cost of $2 million associated with the installation of a new abatement furnace, which would have been the only other alternative. Furthermore, the resulting need for fewer catalyst changes in the reactor, as well as the prevention of maintenance costs that would have been associated with the abatement furnace, will save approximately an additional $400,000 per year. The catalyst technology is being offered for license globally, which could reduce emissions of CCl4 by up to 5 million pounds per year.  Monsanto Company  Roundup ReadyTM Technolog y Roundup ReadyTM technology is the mechanism by which crop selectivity to Roundup herbicide has been introduced into crop plants. Roundup, the world's largest selling herbicide, controls almost all weeds but shows little selectivity in crops. Roundup has excellent environmental characteristics and the active ingredient of glyphosphate has been given a category E status (evidence for not being a carcinogen) by EPA. The mode of action of the herbicide is also known precisely. A set of unique genes (Roundup ReadyTM) were discovered and introduced into crop plants to protect them from damage by the herbicide. Commercial launch began in 1996 with soybeans in the United States and will be followed by cotton and corn in 1997 to 1998. Current research and development programs will soon thereafter lead to commercialization in other oilseed crops, such as rape seed, and 34   in sugarbeet. Additional potential applications include wheat, rice, forestry, and vegetable and salad crops. Roundup ReadyTM Technology has changed the spectrum of herbicides used. Farmers who planted Roundup ReadyTM soybeans in 1996 reduced herbicide use by 10 to 35 percent with better weed control and generally did not use a preemergent or residual, post-emergent herbicide. Roundup herbicide has no `carry-over' in the soil, does not limit crop rotations, and is compatible with no-till crop production (a practice that is expanding in the United States and elsewhere). This technology extends to a wider aspect of agriculture and food production the ability to use one of the most beneficial and environmentally benign farm chemicals ever discovered.  Solvent Replacement and Improved Selectivity in Asymmetric Catalysis Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a substitute for organic solvents already represents an important tool for waste reduction in the chemical industry and related areas. Coffee decaffeination, hops extraction, and essential oil production as well as waste extraction/recycling, and a number of analytical procedures already use this nontoxic, nonflammable, renewable, and inexpensive compound as a solvent. The extension of this approach to chemical production, using CO2 as a reaction medium, is a promising approach to pollution prevention. Of the wide range supercritical carbon dioxide reactions that have been explored, one class of reactions has shown exceptional promise. Los Alamos National Laboratory has found that asymmetric catalytic reductions, particularly hydrogenations and hydrogen transfer reactions, can be carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide with selectivities comparable or superior to those observed in conventional organic solvents. Los Alamos has discovered, for example, that asymmetric hydrogen transfer reduction of enamides using ruthenium catalysts proceeds with enantioselectivities that exceed those in conventional solvents. The success of asymmetric catalytic reductions in CO2 is due in part to several unique properties of CO2 including tuneable solvent strength, gas miscibility, high diffusivity, and ease of separation. In addition, the insolubility of salts, a significant limitation of CO2 as a reaction solvent, has been overcome by using lipophilic anions, particularly tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate. These discoveries demonstrate an environmentally benign and potentially economically viable alternative for the synthesis of a wide range of specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Splittable Surfactants, A New Class of Surfactants Developed by Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide has developed a new class of surfactants, `Splittable Surfactants,' that will provide a substantial reduction in emulsified organics discharged in wastewater streams generated by a wide variety of industries. The new surfactants exhibit superior end use performance, as compared to current waste treatable surfactants and other proposed treatment schemes, which have not gained widespread use due to limitations in performance. Waste streams containing Union Carbide's `Splittable Surfactants' are quickly, easily, thoroughly, and irreversibly `split' and deactivated, via a chemical trigger, into nonsurface active components, allowing separation of the oily waste components from the water stream. A more concentrated oily waste is generated, facilitating incineration for fuel value and a highly biodegradable, essentially nontoxic water stream is discharged to treatment facilities. Before splitting and deactivation, `Splittable Surfactants' have an environmental profile comparable to conventional nonionic surfactants. Upon deactivation, both the hydrophilic 35  Union Carbide Corporation   and hydrophobic components biodegrade rapidly; the hydrophilic component that remains in the wastewater is essentially nontoxic to aquatic life. The Splittable Surfactant technology is the focus of the first industry partnership under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Technology Initiative for Chemicals.  Stepan Company  Stepan Company PA Lites Polyester Polyol Stepan Company's Polyester Polyol product, manufactured using the Phthalic Anhydride Process Light Ends (PA Lites), uses a previously categorized waste as a raw material in its manufacture, thereby eliminating the material's disposal via incineration. This Polyester Polyol is the basic raw material for the manufacture of various types of insulating wallboard used in the home construction and commercial building industry. By substituting traditional raw materials with PA Lites, Stepan Company is providing the construction industry and consumer with a cost effective alternative to traditional building construction products. Benefits from this product substitution go beyond the elimination of a waste requiring disposal. With its substitution as a raw material, it has reduced the requirement for phtalic anhydride, the traditional raw material for the polyol product, and the air emissions associated with its manufacture. As part of the development of this process, the distillation operation in the phtalic anhydride facility was also improved. An estimated 350 tons per year of organic waste material has been eliminated with the development and implementation of this technology. This not only represents a significant reduction in waste requiring disposal by incineration, but also the air emissions associated with these processes. Since this previously categorized waste material is now used on site to produce Polyester Polyol, potential exposure to the general public during offsite transportation to disposal facilities has been eliminated. This project resulted in two economic benefits. The first is the savings associated with the transportation and disposal via fuel blending for energy recovery. On an annual basis the expected savings is $200,000. The second economic benefit is the raw material savings due to the replacement of the Pure PA with the PA Lites material on a pound for pound basis. This results in additional savings of $20,000 annually.  Stepan Company  STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Polyurethane Foam HCFC-Free, Environmentally Friendly, Rigid Polyurethane Foam STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Polyurethane Foam is a product that replaces CFCs and HCFCs with water as the blowing agent in rigid polyurethane foam. Due to its unique and innovative chemistry, U.S. patent applications are pending for this product. Rigid polyurethane foam is a plastic material that provides a unique combination of insulation value and structural rigidity for common products such as picnic coolers, entry doors, and water heaters. Historically, polyurethane foams used in insulating applications incorporated trichlorofluoroethane (CFC-11) as the blowing agent. However, CFCs, such as trichlorofluoroethane, have been demonstrated to play a large role in the chemical destruction of Earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which acts as a filter for harmful ultraviolet radiation. Today, most polyurethane foams have replaced trichlorofluoroethane with HCFC-141b as the blowing agent. Although it has an ozone depletion potential that is lower than that of CFC-11, HCFC-141b is also considered an ozone-depleter. The Stepan Company has remained committed to addressing these issues through the development of a lower cost, technologically advanced polyurethane foam, which replaces environmentally unfriendly and potentially hazardous blowing agents with water. STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Foam eliminates emissions of CFCs and HCFCs into the environment; it 36   ultimately reduces the mass of solid waste requiring disposal, and it offers a safer alternative blowing agent than other technologies are currently offering. The final, and perhaps most important, property considered in the development of STEPANFOAM WaterBlown Foam as an alternative to HCFC-blown products is its insulative capacity. Outstanding flow characteristics, combined with a fine cellular structure, maximize the insulation capability of STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Foam. At the same core density, the physical properties of the two systems are nearly identical. By replacing CFC and HCFC with water in its formulations, Stephan has eliminated its use of as much as 2 million pounds per year of CFCs and will eliminate as much as 1 million pounds per year of HCFCs.  Synerg y CCSTM Precision Cleaning Solvent: A Government/Industry Solution to a Complex Environmental Problem Synergy CCSTM had its beginnings at the Department of Energy's Kansas City Plant (managed and operated by AlliedSignal Inc.) when the plant began an effort focused on the elimination of toxic, restricted, or environmentally damaging solvents. Experience derived from this solvent substitution and elimination effort proved beneficial when, through its Technology Transfer Program, Kansas City Plant personnel were asked for help by a small manufacturer needing a safe, one-step cleaning solvent. Synergy CCSTM Precision Cleaning Agent was formulated to meet this need. Synergy CCSTM is a blend of environmentally derived products that forms a safe, powerful, yet distillable precision cleaning solvent capable of being heavily loaded with contaminants. Synergy CCSTM is comprised of natural components that have been in industrial use for over 45 years: dlimoene, a solvent derived from citrus byproducts, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, a solvent produced from the waste products of corn, oats, and sugar production. Individually, these materials are already used for cleaners, paint stripping formulations, and agricultural applications. The solvent was further developed and adopted by a HewlettPackard Co. division, patented, and licensed to Petroferm, Inc., a worldwide leader in sales and technical support for alternative solvents and cleaning technologies. This partnership demonstrates how government and private industry can work together to develop safe chemical alternatives to solve environmental problems while simultaneously improving America's industrial competitiveness.  Allied Signal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies  Use of Carbon Dioxide as an Alternative Green Solvent for the Synthesis of Energetic Thermoplastic Elastomers Thermoplastic elastomers based on triblock oxetane copolymers containing azido functional groups offer an improved binding material for solid, high-energy formulations. Current technology uses chemically cross-linked energetic prepolymer mixes that introduce the problems of thermally labile chemical linkages, high end-of-mix viscosities, and vulnerability to premature detonation. These materials are also nonrecyclable and generate large amounts of pollution during disposal. The use of energetic thermoplastic elastomers eliminates the need for chemical cross-linking agents, makes processing easier due to their low melt viscosities, and eliminates the need for solvents during casting. Their superior processing qualities and the ease of demilitarization and recycling make these materials a much more environmentally sound choice for energetic binders. However, their synthesis still involves the use of large quantities of toxic chemicals, such as methylene chloride, as solvents. Carbon dioxide has been proven to be a viable, environmentally responsible replacement solvent for many synthetic and processing applications. It is cheap, easily recy37  U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research U.S. Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center Aerojet Propulsion Professor Joseph M. DeSimone, Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill   clable, and available from current sources. Research at the University of North Carolina has shown that carbon dioxide is a viable solvent for the polymerization of vinyl ether monomers. Furthermore, polyoxetanes can be polymerized in carbon dioxide with molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and functionality maintained. The University of North Carolina has demonstrated the synthesis of both nonenergetic and energetic homopolymers and random copolymers.  Alliance for Environmental Technology (AET)  The Use of Chloride Oxide, the Foundation of Elemental Chlorine-Free (ECF) Bleaching for Pulp and Paper, as a Pollution Prevention Process The use of chlorine dioxide as a pollution prevention process to substantially or completely replace chlorine in the first stage of chemical pulp bleaching is a unique implementation of chlorine dioxide chemistry. It can be applied to the entire bleached chemical pulp and paper industry, both in the United States and abroad. By employing raw material substitution and process modifications, this technology has allowed the pulp and paper industry to meet the source reduction objectives of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. With this new application of sophisticated chlorine dioxide chemistry, the pulp and paper industry virtually eliminated dioxin from mill waste waters and our nation's water bodies. This technology has answered the industry's calls for a more benign chemical pulp bleaching agent. Virtual elimination of dioxin from mill waste waters and continuing nationwide ecosystem recovery provide a strong measure of chlorine dioxide's success and the industry's environmental progress. In fact, downstream of U.S. pulp mills bleaching with chlorine dioxide, fish dioxin body burdens have declined rapidly and aquatic ecosystems continue to recover. For example, the Mead Paper Company's Escanaba Mill, in Michigan, implemented pollution prevention strategies beginning with the use of low precursor defoamers in 1989. In 1990, the mill increased chlorine dioxide substitution. These process modifications decreased dioxin in final mill effluent to nondetectable levels. Consequently, dioxin body burdens declined more than 90 percent in less than 4 years. These indicators of progress toward broader ecosystem integrity demonstrate the success of chlorine dioxide as `green chemistry.'  U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research U.S. Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center Los Alamos National Laboratory Aerojet  Waste Reduction in the Production of an Energetic Material by Development of an Alternative Synthesis 1,3,3-Trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) is a promising new melt-castable explosive that has significant potential for providing environmental benefits and capability improvements in a wide variety of defense and industrial applications. Initial lifecycle inventories on various munitions revealed that up to 50 percent of the lifecycle pollution burden was associated with the demilitarization of the munitions, and in particular, the use of thermoset polymeric binders that require removal with water jet cutting. TNAZ is the only energetic material other than trinitrotoluene (TNT) that can be melt-cast in existing TNT loading plants. Demilitarization of TNAZ simply requires heating the device above the melting point and pouring the liquid out, rather than the complicated and destructive methods used for RDX- and HMX-based plastic-bonded explosives. The stability of TNAZ in the melt allows it to be easily recycled. TNAZ has performance slightly better than that of HMX, the most powerful military explosive in current use. Thus, TNAZ may offer 30 to 40 percent improvements in performance as a replacement for TNT-based formulations such as Composition-B. The alternative synthesis of TNAZ, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, allows TNAZ to be produced in a waste-free process that also eliminates the use of halogenated solvents. This alternative synthesis produces 5.3 pounds of 38   waste per pound of product compared to the original synthesis of TNAZ, which produces 1,200 pounds of waste per pound of product. The alternate technology has been transferred to industry, where it has been scaled up to production-plant quantities. Further improvements in waste reduction have been demonstrated in the laboratory that may eventually lead to a process giving little more waste than one pound of salt per pound of TNAZ.  Water-Dispersible Hot-Melt Adhesive Raw Material Current technologies make recycling and disposal of paper products difficult. The hotmelt adhesive industry has been searching for an answer in the form of a water-dispersible raw material. Previous attempts to satisfy this need were often deficient in both critical performance requirements and cost. Government regulations are not yet directly mandating improved adhesive raw materials, but the needs are real and urgent just the same. The lack of regulatory changes does not encourage adhesive manufacturers to introduce products based on expensive raw materials. Eastman AQ 1350 water-dispersible hot-melt adhesive raw material represents the best of both worlds. The water dispersibility of Eastman AQ 1350 is due to the random incorporation of sodiosulfonate groups along with polymer backbone. These ionic functionalities also facilitate the excellent adhesion of Eastman AQ 1350 to a variety of substrates. Some of the key features of Eastman's new product are low cost, 100 percent water-dispersible in ordinary tap water, nondispersible in ionic solutions, superior adhesion to polyolefin films, and comparable key physical properties to conventional formulations. Eastman AQ 1350 is part of a new family of water-dispersible polymers that provide the hot-melt adhesive industry with an innovation that addresses long-standing needs in very large, applicable areas. These products not only overcome the lack of water-dispersibility inherent to the current generation of technology but also are differentiated from the competitive generation of technologies by their ability to be dispersed into water coupled with insolubility in saline solutions. This tunable solubility mechanism also can be employed as a method for product recovery; thus, it is legitimate to call Eastman AQ 1350 an advanced technology of a `smart material.'  Eastman Chemical Company  West Fork Biotreatment Project Asarco has developed a biotreatment system for removing metals from mine water prior to its discharge to the waters of the state. Asarco owns and operates two lead mines and a lead smelter and refinery in southeast Missouri. Recent changes in the Water Quality Standards required Asarco to explore water treatment alternatives. One of the alternatives considered was biotreatment. Preliminary results from a tank test and proof-of-principle test conducted in 1993, were very encouraging and plans were made for a scale size operation to be built. In early 1994 a pilot plant biocell was constructed and filled with a substrate mixture of sawdust from an abandoned sawmill, alfalfa hay, cow manure from a dairy, mine tailings, and lime rock. All material used was acquired locally. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) were cultivated within the anaerobic environment of the substrate. SRB are abundant in nature and are found predominantly in bogs and swamps. The SRB produce hydrogen sulfide gas as a byproduct that acts as a sulfiding agent to precipitate the dissolved metals from the mine water. The system also removes significant amounts of nitrates. The pilot plant reduced metals to below the Water Quality Standards set by the State of Missouri for protection of aquatic life. Different operation scenarios were implemented to explore the limits of the system. For 2 years, through extremes of ambient temperature, water flow rates, and metals loadings, the biotreatment system operated efficiently. The system reverses the process which put the lead in the dissolved form and returns it to a lead sulfide (PbS), an original inert form of lead ore. The PbS remains in the substrate for the life of the plant which is estimated, based on carbon consumption, to be in excess of 30 39  Asarco Incorporated   years. No chemicals were used, therefore, no chemicals must be transported on highways at risk of spilling. No daily sludges are generated that have to be disposed of in landfills, and water quality is improved. Construction of a full-scale plant was completed in July 1996. Start-up was completed in November and the full-scale plant is currently treating 1,500 GPM and is allowing West Fork Mine to comply with the NPDES permit limits.  40   Index Award winners are indicated with *. *Albright & Wilson Americas  THPS Biocides: A New Class of Antimicrobial Chemistry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Alliance for Environmental Technology (AET)  The Use of Chlorine Oxide, the Foundation of Elemental Chlorine-Free (ECF) Bleaching for Pulp and Paper, as a Pollution Prevention Process . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 Allied Signal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies  Synerg y CCSTM Precision Cleaning Solvent: A Government/Industry Solution to a Complex Environmental Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 Altus Biologics Inc.

GX267-89-4895943	"simulations suggest that such a scheme can control exhaustion of dyes in a multiple component dyebath. Our current dyeing equipment has been modified to allow dosing of dyes and/or chemicals into the dyebath using a computer-controlled peristaltic pump. The software necessary to drive the pump was written and tested. The first system to be examined involving dosing to control the dyeing process is the dyeing of polyamide fibers with acid dyes. In addition, a new generation data acquisition system, based on industry standards, is under development, and should be online by November. This system should greatly enhance our ability to acquire and store dye-bath data. Additionally, the following hardware was purchased: 80486 based PC to control a UV-Visible spectrophotometer, a computer controllable piston pump, and a pH meter which is temperature and conductivity compensated. Technical Papers and Other Communications  Synthetic Dyes Based on Toxicological Considerations Principal Investigator: s92c2  H. S. Freeman (NC State) Objectives:  The goals outlined in the 3-year study proposed last year remain essentially intact. They are: 1) Characterization of the mechanisms of genotoxicity of hydrophobic azo dyes; 2) Synthesis and evaluation of novel metalized acid, direct, and fiber-reactive dyes; 3) Environmentally safe routes to azo dyes based on heteroaromatic amines; 4) Synthesis of azo dyes from the wastes of other reactions; 5) Improvements in the yields of coupling components for disperse dyes; and 6) Well-trained dye chemists. In addition, we intend to pursue the development of a patent application to protect the novel, lightfast black metal (Fe) complexes discovered so far in this investigation. Since the dyes developed to this point appear to be more appropriate for wool than nylon, ""environmentally friendly"" metal complexes for nylon will also be designed. The novel Fe complexes already made will also be evaluated on leather, to follow through on a suggestion by Mr. Abe Riefe (industrialist on this project). Summary:  The following papers have been submitted, presented or published during this reporting quarter to add to the numerous publications and presentations from previous quarters: l W. Jasper, E.

It is clear from the reports we received so far that perspiration fastness was good and lightfastness was especially good. Of concern was the low water solubility of the dyes and their fastness/stability to acidic media. Interestingly, both dyes continue to be of Natimal Textile Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993   interest, as one seems preferable on nylon while the other is better on leather. In the meantime, we have synthesized an analog of these dyes that possesses improved water solubility, and will be evaluating its fastness properties soon. In recent weeks, we elected to turn our attention to a family of less commonly used complex-forming monoazo dyes as targets for the synthesis of new I:2 Iron complexes. The result has been the formation of blue and violet colors for nylon and wool, in addition to brown and black shades. Needless to say, this is an exciting and quite promising turn of events. We are planning to synthesize a group of mixed complexes, with the goal of fine tuning some of the present shades. Obviously, the next step is to assess the fastness properties of this new family of dyes. The results of this determination will be outlined in our next report. Preliminary results from the mutagenicity testing of the metallized dyes prepared so far indicate that the Fe complexes are either non-mutagenic or significantly less mutagenic than both the corresponding Co and Cr analogs and the unmetallized precursors. Laura will have more definitive results for the next report.

Moser, B. Smith (NC State); W. Perkins (Auburn) [reported by Mike Cato] Objective:  1. Characterize basic dielectric infrared and ultrasound properties of textile material for a database to be used to develop these energy sources in fiber, textile, and apparel manufacturing. 2. Develop textile processing utilizing electrotechnologies for improvement in productivity and environmental safety; includes IR absorption studies; dielectric properties studies; RF fixation mechanisms; and ultrasonic dyeing. 3. Develop economic analysis of existing energy intensive manufacturing technologies; expansion of existing energy models to include economic analysis; develop non-traditional economic models (multiattribute decision) of electrotechnologies. 4. Develop new processing techniques such as an accelerated process for dyeing short runs of polyester/cotton fabric. Develop a process to quickly and economically dye short runs of polyester/cotton blend fabrics; process based on radio frequency energy. 5. Develop entirely new processes using combinations of electrotechnologies such as ultrasonic dyeing and RF drying. Summary:  We completed our investigation of the utility of FeCl, as a coagulant for the removal of phosphate ions from disperse dye wastewater. Using filtrates derived from the synthesis of Disperse Red 177, we found that phosphate removal at a level of 99.999+% can be achieved when an Fe:P ratio of 2: 1 is used. This means that either Alum or FeCl, can be used as long as the proper pH is employed. For Alum the pH should be 5-6, and for the pH should be 3-4. In the coming months we will conclude the present aspect of our work in this area with a determination of the utility of the collected phosphate as a component for commercial fertilizers. This is envisioned as an alternative to either incineration or landfilling the coagulants. Technical Papers and Other Communications  A manuscript entitled ""Premetallized Acid Dyes Based on Environmental Considerations"" has been prepared for the Book of Papers for the upcoming AATCC International Conference (October, 1993). This paper outlines the results to be presented during the conference delivery, and focuses on the fastness properties and genotoxicity of the black Fe complexes synthesized as potential non-chromium alternatives to commercial premetallized acid black dyes containing Cr. The manuscript mentioned in our last report as having been submitted to Textile Research Journal has been reviewed, and was found acceptable pending our consideration of 3 points. These were handled by us immediately, and the editor has sent the revised manuscript to the reviewer for final consideration.  Joint research involving all three universities is being done to determine the effects of washing efficiency on dielectric properties and RF drying of yarn packages. Warren Perkins has determined common residuals in bleached and dyed yarn packages. With Warren's recommendations, experiments are being designed and conducted at Georgia Tech using a network analyzer which measures the dielectric properties of materials. Different solutions typically found in textile dyeing have been prepared and analyzed to determine their dielectric properties. Different types of salt had significantly different loss factors. Data is being analyzed and a final report will be compiled within two months. NC State is planning to use the information learned at Georgia Tech to design pilot plant drying studies. To better understand the network analyzer, Mike Cato, from NC State, worked at Georgia Tech for a day.  National Textib Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993  23"

Analysis is now in progress on the toxicity of these three dyes after they have been decolorized by ozone. In another experiment, the toxicities of Cu"" in ionic form and Drimarene Turquoise K2B (a copper phthalocyanine type reactive dye) were determined. Toxicity tests were done on the dye before ozonation and after ozonation to various degrees of color removal. The EC,, toxicity of Cu'* for Lemna Minor was 2.8 ppm. Approximately 90 ppm of dye contains 2.8 ppm of copper. The results of the toxicity tests for the dye were as follows: Ozonation Time Light Transmittance Toxicity (Min) 0 48 80 105 (%) 50 77 95+ EC, mgn 422 103 93 89  40 20 100 120 140  0  20  40  60  60  Time of Treatment (minutes) - 1 g/l peroxids;SW-UV  Removal of Dyes Electrochemically from Reactive Dyeing Wastewater: Researchers at Georgia Tech continued studies  in this area. Removal of color by the electrochemical process has been completed for the four reactive dyes selected for study. The color removal is more rapid than expected based on work on other dye classes. Color in some cases was 100% removed at only 50 ppm of iron addition. Similar results have been obtained in three separate experiments so the rapid removal appears to be real. The electrochemical process may prove to be very efficient in removing reactive dyes. The reasons for this rapid decolorization of reactive dyes is now Reactive dyes can be re~f;~~e~.

Continuous Bleaching of Cotton Process Automation and Reuse of Bleaching Waste Water for Fabric Scouring: The laboratory filtration unit at Clemson has been assembled and the baseline data collected on tap and deionized (DI) water to determine the filtration characteristics of the microtilter. Laboratory experiments are currently being conducted at Clemson to determine the type of filtration that will be needed to make the bleaching wastewater suitable for recycle. This data will be compared to plant data taken from full scale operation. Additional samples of the bleaching and scouring wastewater continue to be taken for wastewater characterization. Bleaching formulation data continues to be gathered so it will be available if it becomes necessary to make modifications to the plant formulation to make it compatible with the conditions of the scouring process from a reuse perspective. The selection of the software for simulating the bleaching and scouring process and for modeling the recycle process is underway and should be completed during the next quarter. The engineering plans have been developed for the full scale plant scale recycling system and plans have been made for its installation early in the next quarter. In addition, the process design changes for both the Open Width Preparation Range and the Combination Open & Rope Preparation Ranges in 27  lyzer for complex dye mixtures. The computer interface has been programmed and is operational. The light source was damaged in transit and had to be returned to the manufacturer. It has been repaired and has been received. Moditications to the fiber optic cable system had to be made to interface with the dual beam flow cell. These modifications are underway. Initial evaluations on the unit are planned for next quarter. Metals Removal and Toxicity Studies-  A study was conducted to determine the toxicity of three vinyl sulfone type reactive dyes to Lemna Minor (duckweed). The results were expressed as EC,, values. The EC,, value is the concentration of dye which inhibits growth of Lemna Minor to 50% of that of controls without dye in a seven day period. The higher the EC,, value, the less toxic the material is. The following results were obtained.

Develop and evaluate dyes that require less salt for application and optimized dyeing 1 procedures for existing dyes. The initial work was proposed at a cost of over $200,000. Due to budget limitations, two of these areas, trace impurity analysis (#3) and color removal (#4), were chosen as project initiation tasks. The remaining projects were deferred until later. Summary: Decolorization of Waste Water  fort during this quarter has been directed toward understanding the differences between the commercial scale trials on hydrogen peroxide bleaching of hosiery and the laboratory experiments. Several possible sources of difference have been ruled out by subsequent experiments. Differences in water between the lab and the plant and differences in the addition of optical brightener do not appear to be the sources of the different results. Level of sodium hydroxide and temperature differences are now under investigation. A number of new surfactants have been investigated this quarter in an attempt to find a substitute for the ethoxylated phenol in the current recipe. It was surprising to find that none of the alternatives give whiteness values as high as the current surfactant. Several other candidates will be investigated next quarter as the surfactant is clearly a key ingredient in the whiteness level that is obtainable. Technical Papers and Other Communications l  A sorption unit that utilizes chitin and chitosan was built and tested in the previous quarter. This quarter considerable data was collected on a number of dyestuffs. In particular a number of studies on Acid Red 1 dye were obtained. The decolorization unit consists of four chambers that can be independently operated or with the others in series or parallel flow. Each chamber can accommodate approximately 1 liter of absorbent or approximately 100 grams of chitin. The unit has been successmlly tested up to a flow rate of 900 mL/min and pressures of up to 22 psi. Nine different dyes were tested on the sorption unit using chitosan as an adsorbent. These dyes were: Acid Red 1, Acid Blue 25, Acid Blue 193, Mordant Black 17, Direct 81, Direct Blue 86, Direct Green 26, Reactive Red 120, and Reactive Violet 5. As noted above Acid Red 1 was used for a number of different studies, For all of the above isotherms were obtained. A monolayer capacity of Acid Red 1 dye onto chitosan was found to be as high as 242.6 g per kilogram of chitosan. A surprising result was the discovery of an ""overdyeing effect"" for Acid Red 1. Overdyeing is the unexpected sorption of ionic dyes onto a substrate beyond what is expected for a langmuir type isotherm. This unexpected feature of chitosan has not been reported before. Future studies will exploit this observation and is expected to lead to a more fundamental insight on the sorption of ionic dyes onto ionic polymers. Detection of Trace Toxic Impurities in High Volume Raw Materials  l  A paper on Decolorization of Continuous Dyeing Wastewater by Ozonation was accepted for publication by Textile Chemist and Colorist. A paper on the new hosiery bleaching system was presented at the annual Institute of Textile Technology TAC meeting in April. A Master's thesis on this system will be issued next quarter.  Wastewater Decolorization using Chitin and Detection of Trace Toxic Impurities in High Volume Raw Material Principal Investigators: SQZCl  C.D. Livengood, C. Smith, S. M. Hudson (NC State) Objectives:  Long term four major areas of work were initially proposed last year. 1. Develop a simple comparative rating system for assessing treatability of textile chemicals and waste streams. 2. Develop improved methods of identifying/reducing specific pollutant sources (e.g. textile dyes, chemicals and processes.) 3. Identify offensive trace impurities in high value raw materials (dyes, salt, water, alkali, fiber). 4. Develop and evaluate color measurement and chitosan sorption treatment systems for textile wastewater.  The primary goal of this quarter was to complete the pretrial C.O.D. and B.O.D. experiments, so that fiber samples can be run routinely. This task was accomplished. The main task was to determine the concentration of the fiber sample in order to apply the appropriate standard C.O.D. range for the C.O.D. reactor digestor method. B.O.D. can not be run unless the C.O.D. experiment is finalized in order to determine the correct concentration level to be applied in the B.O.D. experiment.  28  Natinnal 7-extile Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993"

PLA is a new biodegradable plastic that’s derived from corn and replaces nonrenewable fossil raw materials. This culminates years of R&D by Cargill and others whose efforts were supported by the  Agriculture  Team, as well as other parts of DOE and other Federal agencies. The PLA market could eventually exceed 8 billion lb/year–saving 190 trillion Btu of energy. “PLA represents one of the single largest impacts we have in the Agriculture Team on energy savings,” said Team Leader Mark Paster (202-586-2821).                      Succinic acid is another plant-based raw material that could compete with fossil fuel-derived feedstocks used to manufacture paints, plastics and other products. High production cost has kept succinic acid from being widely used. “But we’ve had incremental successes in this area for several years and two recent R&D projects have forwarded technology to the point where succinic acid is financially attractive,” said Paster. He expects commercial-scale production of lower cost succinic acid to soon begin.                     A “Clean Fractionation” project co-supported by OIT’s  Agriculture  and  Chemical  Teams is being scaled up to pilot stage. The technology enables manufacture of high purity cellulose using significantly less energy than incumbent processes. Projected potential energy savings are 13 trillion Btu/year by 2020.                                           Chemicals Turning waste carpeting into commercial raw materials            The Chemicals Team is proud of its “pipeline of successful projects moving toward commercialization,” said Team Leader Paul Scheihing (202-586-7234). One commercial success is the “Nylon 6 Recycling” project, which recently earned both the Society of Plastic Engineers “Recycler of the Year,” and The Design for Humanity Award. Honeywell and DSM Chemicals use the technology at their Evergreen Nylon Recycling plant in Augusta, GA—the largest commercial-scale nylon recycling plant in the world. The plant can convert waste carpeting back to virgin-quality monomers keeping an estimated 200 million pounds of carpet out of landfills, annually, and saving 4.4 trillion Btu.                      About to enter the pilot stage is another Team-sponsored technology, “Catalytic Hydrogenation Retrofit Reactor.” It improves the commonly-used hydrogenation process by replacing a slurry catalyst system with a monolith catalyst reactor. The new process uses less energy and reduces environmental and safety concerns of the incumbent method.                     The Team is also supporting the Multi-Phase Fluid Dynamics Research Consortium which brings together the country’s leading chemical companies, engineering universities and DOE Labs in an unprecedented partnership. The group is developing new techniques that will lead to better understanding of gas-solid flow. This will lead to improved chemical process yields and provide very large energy savings due to the widespread prevalence of gas-solid flow in the chemical industry.                                           Forest Products Burning sludge without NOx emissions           Forest Products  Team Leader Valri Robinson (202-586-0937) identified three especially promising technologies recently supported by the Team that are now being demonstrated at partner facilities. “Perhaps the most successful is the ‘Methane de-NOx Reburning Process’ being demonstrated at a Boise Cascade (BC) plant,” she said. “Natural gas is injected into the combustion zone to create an oxygen-deficient environment that reduces NOx formation. Mills are interested because it could allow disposal of sludge by burning rather than landfilling without increasing emissions. BC reports they can burn 400% more sludge than before, while maintaining NOx levels. Other benefits include a reduction in overall gas use and an increase in boiler efficiency, saving nearly $700,000/year on equipment that costs just $400,000 to install.”                     In another demonstration at a Visy Paper facility in Georgia, mechanical rather than chemical means are employed to detackify “stickies” that lead to excessive costs and downtime for recycling mills. The new process reduces the cost of chemicals and their environmental impacts, and could save more than 1 billion kWh/year.           Another successful technology, “On-line Fluidics Controlled Headbox,” is being demonstrated at a Smurfit-Stone mill in Florence, SC. It allows a mill to process 10-15% less fiber per sheet which could save up to 60 trillion Btu/year by 2020.                                           Aluminum Revolutionizing the way aluminum is made            The  Aluminum  Team is partnering with Northwest Aluminum Co. on a project that will change the way aluminum is made and could reduce the energy required for smelting by 25-30%. The process uses a new cell design with a non-consumable inert metal anode to produce aluminum. It has lower energy intensity, lower cost and lower environmental impacts than the traditional Hall – Heroult technology.                      Another team project, led by Secat, Inc., addresses the oxidative melt problem that accounts for a loss of up to 4% of secondary aluminum during the melting process. “This project is a model partnership, bringing together representatives from industry, universities and DOE Labs,” said Aluminum Team Leader Sara Dillich (202-586-7925). “It will help solve a long-standing plant floor problem while enhancing our understanding of the oxidation process. Best of all, it will reduce energy losses by up to 50%.”                     In a partnership with DOE’s Office of Transportation Technologies and the auto and aluminum industries, the Team is championing an “Automotive Aluminum Scrap Sorting” technology that will likely achieve fast commercialization. Using laser induced spectroscopy, the new process will allow rapid separation of cast and wrought aluminum and aluminum alloys, thereby facilitating the use of recycled rather than primary metal.                                           Steel New electronic technologies saving energy in demanding steel environments            A  Steel  Team project is developing a model to better control pre-heated air in blast furnaces. The model will allow tighter control over temperature and flow rates thereby reducing fuel use. Overcoming a number of obstacles, the project partners began using the model on a blast furnace at Inland Steel where natural gas use was subsequently cut by about 7%. The model is now being used on all three of the mill’s blast furnaces.                      An electric arc furnace optical sensor developed in a Team partnership was recently proven successful in a prototype trial at The Timken Company’s Faircrest Steel Plant in Canton, OH. The laser-based system measures the composition of gases exiting a steel-melting furnace, facilitating real-time process control. Timken projects a 10% improvement in productivity and a 2% increase in energy efficiency. An extended trial is now underway.                     A third project is helping more accurately control the properties of hot rolled steel, yielding a more refined product with less variability. In use at several AISI-member mills, the hot strip mill model runs on a PC, and has shown the ability to reliably correlate operating parameters to resulting properties of hot rolled steel.                     “These three successes provide a broad spectrum of value to the steel industry,” said OIT’s new Steel Team Leader Isaac Chan (202-586-4981). “They help save energy in an integrated steel mill, in electric arc steelmaking, and downstream in the rolling area.”                                           Metal Casting Doubling of steel die lifetimes sought            “The Metal Casting Team’s R&D portfolio has been making important contributions to industry-identified roadmap priorities and OIT’s energy efficiency goals,” said Team Leader Harvey Wong (202-586-9235). One project led by The Materials Technology Laboratory is helping industry to better understand copper alloys. It has created the first-ever comprehensive database on these materials, and details the mechanical, fracture toughness, impact, and fatigue properties of 13 copper alloys. Use of this information is expected to contribute to processing efficiencies saving 1.2 trillion Btu and reducing CO2 emissions by 120,000 tons.                     Led by the Univ. Alabama/Birmingham, “Lost Foam Casting,” is improving process controls for this casting method. It offers significant cost and environmental advantages, and enables metal casters to produce complex parts that are often not possible using other methods. Compared to traditional green sand or resin-bonded sand molding methods, potential energy savings of “lost foam” amount to about 27% (4.7 trillion Btu/year by 2020) with a 46% improvement in labor productivity. The Team’s work has made lost foam a practical reality, and its use is increasing by as much as 20% per year.                     Steel dies can take months to manufacture and cost over $1 million. Moreover, die testing and manufacturing can be energy intensive. A team led by Case Western Reserve Univ. is identifying composition and processing techniques that lead to improved thermal fatigue resistance, increased die           life and reduced die cost. Die life improvements of 50-100% have been seen, resulting in considerable energy savings.
