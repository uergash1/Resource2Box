S. Elections 2000)                                 Heute gibt es in den            Vereingten Staaten    zwei große            politische Parteien, die ""Demokraten"" und die ""Republikaner"".                        Die ""Demokratische Partei"" entwickelte sich aus der Partei Thomas            Jeffersons, die schon vor 1800 gegründet wurde. Die ""Republikanische            Partei"" wurde 1850 von Abraham Lincoln und anderen Gegnern der Ausweitung            der Sklaverei gegründet.                         Die Demokraten werden als die liberalere Partei angesehen und die Republikaner            als die eher konservative Partei. Demokraten glauben im allgemeinen, dass            die Regierung verpflichtet sei, soziale und wirtschaftliche Programme für            die Bedürftigen             bereitzustellen. Republikaner sind nicht            unbedingt gegen solche Programme, glauben aber, dass sie den Steuerzahler            zu viel kosten. Sie legen mehr Wert darauf, private Investitionen zu fördern,            in der Hoffnung, dass eine starke Privatwirtschaft die Bürger weniger            abhängig vom Staat macht.                         Beide grossen Parteien bekommen eine            Menge Unterstützung von einer Vielfalt von Amerikanern und vereinen            eine weitreichende Skala politischer Ansichten. Amerikaner müssen nicht            Parteimitglied sein, um zu wäehlen oder um selbst für ein Amt            zu kandidieren, aber es ist schwierig, sich für ein Amt zu bewerben            ohne das Geld und die freiwilligen Wahlhelfer, die eine Partei bereitstellt.                         Nach den Wahlen            1998 gab es nur einen einzigen Abgeordneten im Kongress, der als Unabhängiger            gewählt worden war, und nur 20 (0.003 %) der mehr als 7300 gewählten            Abgeordneten in den einzelstaatlichen Parlamenten waren weder Republikaner            noch Demokraten. Es sind diese zwei grossen Parteien, die die Regierungen            sowohl auf nationaler als auch auf einzelstaatlicher Ebene stellen.

Juni 1777. Die Resolution lautet:                        ""Es sei beschlossen, dass die Flagge der Vereinigten Staaten dreizehn            Streifen, abwechselnd rot und weiss, haben soll; dass die Union dreizehn            Sterne, weiss auf einem blauen Feld, eine neue Konstellation sein sollen.""                        Die Resolution gab keinen Hinweis darauf, wieviele Zacken die Sterne haben            sollten noch wie die Sterne auf dem blauen Hintergrund angeordnet werden            sollten. Darausfolgend ergaben sich viele verschiedene Variationen. Während            des Unabhängigkeitskrieges stellten mehrere Patrioten Flaggen für            die neue Nation her. Betsy Ross ist die bekannteste unter ihnen, aber es            gibt keinen Beweis, dass sie wirklich die erste Fahne herstellte.                        Erst am 4. April 1818 stimmte Präsident Monroe einem Gesetzesvorschlag            zu, in dem festgelegt wurde, wie das Grunddesign der Flagge sein muss, damit            die Vergrößerung des Landes angemessen symbolisiert würde.            Es erforderte, dass die Flagge der Vereinigten Staaten eine Einheit von            zwanzig Sternen, weiss auf einem blauen Untergrund, habe. Wann immer ein            neuer Staat dazukäme, sollte ein weiterer Stern zu der Einheit hinzugefügt            werden, und zwar am vierten Juli nach dem Beitritt des Staates. Die abwechselnd            roten und weissen Streifen würden unverändert bleiben.                        1916 verkündetete Präsident Woodrow Wilson, dass im ganzen Land            am 14. Juni, dem Geburtstag der ""Star and Stripes"", der ""Flag            Day"" gefeiert werden solle. Der Kongress hat die permanente Einhaltung            dieser Proklamation erst 1949 beschlossen.

To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL.  Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management plays a central role in computing, as stand-alone utilities, or as parts of other applications.      MySQL is a relational database management system.   A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and flexibility.  The tables are linked by defined relations making it possible to combine data from several tables on request.  The SQL part of MySQL stands for ""Structured Query Language"" - the most common standardized language used to access databases.       MySQL is Open Source Software.   Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify. Anybody can download MySQL from the Internet and use it without paying anything.  Anybody so inclined can study the source code and change it to fit their needs.  MySQL uses the GPL (GNU General Public License)  http://www.gnu.org , to define what you may and may not do with the software in different situations.  If you feel uncomfortable with the GPL or need to embed MySQL into a commercial application you can buy a commercially licensed version from us.        Why use MySQL?   MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.  If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try.  MySQL also has a very practical set of features developed in very close cooperation with our users.  You can find a performance comparison of MySQL to some other database managers on our benchmark page. See section  5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite .  MySQL was originally developed to handle very large databases much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though under constant development, MySQL today offers a rich and very useful set of functions.  The connectivity, speed, and security make MySQL highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.   The technical features of MySQL   For advanced technical information, see section  6  MySQL Language Reference .  MySQL is a client/server system that consists of a multi-threaded SQL server that supports different backends, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools, and several programming interfaces.  We also provide MySQL as a multi-threaded library which you can link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier to manage product.   MySQL has a lot of contributed software available.   It is very likely that you will find that your favorite application or language already supports MySQL.             The official way to pronounce MySQL is ``My Ess Que Ell'' (not MY-SEQUEL). But we try to avoid correcting people who say MY-SEQUEL.        1.1.2  What Is MySQL AB            MySQL AB is the Swedish company owned and run by the MySQL founders and main developers.

The primary document is the Texinfo file. The HTML version is produced automatically using a modified version of  texi2html .  The plain text and Info versions are produced with  makeinfo .  The Postscript version is produced using  texi2dvi  and  dvips .  The PDF version is produced with  pdftex .               This manual is written and maintained by David Axmark, Michael (Monty) Widenius, Jeremy Cole, and Paul DuBois.  For other contributors, see section  E  Credits .        1.1.4  Conventions Used in This Manual     This manual uses certain typographical conventions:                   constant    Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL statements; database, table and column names; C and Perl code; and environment variables. Example: ``To see how  mysqladmin  works, invoke it with the  --help  option.''   `filename'    Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and pathnames.  Example: ``The distribution is installed under the  `/usr/local/'  directory.''   `c'    Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate character sequences.  Example: ``To specify a wild card, use the  `%'  character.''   italic    Italic font is used for emphasis,  like this .   boldface    Boldface font is used for access privilege names (for example, ``do not grant the  process  privilege lightly'') and occasionally to convey  especially strong emphasis .      When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.  For example,  shell>  indicates a command that you execute from your login shell, and  mysql>  indicates a command that you execute from the  mysql  client program:      shell> type a shell command here mysql> type a mysql command here      Shell commands are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you are using a  csh -style shell, you may need to issue commands slightly differently. For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:      shell> VARNAME=value some_command               For  csh , you would execute the sequence like this:      shell> setenv VARNAME value shell> some_command      Often, database, table, and column names must be substituted into commands.  To indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual uses  db_name ,  tbl_name  and  col_name .  For example, you might see a statement like this:      mysql> SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;      This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would supply your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:      mysql> SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;      SQL statements may be written in uppercase or lowercase.  When this manual shows a SQL statement, uppercase is used for particular keywords if those keywords are under discussion (to emphasize them) and lowercase is used for the rest of the statement.  For example, you might see the following in a discussion of the  SELECT  statement:      mysql> SELECT count(*) FROM tbl_name;      On the other hand, in a discussion of the  COUNT()  function, the same statement would be written like this:      mysql> select COUNT(*) from tbl_name;      If no particular emphasis is intended, all keywords are written uniformly in uppercase.      In syntax descriptions, square brackets ( `['  and  `]' ) are used to indicate optional words or clauses:      DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name      When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the alternatives are separated by vertical bars ( `|' ).  When one member from a set of choices  may  be chosen, the alternatives are listed within square brackets ( `['  and  `]' ):      TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)      When one member from a set of choices  must  be chosen, the alternatives are listed within braces ( `{'  and  `}' ):      {DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name {col_name | wild}       1.1.5  History of MySQL                  We once started out with the intention of using  mSQL  to connect to our tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some testing we came to the conclusion that  mSQL  was not fast enough nor flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to our database but with almost the same API interface as  mSQL .  This API was chosen to ease porting of third-party code.      The derivation of the name MySQL is not perfectly clear.  Our base directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix ``my'' for well over 10 years.  However, Monty's daughter (some years younger) is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to MySQL is still a mystery, even for us.        1.1.6  The Main Features of MySQL              The following list describes some of the important characteristics of MySQL:          Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can easily use multiple CPUs if available.     C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Tcl APIs.  See section  8  MySQL APIs .     Works on many different platforms.  See section  2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL .     Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes long,  FLOAT ,  DOUBLE ,  CHAR ,  VARCHAR ,  TEXT ,  BLOB ,  DATE ,  TIME ,  DATETIME ,  TIMESTAMP ,  YEAR ,  SET , and  ENUM  types.  See section  6.2  Column Types .     Very fast joins using an optimized one-sweep multi-join.     Full operator and function support in the  SELECT  and  WHERE  parts of queries.  For example:    mysql> SELECT CONCAT(first_name, "" "", last_name) FROM tbl_name            WHERE income/dependents > 10000 AND age > 30;       SQL functions are implemented through a highly optimized class library and should be as fast as possible!  Usually there isn't any memory allocation  at all after query initialization.     Full support for SQL  GROUP BY  and  ORDER BY  clauses.  Support  for group functions ( COUNT() ,  COUNT(DISTINCT ...) ,   AVG() ,  STD() ,  SUM() ,  MAX()  and  MIN() ).     Support for  LEFT OUTER JOIN  and  RIGHT OUTER JOIN  with ANSI SQL and ODBC syntax.     You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as of Version 3.22).     A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure, and allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because all password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.     ODBC (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) support for Win32 (with source).  All ODBC 2.5 functions and many others.  For example, you can use MS Access to connect to your MySQL server.  See section  8.3  MySQL ODBC Support .     Very fast B-tree disk tables with index compression.     Up to 32 indexes per table are allowed.  Each index may consist of 1 to 16 columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index length is 500 bytes (this may be changed when compiling MySQL).  An index may use a prefix of a  CHAR  or  VARCHAR  field.     Fixed-length and variable-length records.     In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.     Handles large databases.  We are using MySQL with some databases that contain 50,000,000 records and we know of users that uses MySQL with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows     All columns have default values.  You can use  INSERT  to insert a subset of a table's columns; those columns that are not explicitly given values are set to their default values.     Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.     Written in C and C++.  Tested with a broad range of different compilers.     A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.     No memory leaks.  MySQL has been tested with Purify, a commercial memory leakage detector.     Includes  myisamchk , a very fast utility for table checking, optimization, and repair.  All of the functionality of  myisamchk  is also available through the SQL interface as well.   See section  4  MySQL Database Administration .     Full support for several different character sets, including ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), big5, ujis, and more.  For example, the Scandinavian characters `@ringaccent{a}', `@""a' and `@""o' are allowed in table and column names.     All data are saved in the chosen character set.  All comparisons for normal string columns are case insensitive.     Sorting is done according to the chosen character set (the Swedish way by default).  It is possible to change this when the MySQL server is started up.  To see an example of very advanced sorting, look at the Czech sorting code.  MySQL supports many different character sets that can be specified at compile and run time.     Aliases on tables and columns are allowed as in the SQL92 standard.      DELETE ,  INSERT ,  REPLACE , and  UPDATE  return the number of rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return the number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the server.     Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For example,   ABS  is a valid column name.  The only restriction is that for a  function call, no spaces are allowed between the function name and the   `('  that follows it.  See section  6.1.6  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words? .     All MySQL programs can be invoked with the  --help  or  -?  options to obtain online assistance.     The server can provide error messages to clients in many languages.  See section  4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages .     Clients may connect to the MySQL server using TCP/IP Sockets, Unix Sockets (Unix), or Named Pipes (NT).     The MySQL-specific  SHOW  command can be used to retrieve information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The  EXPLAIN  command can be used to determine how the optimizer resolves a query.       1.1.7  How Stable Is MySQL?            This section addresses the questions ``How stable is MySQL?'' and  ``Can I depend on MySQL in this project?''  We will try to clarify some issues and to answer some of the more important questions that seem to  concern many people.  This section has been put together from information  gathered from the mailing list (which is very active in reporting bugs).      At TcX, MySQL has worked without any problems in our projects since mid-1996.  When MySQL was released to a wider public, we noticed that there were some pieces of ``untested code'' that were quickly found by the new users who made queries in a manner different than our own.  Each new release has had fewer portability problems than the previous one (even though each has had many new features).      Each release of MySQL has been usable, and there have been problems only when users start to use code from the ``gray zones.''  Naturally, outside users don't know what the gray zones are; this section attempts to indicate those that are currently known.  The descriptions deal with Version 3.23 of MySQL.  All known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest  version, with the exception of the bugs listed in the bugs section, which  are things that are design-related.  See section  1.4.7  Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL .      MySQL is written in multiple layers and different independent modules.  These modules are listed below with an indication of how well-tested each of them is:               The ISAM table handler -- Stable    This manages storage and retrieval of all data in MySQL Version 3.22 and earlier.  In all MySQL releases there hasn't been a single  (reported) bug in this code. The only known way to get a corrupted table  is to kill the server in the middle of an update.  Even that is unlikely  to destroy any data beyond rescue, because all data are flushed to disk  between each query.  There hasn't been a single bug report about lost data  because of bugs in MySQL.            The MyISAM table handler -- Stable    This is new in MySQL Version 3.23.  It's largely based on the ISAM table code but has a lot of new and very useful features.   The parser and lexical analyser -- Stable    There hasn't been a single reported bug in this system for a long time.   The C client code -- Stable    No known problems.  In early Version 3.20 releases, there were some limitations in the send/receive buffer size.  As of Version 3.21, the buffer size is now dynamic up to a default of 16M.   Standard client programs -- Stable    These include  mysql ,  mysqladmin ,  mysqlshow ,  mysqldump , and  mysqlimport .   Basic SQL -- Stable    The basic SQL function system and string classes and dynamic memory handling.  Not a single reported bug in this system.   Query optimizer -- Stable     Range optimizer -- Stable     Join optimizer -- Stable     Locking -- Gamma    This is very system-dependent.  On some systems there are big problems using standard OS locking ( fcntl() ).  In these cases, you should run the MySQL daemon with the  --skip-locking  flag.  Problems are known to occur on some Linux systems, and on SunOS when using NFS-mounted file systems.   Linux threads -- Stable    The major problem found has been with the  fcntl()  call, which is fixed by using the  --skip-locking  option to  mysqld .  Some people have reported lockup problems with Version 0.5. LinuxThreads will need to be recompiled if you plan to use 1000+ concurrent connections.  Although it is possible to run that many connections with the default LinuxThreads (however, you will never go above 1021), the default stack spacing of 2 MB makes the application unstable, and we have been able to reproduce a coredump after creating 1021 idle connections.  See section  2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions) .   Solaris 2.5+ pthreads -- Stable    We use this for all our production work.   MIT-pthreads (Other systems) -- Stable    There have been no reported bugs since Version 3.20.15 and no known bugs since Version 3.20.16.  On some systems, there is a ``misfeature'' where some operations are quite slow (a 1/20 second sleep is done between each query). Of course, MIT-pthreads may slow down everything a bit, but index-based  SELECT  statements are usually done in one time frame so there shouldn't be a mutex locking/thread juggling.   Other thread implementions -- Beta - Gamma    The ports to other systems are still very new and may have bugs, possibly in MySQL, but most often in the thread implementation itself.   LOAD DATA ... ,  INSERT ... SELECT  -- Stable    Some people thought they had found bugs here, but these usually have turned out to be misunderstandings.  Please check the manual before reporting problems!   ALTER TABLE  -- Stable    Small changes in Version 3.22.12.   DBD -- Stable    Now maintained by Jochen Wiedmann  ( wiedmann@neckar-alb.de ).  Thanks!   mysqlaccess  -- Stable    Written and maintained by Yves Carlier  ( Yves.Carlier@rug.ac.be ). Thanks!   GRANT  -- Stable    Big changes made in MySQL Version 3.22.12.   MyODBC  (uses ODBC SDK 2.5) -- Gamma    It seems to work well with some programs.   Replication -- Beta / Gamma    We are still working on replication, so don't expect this to be rock solid yet.  On the other hand, some MySQL users are already using this with good results.   BDB Tables -- Beta    The Berkeley DB code is very stable, but we are still improving the interface between MySQL and BDB tables, so it will take some time before this is as tested as the other table types.   InnoDB Tables -- Beta    This is a recent addition to  MySQL . They appear to work good and can be used after some initial testing.   Automatic recovery of MyISAM tables - Beta    This only affects the new code that checks if the table was closed properly on open and executes an automatic check/repair of the table if it wasn't.   MERGE tables -- Beta / Gamma    The usage of keys on  MERGE  tables is still not that tested.  The other part of the  MERGE  code is quite well tested.   FULLTEXT -- Beta    Text search seems to work, but is still not widely used.       MySQL AB provides e-mail support for paying customers, but the  MySQL mailing list usually provides answers to common questions. Bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch; for serious bugs, there is almost always a new release.        1.1.8  How Big Can MySQL Tables Be?                    MySQL Version 3.22 has a 4G limit on table size. With the new  MyISAM  in MySQL Version 3.23 the maximum table size is pushed up to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes).      Note, however, that operating systems have their own file size limits. Here are some examples:       Operating System     File Size Limit     Linux-Intel 32 bit   2G, 4G or more, depends on Linux version    Linux-Alpha   8T (?)    Solaris 2.5.1   2G (possible 4G with patch)    Solaris 2.6   4G    Solaris 2.7 Intel   4G    Solaris 2.7 ULTRA-SPARC   8T (?)        On Linux 2.2 you can get bigger tables than 2G by using the LFS patch for the ext2 file system.  On Linux 2.4 there exists also patches for ReiserFS to get support for big files.      This means that the table size for MySQL is normally limited by the operating system.      By default, MySQL tables have a maximum size of about 4G.  You can check the maximum table size for a table with the  SHOW TABLE STATUS  command or with the  myisamchk -dv table_name . See section  4.5.5   SHOW  Syntax .      If you need bigger tables than 4G (and your operating system supports this), you should set the  AVG_ROW_LENGTH  and  MAX_ROWS  parameter when you create your table.  See section  6.5.3   CREATE TABLE  Syntax .  You can also set these later with  ALTER TABLE . See section  6.5.4   ALTER TABLE  Syntax .      If your big table is going to be read-only, you could use  myisampack  to merge and compress many tables to one.  myisampack  usually compresses a table by at least 50%, so you can have, in effect, much bigger tables.  See section  4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator .      You can go around the operating system file limit for  MyISAM  data files by using the  RAID  option. See section  6.5.3   CREATE TABLE  Syntax .      Another solution can be the included MERGE library, which allows you to handle a collection of identical tables as one. See section  7.2  MERGE Tables .        1.1.9  Year 2000 Compliance                MySQL itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance:          MySQL uses Unix time functions and has no problems with dates until  2069 ; all 2-digit years are regarded to be in the range  1970  to  2069 , which means that if you store  01  in a  year  column, MySQL treats it as  2001 .     All MySQL date functions are stored in one file  `sql/time.cc'  and coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.     In MySQL Version 3.22 and later, the new  YEAR  column type can store years  0  and  1901  to  2155  in 1 byte and display them using 2 or 4 digits.      You may run into problems with applications that use MySQL in a way that is not Y2K-safe.  For example, many old applications store or manipulate years using 2-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than 4-digit values.  This problem may be compounded by applications that use values such as  00  or  99  as ``missing'' value indicators.      Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix, because different applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.      Here is a simple demonstration illustrating that MySQL doesn't have any problems with dates until the year 2030:      mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS y2k; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)  mysql> CREATE TABLE y2k (date date, date_time datetime, time_stamp timestamp); Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)  mysql> INSERT INTO y2k VALUES      -> (""1998-12-31"",""1998-12-31 23:59:59"",19981231235959),     -> (""1999-01-01"",""1999-01-01 00:00:00"",19990101000000),     -> (""1999-09-09"",""1999-09-09 23:59:59"",19990909235959),     -> (""2000-01-01"",""2000-01-01 00:00:00"",20000101000000),     -> (""2000-02-28"",""2000-02-28 00:00:00"",20000228000000),     -> (""2000-02-29"",""2000-02-29 00:00:00"",20000229000000),     -> (""2000-03-01"",""2000-03-01 00:00:00"",20000301000000),     -> (""2000-12-31"",""2000-12-31 23:59:59"",20001231235959),     -> (""2001-01-01"",""2001-01-01 00:00:00"",20010101000000),     -> (""2004-12-31"",""2004-12-31 23:59:59"",20041231235959),     -> (""2005-01-01"",""2005-01-01 00:00:00"",20050101000000),     -> (""2030-01-01"",""2030-01-01 00:00:00"",20300101000000),     -> (""2050-01-01"",""2050-01-01 00:00:00"",20500101000000); Query OK, 13 rows affected (0.01 sec) Records: 13  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0  mysql> SELECT * FROM y2k; +------------+---------------------+----------------+ | date       | date_time           | time_stamp     | +------------+---------------------+----------------+ | 1998-12-31 | 1998-12-31 23:59:59 | 19981231235959 | | 1999-01-01 | 1999-01-01 00:00:00 | 19990101000000 | | 1999-09-09 | 1999-09-09 23:59:59 | 19990909235959 | | 2000-01-01 | 2000-01-01 00:00:00 | 20000101000000 | | 2000-02-28 | 2000-02-28 00:00:00 | 20000228000000 | | 2000-02-29 | 2000-02-29 00:00:00 | 20000229000000 | | 2000-03-01 | 2000-03-01 00:00:00 | 20000301000000 | | 2000-12-31 | 2000-12-31 23:59:59 | 20001231235959 | | 2001-01-01 | 2001-01-01 00:00:00 | 20010101000000 | | 2004-12-31 | 2004-12-31 23:59:59 | 20041231235959 | | 2005-01-01 | 2005-01-01 00:00:00 | 20050101000000 | | 2030-01-01 | 2030-01-01 00:00:00 | 20300101000000 | | 2050-01-01 | 2050-01-01 00:00:00 | 00000000000000 | +------------+---------------------+----------------+ 13 rows in set (0.00 sec)       This shows that the  DATE  and  DATETIME  types will not give any problems with future dates (they handle dates until the year 9999).      The  TIMESTAMP  type, which is used to store the current time, has a range up to only  2030-01-01 .   TIMESTAMP  has a range of  1970  to  2030  on 32-bit machines (signed value).  On 64-bit machines it handles times up to  2106  (unsigned value).      Even though MySQL is Y2K-compliant, it is your responsibility to provide unambiguous input.  See section  6.2.2.1  Y2K Issues and Date Types  for MySQL's rules for dealing with ambiguous date input data (data containing 2-digit year values).        1.2  MySQL Information Sources                1.2.1  Books About MySQL     For the latest book information, with user comments, please visit  http://www.mysql.com/portal/books/html/index.html .

To unsubscribe from the main MySQL mailing list, send a message to the electronic mail address  mysql-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com .      Only the address to which you send your messages is significant.  The subject line and the body of the message are ignored.      If your reply address is not valid, you can specify your address explicitly.  Adding a hyphen to the subscribe or unsubscribe command word, followed by your address with the  `@'  character in your address replaced by a  `=' .  For example, to subscribe  your_name@host.domain , send a message to  mysql-subscribe-your_name=host.domain@lists.mysql.com .      Mail to  mysql-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  or  mysql-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com  is handled automatically by the ezmlm mailing list processor.  Information about ezmlm is available at   The ezmlm Website .      To post a message to the list itself, send your message to  mysql@lists.mysql.com .  However, please  do not  send mail about subscribing or unsubscribing to  mysql@lists.mysql.com , because any mail sent to that address is distributed automatically to thousands of other users.      Your local site may have many subscribers to  mysql@lists.mysql.com . If so, it may have a local mailing list, so that messages sent from  lists.mysql.com  to your site are propagated to the local list.  In such cases, please contact your system administrator to be added to or dropped from the local MySQL list.      If you wish to have traffic for a mailing list go to a separate mailbox in your mail program, set up a filter based on the message headers.  You can use either the  List-ID:  or  Delivered-To:  headers to identify list messages.      The following MySQL mailing lists exist:        announce-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  announce    This is for announcement of new versions of MySQL and related programs.  This is a low volume list all MySQL users should subscribe to.   mysql-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  mysql    The main list for general MySQL discussion.  Please note that some topics are better discussed on the more-specialized lists.  If you post to the wrong list, you may not get an answer!   mysql-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  mysql-digest    The  mysql  list in digest form.  That means you get all individual messages, sent as one large mail message once a day.   bugs-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  bugs    On this list you should only post a full, repeatable bug report using the  mysqlbug  script (if you are running on Windows, you should include a description of the operating system and the MySQL version). Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest stable or development version of MySQL before posting!  Anyone should be able to repeat the bug by just using  mysql test < script  on the included test case.  All  bugs posted on this list will be corrected or documented in the next  MySQL release!  If there are only small code changes involved, we will also post a patch that fixes the problem.   bugs-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  bugs-digest    The  bugs  list in digest form.   internals-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  internals    A list for people who work on the MySQL code.  On this list one can also discuss MySQL development and post patches.   internals-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  internals-digest    A digest version of the  internals  list.   java-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  java    Discussion about MySQL and Java.  Mostly about the JDBC drivers.   java-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  java-digest    A digest version of the  java  list.   win32-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  win32    All things concerning MySQL on Microsoft operating systems such as Win95, Win98, NT, and Win2000.   win32-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  win32-digest    A digest version of the  win32  list.   myodbc-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  myodbc    All things about connecting to MySQL with ODBC.   myodbc-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  myodbc-digest    A digest version of the  myodbc  list.   plusplus-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  plusplus    All things concerning programming with the C++ API to MySQL.   plusplus-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  plusplus-digest    A digest version of the  plusplus  list.   msql-mysql-modules-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  msql-mysql-modules    A list about the Perl support in MySQL. msql-mysql-modules   msql-mysql-modules-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  msql-mysql-modules-digest    A digest version of the  msql-mysql-modules  list.      You subscribe or unsubscribe to all lists in the same way as described above.  In your subscribe or unsubscribe message, just put the appropriate mailing list name rather than  mysql .  For example, to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the  myodbc  list, send a message to  myodbc-subscribe@lists.mysql.com  or  myodbc-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com .      If you can't get an answer for your questions from the mailing list, one option is to pay for support from MySQL AB, which will put you in direct contact with MySQL developers. See section  1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support .      The following table shows some MySQL mailing in other languages than English.  Note that these are not operated by MySQL AB, so we can't guarantee the quality on these.        mysql-france-subscribe@yahoogroups.com  A French mailing list     list@tinc.net  A Korean mailing list    Email  subscribe mysql your@email.address  to this list.  mysql-de-request@lists.4t2.com  A German mailing list    Email  subscribe mysql-de your@email.address  to this list. You can find information about this mailing list at  http://www.4t2.com/mysql .  mysql-br-request@listas.linkway.com.br  A Portugese mailing list    Email  subscribe mysql-br your@email.address  to this list.  mysql-alta@elistas.net  A Spanish mailing list    Email  subscribe mysql your@email.address  to this list.       1.2.22.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs                Before posting a bug report or question, please do the following:          Start by searching the MySQL online manual at:    http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php    We try to keep the manual up to date by updating it frequently with  solutions to newly found problems!     Search the MySQL mailing list archives:    http://www.mysql.com/documentation/       You can also use  http://www.mysql.com/search.html  to search all the Web pages (including the manual) that are located at   http://www.mysql.com/ .      If you can't find an answer in the manual or the archives, check with your local MySQL expert.  If you still can't find an answer to your question, go ahead and read the next section about how to send mail to  mysql@lists.mysql.com .        1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems                        Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first time saves time for us and for you.  A good bug report containing a full test case for the bug will make it very likely that we will fix it in the next release.  This section will help you write your report correctly so that you don't waste your time doing things that may not help us much or at all.      We encourage everyone to use the  mysqlbug  script to generate a bug report (or a report about any problem), if possible.   mysqlbug  can be found in the  `scripts'  directory in the source distribution, or, for a binary distribution, in the  `bin'  directory under your MySQL installation directory.  If you are unable to use  mysqlbug , you should still include all the necessary information listed in this section.      The  mysqlbug  script helps you generate a report by determining much of the following information automatically, but if something important is missing, please include it with your message!  Please read this section carefully and make sure that all the information described here is included in your report.        The normal place to report bugs and problems is  mysql@lists.mysql.com .  If you can make a test case that clearly demonstrates the bug, you should post it to the  bugs@lists.mysql.com  list.  Note that on this list you should only post a full, repeatable bug report using the  mysqlbug  script.  If you are running on Windows, you should include a description of the operating system and the MySQL version.  Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest stable or development version of MySQL before posting!  Anyone should be able to repeat the bug by just using `` mysql test < script '' on the included test case or run the shell or perl script that is included in the bug report.  All bugs posted on the  bugs  list will be corrected or documented in the next MySQL release!  If there are only small code changes involved to correct this problem, we will also post a patch that fixes the problem.      Remember that it is possible to respond to a message containing too much information, but not to one containing too little.  Often people omit facts because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume that some details don't matter.  A good principle is: if you are in doubt about stating something, state it!  It is a thousand times faster and less troublesome to write a couple of lines more in your report than to be forced to ask again and wait for the answer because you didn't include enough information the first time.      The most common errors are that people don't indicate the version number of the MySQL distribution they are using, or don't indicate what platform they have MySQL installed on (including the platform version number).  This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of 100 the bug report is useless without it!  Very often we get questions like, ``Why doesn't this work for me?'' then we find that the feature requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug described in a report has been fixed already in newer MySQL versions.  Sometimes the error is platform dependent; in such cases, it is next to impossible to fix anything without knowing the operating system and the version number of the platform.      Remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is related to the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all the time and become better version by version.  To determine whether or not your problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler is used. Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug report and reported accordingly.      It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included in the bug report.  That is, a good example of all the things you did that led to the problem and the problem itself exactly described.  The best reports are those that include a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or problem.  See section  G.1.6  Making a test case when you experience table corruption .      If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include the message in your report!  If we try to search for something from the archives using programs, it is better that the error message reported exactly matches the one that the program produces.  (Even the case should be observed!)  You should never try to remember what the error message was; instead, copy  and paste the entire message into your report!      If you have a problem with MyODBC, you should try to generate a MyODBC trace file.  See section  8.3.7  Reporting Problems with MyODBC .      Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples using the  mysql  command line tool, you should therefore use the  --vertical  option (or the  \G  statement terminator) for output that would exceed the available width for such a display (for example, with the  EXPLAIN SELECT  statement; see the example below).        Please include the following information in your report:          The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for example, MySQL Version 3.22.22). You can find out which version you are running by executing  mysqladmin version .   mysqladmin  can be found in the  `bin'  directory under your MySQL installation directory.     The manufacturer and model of the machine you are working on.     The operating system name and version.  For most operating systems, you can get this information by executing the Unix command  uname -a .     Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If in doubt,  include these values.     If you are using a source distribution of MySQL, the name and version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a binary  distribution, the distribution name is needed.     If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error message(s) and also a few lines of context around the offending code in the file where the error occurred.     If  mysqld  died, you should also report the query that crashed  mysqld .  You can usually find this out by running  mysqld  with logging enabled.  See section  G.1.5  Using log files to find cause of errors in mysqld .     If any database table is related to the problem, include the output from  mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ... .  This is very easy to do and is a powerful way to get information about any table in a database that will help us create a situation matching the one you have.     For speed-related bugs or problems with  SELECT  statements, you should always include the output of  EXPLAIN SELECT ... , and at least the number of rows that the  SELECT  statement produces.  The more information you give about your situation, the more likely it is that someone can help you!  For example, the following is an example of a very good bug report (it should of course be posted with the  mysqlbug  script):  Example run using the  mysql  command line tool (note the use of the  \G  statement terminator for statements whose output width would otherwise exceed that of an 80-column display device):    mysql> SHOW VARIABLES; mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G        <output from SHOW COLUMNS> mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G        <output from EXPLAIN> mysql> FLUSH STATUS; mysql> SELECT ...;        <A short version of the output from SELECT,        including the time taken to run the query> mysql> SHOW STATUS;        <output from SHOW STATUS>       If a bug or problem occurs while running  mysqld , try to provide an input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script should include any necessary source files.  The more closely the script can reproduce your situation, the better.  If you can make a repeatable test case, you should post this to  bugs@lists.mysql.com  for a high priority treatment!  If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the output from  mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist  in your mail to provide some information of how your system is performing!     If you can't produce a test case in a few rows, or if the test table is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10 rows), you should dump your tables using  mysqldump  and create a  `README'  file that describes your problem.  Create a compressed archive of your files using  tar  and  gzip  or  zip , and use  ftp  to transfer the  archive to  ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/ .  Then send a  short description of the problem to  bugs@lists.mysql.com .     If you think that MySQL produces a strange result from a query, include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the result should be, and an account describing the basis for your opinion.     When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the variable names, table names, etc., that exist in your actual situation than to come up with new names.  The problem could be related to the name of a variable or table! These cases are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry. After all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your  actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case you have data you don't want to show to others, you can use  ftp  to transfer it to   ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/ .  If the data are really top secret and you don't want to show them even to us, then go ahead and provide  an example using other names, but please regard this as the last choice.     Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if possible.  For example, indicate the options that you use when you start the  mysqld  daemon and that you use to run any MySQL client programs.  The options to programs like  mysqld  and  mysql , and to the  configure  script, are often keys to answers and are very relevant! It is never a bad idea to include them anyway!  If you use any modules, such as Perl or PHP, please include the version number(s) of those as well.     If your question is related to the privilege system, please include the output of  mysqlaccess , the output of  mysqladmin reload , and all the error messages you get when trying to connect!  When you test your privileges, you should first run  mysqlaccess .  After this, execute  mysqladmin reload version  and try to connect with the program that gives you trouble.   mysqlaccess  can be found in the  `bin'  directory under your MySQL installation directory.     If you have a patch for a bug, that is good, but don't assume the patch is all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide some necessary information, such as test cases showing the bug that your patch fixes.  We might find problems with your patch or we might not understand it at all; if so, we can't use it.  If we can't verify exactly what the patch is meant for, we won't use it. Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will handle all the situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline case (even a rare one) where the patch won't work, it may be useless.     Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends on, are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a bug.     Indicate in your mail message that you have checked the reference manual and mail archive so others know that you have tried to solve the problem yourself.     If you get a  parse error , please check your syntax closely!  If you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that your current version of MySQL doesn't support the query you are using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at  http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php  doesn't cover the syntax you are using, MySQL doesn't support your query.  In this case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or e-mail  mysql-licensing@mysql.com  and ask for an offer to implement it!  If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an older version of MySQL, you should check the MySQL change history to see when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have the option of  upgrading to a newer version of MySQL.  See section  F  MySQL change history .     If you have a problem such that your data appears corrupt or you get errors when you access some particular table, you should first check and then try repairing your tables with  myisamchk  or  CHECK TABLE  and  REPAIR TABLE .  See section  4  MySQL Database Administration .     If you often get corrupted tables you should try to find out when and why this happens!  In this case, the  `mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'  file  may contain some information about what happened.  See section  4.9.1  The Error Log .  Please include any relevant information from this file in your bug report!  Normally   mysqld  should  NEVER  crash a table if nothing killed it in the middle of an update!  If you can find the cause of  mysqld  dying, it's much easier for us to provide you with a fix for the problem! See section  A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems .     If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL and check whether or not it solves your problem.  All versions of  MySQL are thoroughly tested and should work without problems!  We  believe in making everything as backward compatible as possible, and you  should be able to switch MySQL versions in minutes!   See section  2.2.3  Which MySQL Version to Use .              If you are a support customer, please cross-post the bug report to  mysql-support@mysql.com  for higher priority treatment, as well as to the appropriate mailing list to see if someone else has experienced (and perhaps solved) the problem.      For information on reporting bugs in  MyODBC , see section  8.3.4  How to Report Problems with MyODBC .      For solutions to some common problems, see See section  A  Problems and Common Errors .      When answers are sent to you individually and not to the mailing list, it is considered good etiquette to summarize the answers and send the summary to the mailing list so that others may have the benefit of responses you received that helped you solve your problem!        1.2.22.4  Guidelines for Answering Question on the Mailing List                  If you consider your answer to have broad interest, you may want to post it to the mailing list instead of replying directly to the individual who asked.  Try to make your answer general enough that people other than the original poster may benefit from it.  When you post to the list, please make sure that your answer is not a duplication of a previous answer.      Try to summarize the essential part of the question in your reply; don't feel obliged to quote the entire original message.      Please don't post mail messages from your browser with HTML mode turned on! Many users don't read mail with a browser!        1.3  MySQL Licensing and Support               This section describes MySQL support and licensing arrangements:         The copyrights under which MySQL is distributed  (see section  1.3.2  Copyrights Used by MySQL )   Sample situations illustrating when a license is required  (see section  1.3.3  Example Licensing Situations )   Support costs (see section  1.3.4  MySQL Licensing and Support Costs ) and support benefits  (see section  1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support )   Commercial licensing costs        1.3.1  MySQL Licensing Policy                  The formal terms of the GPL license can be found at section  K  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE . Basically, our licensing policy and interpretation of the GPL is as follows:      Note that older versions of MySQL are still using a more   strict license .  See the documentation for that version for more information. If you need a  commercial MySQL license, because the GPL license doesn't suit your application, you can buy one at  https://order.mysql.com/ .      For normal internal use, MySQL costs nothing.  You do not have to pay us if you do not want to.      A license is required if:          You link a program, that is not free software, with code from the MySQL server or clients that has the GPL copyright. This happens for example when you use MySQL as an embedded server in your applications or when you add not free extensions to the MySQL server.  In this case your application/code would also become GPL through the GPL license that acts as a virus.  By licensing MySQL server from MySQL AB under a commercial license you will avoid this problem. See  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html .    You have a commercial application that ONLY works with MySQL and ships the application with the MySQL server.  This is because we view this as linking even if it is done over the network.     You have a distribution of MySQL and you don't provide the source code for your copy of the MySQL server, as defined in the GPL license.      A license is  NOT  required if:           You do not need a license to include the client code in commercial programs.  The client part of MySQL licensed with the LGPL  GNU Library General Public License .  The  mysql  command-line client includes code from the  readline  library that is under the  GPL .     If your use of MySQL does not require a license, but you like MySQL and want to encourage further development, you are certainly welcome to purchase a license or MySQL support anyway.     If you use MySQL in a commercial context such that you profit by  its use, we ask that you further the development of MySQL by  purchasing some level of support.  We feel that if MySQL helps  your business, it is reasonable to ask that you help MySQL.   (Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only using for  free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're asking us to  provide free support, too.)      For circumstances under which a MySQL license is required, you need a license per machine that runs the  mysqld  server.  However, a multiple-CPU machine counts as a single machine, and there is no restriction on the number of MySQL servers that run on one machine, or on the number of clients concurrently connected to a server running on that machine!      If you have any questions as to whether or not a license is required for your particular use of MySQL, please read this again and then contact us.  See section  1.3.4.2  Contact Information .      If you require a MySQL license, the easiest way to pay for it is to use the license form on MySQL's secure server at  https://order.mysql.com/ .  Other forms of payment are discussed in section  1.3.4.1  Payment information .        1.3.2  Copyrights Used by MySQL             There are several different copyrights on the MySQL distribution:          The MySQL-specific source needed to build the  mysqlclient  library is licensed under the  LGPL  and programs in the  `client'  directory is GPL. Each file has a header that shows which copyright is used for that file.   The client library and the (GNU  getopt ) library are covered  by the ``GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.''  See section  L  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE .   Some parts of the source (the  regexp  library) are covered  by a Berkeley-style copyright.     All the source in the server and the (GNU  readline ) library is covered by the ``GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.''  See section  K  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE .  This is also available as the file  `COPYING'  in the distributions.       One goal is that the SQL client library should be free enough that it is possible to add MySQL support into commercial products without a license.  For this reason, we chose the LGPL license for the client code.          This means that you can use MySQL for free with any program that uses any of the free software licenses.  MySQL is also free for any end user for his own or company usage.      However, if you use MySQL for something important to you, you may want to help secure its development by purchasing licenses or a support contract.  See section  1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support .        1.3.2.1  Copyright Changes     Version 3.22 of MySQL is still using a more strict license.   See the documentation for that version for more information.        1.3.3  Example Licensing Situations                This section describes some situations illustrating whether or not you must license the MySQL server.  Generally these examples involve providing MySQL as an integral part of a product.      Note that a single MySQL license covers any number of CPUs and  mysqld  servers on a machine!  There is no artificial limit on the number of clients that connect to the server in any way.        1.3.3.1  Selling Products that use MySQL     To determine whether or not you need a MySQL license when selling your application, you should ask whether the proper functioning of your application is dependent on the use of MySQL and whether you include the MySQL server with your product.  There are several cases to consider:          Does your application require MySQL to function properly?     If your product requires MySQL, you need a license for any machine that runs the  mysqld  server.  For example, if you've designed your application around MySQL, then you've really made a commercial product that requires the engine, so you need a license.     If your application does not require MySQL, you do not need to obtain a license.  For example, if using MySQL just adds some new optional features to your product (such as adding logging to a database if MySQL is used rather than logging to a text file), it should fall within normal use, and a license would not be required.     In other words, you need a license if you sell a product designed specifically for use with MySQL or that requires the MySQL server to function at all.  This is true whether or not you provide MySQL for your client as part of your product distribution.     It also depends on what you're doing for the client.  Do you plan to provide your client with detailed instructions on installing MySQL with your software?  Then your product may be contingent on the use of MySQL; if so, you need to buy a license.  If you are simply tying into a database that you expect already to have been installed by the time your software is purchased, then you probably don't need a license.        1.3.3.2  ISP MySQL Services                  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often host MySQL servers for their customers.  With the GPL license this does not require a license.      On the other hand, we do encourage people to use ISPs that have MySQL support, as this will give them the confidence that if they have some problem with their MySQL installation, their ISP will be able to solve the problem for them (in some cases with the help from the MySQL development team).      All ISPs that want to keep themselves up-to-date should subscribe to our  announce  mailing list so that they can be aware of fatal issues that may be relevant for their MySQL installations.      Note that if the ISP doesn't have a license for MySQL, it should give its customers at least read access to the source of the MySQL installation so that its customer can verify that it is patched correctly.        1.3.3.3  Running a Web Server Using MySQL              If you use MySQL in conjunction with a Web server on Unix, you don't have to pay for a license.      This is true even if you run a commercial Web server that uses MySQL, because you are not selling an embedded MySQL version yourself.  However, in this case we would like you to purchase MySQL support, because MySQL is helping your enterprise.        1.3.4  MySQL Licensing and Support Costs                   Our current license prices are shown below. To make a purchase, please visit  https://order.mysql.com/ .      If you pay by credit card, the currency is EURO (European Union Euro) so the prices will differ slightly.       Number of licenses     Per copy     1-9   230 EURO    10-24   138 EURO    25-49   117 EURO    50-99   102 EURO    100-249   91 EURO    250-499   76 EURO    500-999   66 EURO        For high volume (OEM) purchases, please contact  sales@mysql.com .      For OEM purchases, you must act as the middle-man for eventual problems or extension requests from your users.  We also require that OEM customers have at least an extended e-mail support contract.  Note that OEM licenses only apply for products where the user doesn't have direct access to the MySQL server (embedded system).  In other words, the MySQL server should only be used with the application that was supplied you.      If you have a low-margin, high-volume product, you can always talk to us about other terms (for example, a percent of the sale price).  If you do, please be informative about your product, pricing, market, and any other information that may be relevant.      A full-price license is not a support agreement and includes very minimal support.  This means that we try to answer any relevant questions.  If the answer is in the documentation, we will direct you to the appropriate section.  If you have not purchased a license or support, we probably will not answer at all.      If you discover what we consider a real bug, we are likely to fix it in any case.  But if you pay for support we will notify you about the fix status instead of just fixing it in a later release.      More comprehensive support is sold separately.  Descriptions of what each level of support includes are given in section  1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support .  Costs for the various types of commercial support are shown below.  Support level prices are in EURO (European Union Euro).  One EURO is about 1.06 USD.       Type of support     Cost per year     Basic e-mail support. See section  1.3.5.1  Basic E-mail Support .   EURO 200    Extended e-mail support See section  1.3.5.2  Extended E-mail Support .   EURO 1000    Login support See section  1.3.5.3  Login Support .   EURO 2000    Extended login support See section  1.3.5.4  Extended Login Support .   EURO 5000    Telephone support See section  1.3.5.5  Telephone Support .   EURO 12000        You may upgrade from any lower level of support to a higher level of support for the difference in price between the two support levels.      We do also provide telephone support (mostly emergency support but also 24/7 support).  This support option doesn't however have a fixed price but is negotiated for case to case.  If you are interested in this option you can email  sales@mysql.com  and tell us about your needs.      Note that as our sales staff is very busy, it may take some time until your request is handled.  Our support staff does however always answer promptly to support questions!        1.3.4.1  Payment information            Currently we can take SWIFT payments, checks, or credit cards.      Payment should be made to:      Postgirot Bank AB 105 06 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN  MySQL AB BOX 6434 11382 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN  SWIFT address: PGSI SESS Account number: 96 77 06 - 3      Specify: license and/or support and your name and e-mail address.      In Europe and Japan you can use EuroGiro (that should be less expensive) to the same account.      If you want to pay by check, make it payable to ``MySQL Finland AB'' and mail it to the address below:      MySQL AB BOX 6434, Torsgatan 21 11382 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN      If you want to pay by credit card over the Internet, you can use   MySQL AB's secure license form .      You can also print a copy of the license form, fill it in, and send it by fax to:      +46-8-729 69 05      If you want us to bill you, you can use the license form and write ``bill us'' in the comment field.  You can also mail a message to  sales@mysql.com  ( not   mysql@lists.mysql.com !) with your company information and ask us to bill you.        1.3.4.2  Contact Information                        For commercial licensing, please contact the MySQL licensing team.  The much preferred method is by e-mail to  licensing@mysql.com .  Fax is also possible but handling of these may take much longer (Fax +46-8-729 69 05).      If you represent a business that is interested in partnering with MySQL, please send e-mail to  partner@mysql.com .      For timely, precise answers to technical questions about MySQL you should   order  one of our   support contracts . MySQL support is provided by the MySQL developers so the standard is extremely high.      If you are interested in placing a banner advertisement on our Web site, please send e-mail to  advertising@mysql.com .      If you are interested in any of the jobs listed in our   jobs  section, please send e-mail to  jobs@mysql.com .      For general discussion amongst our many users, please direct your attention to the appropriate   mailing list .      For general information inquires, please send e-mail to  info@mysql.com .      For questions or comments about the workings or content of the Web site, please send e-mail to  webmaster@mysql.com .        1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support                 The following is true of all support options:          The support is per year.    We will fix, or provide a reasonable workaround for any repeatable bug.    We will give a reasonable effort to find and fix any other MySQL related bug.    The higher level of support contract the more effort we will put into finding a solution to your problems.    The following is true for all support contracts except Basic email support:  For non-bug related things, like helping you optimize your queries or your system, extending MySQL with new functionality, etc., we charge 200 EURO/hour, which is deducted from your support contract.  In other words, if you have login support (2000 EURO), you can expect us to work up to 10 hours to help you with things like this.       1.3.5.1  Basic E-mail Support              Basic e-mail support is a very inexpensive support option and should be thought of more as a way to support our development of MySQL than as a real support option.  We at MySQL do give a lot of free support in all the different MySQL lists, and the money we get from basic e-mail support is largely used to make this possible.      At this support level, the MySQL mailing lists are the preferred means of communication.  Questions normally should be mailed to the primary mailing list ( mysql@lists.mysql.com ) or one of the other regular lists (for example,  win32@lists.mysql.com  for Windows-related MySQL questions), as someone else already may have experienced and solved the problem you have.  See section  1.2.22.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs .      However, by purchasing basic e-mail support, you also have access to the support address  mysql-support@mysql.com , which is not available as part of the minimal support that you get by purchasing a MySQL license.  This means that for especially critical questions, you can  cross-post your message to  mysql-support@mysql.com .  (If the  message contains sensitive data, you should post only to   mysql-support@mysql.com .)       REMEMBER!  to ALWAYS include your registration number and expiration  date when you send a message to  mysql-support@mysql.com .      Note that if you have encountered a critical, repeatable bug, and follow the rules outlined in the manual section of how to report bugs and send it to  bugs@lists.mysql.com , we promise to try to fix this as soon as possible, regardless of your support level!  See section  1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems .      Basic e-mail support includes the following types of service:          If your question is already answered in the manual, we will inform you of the correct section in which you can find the answer.  If the answer is not in the manual, we will point you in the right direction to solve your problem.     We guarantee a timely answer for your e-mail messages.  We can't guarantee that we can solve any problem, but at least you will receive an answer if we can contact you by e-mail.     We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL from a binary distribution on supported platforms.  This level of support does not cover installing MySQL from a source distribution.  Supported platforms are those for which MySQL is known to work. See section  2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL .     We will help you with bugs and missing features.  Any bugs that are found are fixed for the next MySQL release.  If the bug is critical for you, we will mail you a patch for it as soon the bug is fixed.  Critical bugs always have the highest priority for us, and we ensure that they are fixed as soon as possible.     Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will be taken into consideration.  By taking email support you have already helped the further development of MySQL.  If you want to have more input, upgrade to a higher level of support.     If you want us to help optimize your system, you must upgrade to a higher level of support.       1.3.5.2  Extended E-mail Support            Extended e-mail support includes everything in basic e-mail support with these additions:          Your e-mail will be dealt with before mail from basic e-mail support users and non-registered users.     Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will receive strong consideration.  Simple extensions that suit the basic goals of MySQL are implemented in a matter of days.  By taking extended e-mail support you have already helped the further development of MySQL.     Typical situations that are covered by extended e-mail support are:        We will answer and (within reason) solve questions that relate to possible bugs in MySQL.  As soon as the bug is found and corrected, we will mail a patch for it.     We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL from a source or binary distribution on supported platforms.     We will answer questions about missing features and offer hints how to work around them.     We will provide hints on optimizing  mysqld  for your situation.       You are allowed to influence the priority of items on the MySQL TODO List.  See section  1.6  MySQL and the future (The TODO) .  This will ensure that the features you really need will be implemented sooner than they might be otherwise.       1.3.5.3  Login Support            Login support includes everything in extended e-mail support with these additions:          Your e-mail will be dealt with even before e-mail from extended e-mail support users.     Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will be taken into very high consideration.  Realistic extensions that can be implemented in a couple of hours and that suit the basic goals of MySQL will be implemented as soon as possible.     If you have a very specific problem, we can try to log in on your system to solve the problem ``in place.''     Like any database vendor, we can't guarantee that we can rescue any data from crashed tables, but if the worst happens, we will help you rescue as much as possible.  MySQL has proven itself very reliable, but anything is possible due to circumstances beyond our control (for example, if your system crashes or someone kills the server by executing a  kill -9  command).     We will provide hints on optimizing your system and your queries.     You are allowed to call a MySQL developer (in moderation) and discuss your MySQL-related problems.  This option is however only to be used as a last result during an emergency after we have failed to grasp the total problem with email.  To make efficient use of our time we need to first get all facts about the problem, before talking on phone, to be able to work as efficiently as possible on solving the problem.       1.3.5.4  Extended Login Support     Extended login support includes everything in login support with these additions:          Your e-mail has the highest possible priority.     We will actively examine your system and help you optimize it and your queries.  We may also optimize and/or extend MySQL to better suit your needs.     You may also request special extensions just for you.  For example:   mysql> select MY_FUNC(col1,col2) from table;       We will provide a binary distribution of all important MySQL releases for your system, as long as we can get an account on a similar system.  In the worst case, we may require access to your system to be able to create a binary distribution.     If you can provide accommodations and pay for traveler fares, you can even get a MySQL developer to visit you and offer you help with your troubles.  Extended login support entitles you to one personal encounter per year, but we are always very flexible towards our customers!  If the visit takes 16 hours or more, the first 8 hours is without charge.  For the hours above 8 hours, you will be charged with a rate that is at least 20 % less than our standard rates.       1.3.5.5  Telephone Support     Telephone support includes everything in extended login support with these additions:          We will provide you with a dynamic web page showing the current list of  MySQL  developers that you can phone when you have a critical problem.    For non critical problem, you can request a MySQL developer to phone back within 48 hours to discuss  MySQL  related issues.       1.3.5.6  Support for other table handlers              To get support for  BDB  tables,  InnoDB  tables you have to pay an additional 30% on the standard support price for each of the table handlers you would like to have support for.      We at  MySQL AB  will help you create a proper bug report for the table handler and submit it to the developers for the specific table handler.  We will also do our best to ensure that you will get a timely answer or solution from the developers of the table handler.      Even if we are quite confident that we can solve most problems within a timely manner, we can't guarantee a quick solution for any problems you can get with the different table handlers.  We will however do our best to help you get the problem solved.        1.4  How Standards-compatible Is MySQL?                   This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI SQL standards. MySQL has many extensions to the ANSI SQL standards, and here you will find out what they are, and how to use them.  You will also find  information about functionality missing from MySQL, and how to work  around some differences.          1.4.1  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92     MySQL includes some extensions that you probably will not find in other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments of the form  /*! ... */ .  In this case, MySQL will parse and execute the code within the comment as it would any other MySQL statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:      SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...      If you add a version number after the  '!' , the syntax will only be executed if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the used version number:      CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE (a int);      The above means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, then MySQL will use the  TEMPORARY  keyword.      MySQL extensions are listed below:          The field types  MEDIUMINT ,  SET ,  ENUM , and the different  BLOB  and  TEXT  types.     The field attributes  AUTO_INCREMENT ,  BINARY ,  NULL ,  UNSIGNED , and  ZEROFILL .     All string comparisons are case insensitive by default, with sort ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with the  BINARY  attribute or use the  BINARY  cast, which causes comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the MySQL server host.     MySQL maps each database to a directory under the MySQL data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database directory.  This has a few implications:                  Database names and table names are case sensitive in MySQL on operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix systems). See section  6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names .     Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit (but may not consist solely of digits).     You can use standard system commands to backup, rename, move, delete, and copy tables.  For example, to rename a table, rename the  `.MYD' ,  `.MYI' , and  `.frm'  files to which the table corresponds.       In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases with the  db_name.tbl_name  syntax.  Some SQL servers provide the same functionality but call this  User space . MySQL doesn't support tablespaces as in:  create table ralph.my_table...IN my_tablespace .      LIKE  is allowed on numeric columns.     Use of  INTO OUTFILE  and  STRAIGHT_JOIN  in a  SELECT  statement. See section  6.4.1   SELECT  Syntax .     The  SQL_SMALL_RESULT  option in a  SELECT  statement.      EXPLAIN SELECT  to get a description on how tables are joined.     Use of index names, indexes on a prefix of a field, and use of  INDEX  or  KEY  in a  CREATE TABLE  statement. See section  6.5.3   CREATE TABLE  Syntax .     Use of  TEMPORARY  or  IF NOT EXISTS  with  CREATE TABLE .     Use of  COUNT(DISTINCT list)  where 'list' is more than one element.     Use of  CHANGE col_name ,  DROP col_name , or  DROP INDEX ,  IGNORE  or  RENAME  in an  ALTER TABLE  statement. See section  6.5.4   ALTER TABLE  Syntax .     Use of  RENAME TABLE . See section  6.5.5   RENAME TABLE  Syntax .     Use of multiple  ADD ,  ALTER ,  DROP , or  CHANGE  clauses in an  ALTER TABLE  statement.     Use of  DROP TABLE  with the keywords  IF EXISTS .     You can drop multiple tables with a single  DROP TABLE  statement.     The  LIMIT  clause of the  DELETE  statement.     The  DELAYED  clause of the  INSERT  and  REPLACE  statements.     The  LOW_PRIORITY  clause of the  INSERT ,  REPLACE ,  DELETE , and  UPDATE  statements.         Use of  LOAD DATA INFILE . In many cases, this syntax is compatible with Oracle's  LOAD DATA INFILE . See section  6.4.8   LOAD DATA INFILE  Syntax .     The  ANALYZE TABLE ,  CHECK TABLE ,  OPTIMIZE TABLE , and  REPAIR TABLE  statements.     The  SHOW  statement. See section  4.5.5   SHOW  Syntax .     Strings may be enclosed by either  `""'  or  `'' , not just by  `'' .     Use of the escape  `\'  character.     The  SET OPTION  statement. See section  5.5.6   SET  Syntax .     You don't need to name all selected columns in the  GROUP BY  part. This gives better performance for some very specific, but quite normal queries. See section  M.3  Functions for Use with  GROUP BY  Clauses .     One can specify  ASC  and  DESC  with  GROUP BY .     To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments, MySQL supports aliases for many functions. For example, all string functions support both ANSI SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.     MySQL understands the  ||  and  &&  operators to mean logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL,  ||  and  OR  are synonyms, as are  &&  and  AND . Because of this nice syntax, MySQL doesn't support the ANSI SQL  ||  operator for string concatenation; use  CONCAT()  instead. Because  CONCAT()  takes any number of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the  ||  operator to MySQL.      CREATE DATABASE  or  DROP DATABASE . See section  6.5.1   CREATE DATABASE  Syntax .         The  %  operator is a synonym for  MOD() .  That is,  N % M  is equivalent to  MOD(N,M) .   %  is supported for C programmers and for compatibility with PostgreSQL.     The  = ,  <> ,  <=  , < ,  >= , > ,  << ,  >> ,  <=> ,  AND ,  OR , or  LIKE  operators may be used in column comparisons to the left of the  FROM  in  SELECT  statements.  For example:    mysql> SELECT col1=1 AND col2=2 FROM tbl_name;       The  LAST_INSERT_ID()  function. See section  8.4.3.126   mysql_insert_id() .     The  REGEXP  and  NOT REGEXP  extended regular expression operators.      CONCAT()  or  CHAR()  with one argument or more than two arguments.  (In MySQL, these functions can take any number of arguments.)   The  BIT_COUNT() ,  CASE ,  ELT() ,   FROM_DAYS() ,  FORMAT() ,  IF() ,  PASSWORD() ,  ENCRYPT() ,  md5() ,  ENCODE() ,  DECODE() ,  PERIOD_ADD() ,  PERIOD_DIFF() ,  TO_DAYS() , or  WEEKDAY()  functions.     Use of  TRIM()  to trim substrings. ANSI SQL only supports removal of single characters.     The  GROUP BY  functions  STD() ,  BIT_OR() , and  BIT_AND() .     Use of  REPLACE  instead of  DELETE  +  INSERT . See section  6.4.7   REPLACE  Syntax .     The  FLUSH ,  RESET  and  DO  statements.     The possibility to set variables in a statement with  := :   SELECT @a:=SUM(total),@b=COUNT(*),@a/@b AS avg FROM test_table; SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;          1.4.2  MySQL Differences Compared to ANSI SQL92     We try to make MySQL follow the ANSI SQL standard and the ODBC SQL standard, but in some cases MySQL does some things differently:           --  is only a comment if followed by a white space. See section  1.4.4.8   `--'  as the Start of a Comment .     For  VARCHAR  columns, trailing spaces are removed when the value is stored. See section  1.4.7  Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL .     In some cases,  CHAR  columns are silently changed to  VARCHAR  columns. See section  6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes .     Privileges for a table are not automatically revoked when you delete a table. You must explicitly issue a  REVOKE  to revoke privileges for a table. See section  4.3.1   GRANT  and  REVOKE  Syntax .      NULL AND FALSE  will evaluate to  NULL  and not to  FALSE . This is because we don't think it's good to have to evaluate a lot of extra conditions in this case.       1.4.3  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode              If you start  mysqld  with the  --ansi  option, the following behavior of MySQL changes:           ||  is string concatenation instead of  OR .     You can have any number of spaces between a function name and the  `(' . This forces all function names to be treated as reserved words.      `""'  will be an identifier quote character (like the MySQL  ``'  quote character) and not a string quote character.      REAL  will be a synonym for  FLOAT  instead of a synonym of  DOUBLE .     The default transaction isolation level is  SERIALIZABLE . See section  6.7.3   SET TRANSACTION  Syntax .      This is the same as using  --sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,SERIALIZE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY .       1.4.4  Functionality Missing from MySQL              The following functionality is missing in the current version of MySQL.  For a prioritized list indicating when new extensions may be added to MySQL, you should consult   the online MySQL TODO list . That is the latest version of the TODO list in this manual. See section  1.6  MySQL and the future (The TODO) .        1.4.4.1  Sub-selects            MySQL currently only supports sub selects of the form  INSERT ... SELECT ...  and  REPLACE ... SELECT ... . You can however use the function  IN()  in other contexts.      In many cases you can rewrite the query without a sub-select:      SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);      This can be re-written as:      SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;      The queries:   SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2); SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2 where table1.id=table2.id);      Can be rewritten as:      SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id where table2.id IS NULL      For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however this option will not work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with  DELETE  statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins (except in sub-selects).  For this situation there are two options available until subqueries are supported by MySQL.      The first option is to use a procedural programming language (such as Perl or PHP) to submit a  SELECT  query to obtain the primary keys for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct the  DELETE  statement ( DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1, key2, ...) ).      The second option is to use interactive SQL to contruct a set of  DELETE  statements automatically, using the MySQL extension  CONCAT()  (in lieu of the standard  ||  operator). For example:      SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', tab1.pkid, ';')   FROM tab1, tab2  WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;      You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to the  mysql  command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a second instance of the interpreter:      prompt> mysql --skip-column-names mydb < myscript.sql | mysql mydb      MySQL 4.0 supports multi-table deletes that can be used to efficiently delete rows based on information from one table or even from many tables at the same time.       1.4.4.2   SELECT INTO TABLE            MySQL doesn't yet support the Oracle SQL extension:  SELECT ... INTO TABLE ... .  MySQL supports instead the ANSI SQL syntax  INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... , which is basically the same thing. See section  6.4.2.1   INSERT ... SELECT  Syntax .      INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID FROM tblTemp1 WHERE tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID > 100;      Alternatively, you can use  SELECT INTO OUTFILE...  or  CREATE TABLE ... SELECT  to solve your problem.        1.4.4.3  Transactions            As MySQL does nowadays support transactions, the following discussion is only valid if you are only using the non-transaction-safe table types. See section  6.7.1   BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK  Syntax .      The question is often asked, by the curious and the critical, ``Why is MySQL not a transactional database?'' or ``Why does MySQL not support transactions?''      MySQL has made a conscious decision to support another paradigm for data integrity, ``atomic operations.'' It is our thinking and experience that atomic operations offer equal or even better integrity with much better performance. We, nonetheless, appreciate and understand the transactional database paradigm and plan, within the next few releases, to introduce transaction-safe tables on a per table basis. We will be giving our users the possibility to decide if they need the speed of atomic operations or if they need to use transactional features in their applications.      How does one use the features of MySQL to maintain rigorous integrity and how do these features compare with the transactional paradigm?      First, in the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written in a way that is dependent on the calling of ``rollback'' instead of ``commit'' in critical situations, then transactions are more convenient. Moreover, transactions ensure that unfinished updates or corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is saved.      MySQL, in almost all cases, allows you to solve for potential problems by including simple checks before updates and by running simple scripts that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically repair or warn if such occurs. Note that just by using the MySQL log or even adding one extra log, one can normally fix tables perfectly with no data integrity loss.      Moreover, fatal transactional updates can be rewritten to be atomic. In fact,we will go so far as to say that all integrity problems that transactions solve can be done with  LOCK TABLES  or atomic updates, ensuring that you never will get an automatic abort from the database, which is a common problem with transactional databases.      Not even transactions can prevent all loss if the server goes down.  In such cases even a transactional system can lose data.  The difference between different systems lies in just how small the time-lap is where they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only ``secure enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of transactional databases, is reported to sometimes lose data in such situations.      To be safe with MySQL, you only need to have backups and have the update logging turned on.  With this you can recover from any situation that you could with any transactional database.  It is, of course, always good to have backups, independent of which database you use.      The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many users and application developers depend on the ease with which they can code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary, and they may have to do a little more work with MySQL to either think differently or write more. If you are new to the atomic operations paradigm, or more familiar or more comfortable with transactions, do not jump to the conclusion that MySQL has not addressed these issues. Reliability and integrity are foremost in our minds.  Recent estimates indicate that there are more than 1,000,000  mysqld  servers currently running, many of which are in production environments.  We hear very, very seldom from our users that they have lost any data, and in almost all of those cases user error is involved. This is, in our opinion, the best proof of MySQL's stability and reliability.      Lastly, in situations where integrity is of highest importance, MySQL's current features allow for transaction-level or better reliability and integrity. If you lock tables with  LOCK TABLES , all updates will stall until any integrity checks are made.  If you only obtain a read lock (as opposed to a write lock), then reads and inserts are still allowed to happen.  The new inserted records will not be seen by any of the clients that have a  READ  lock until they release their read locks.  With  INSERT DELAYED  you can queue inserts into a local queue, until the locks are released, without having the client wait for the insert to complete. See section  6.4.3   INSERT DELAYED  syntax .      ``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only means that you can be sure that while each specific update is running, no other user can interfere with it, and there will never be an automatic rollback (which can happen on transaction based systems if you are not very careful).  MySQL also guarantees that there will not be any dirty reads.  You can find some example of how to write atomic updates in the commit-rollback section. See section  1.4.6  How to Cope Without  COMMIT / ROLLBACK .      We have thought quite a bit about integrity and performance, and we believe that our atomic operations paradigm allows for both high reliability and extremely high performance, on the order of three to five times the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned of transactional databases. We didn't leave out transactions because they are hard to do. The main reason we went with atomic operations as opposed to transactions is that by doing this we could apply many speed optimizations that would not otherwise have been possible.      Many of our users who have speed foremost in their minds are not at all concerned about transactions. For them transactions are not an issue. For those of our users who are concerned with or have wondered about transactions vis-a-vis MySQL, there is a ``MySQL way'' as we have outlined above.  For those where safety is more important than speed, we recommend them to use the  BDB , or  InnoDB  tables for all their critical data. See section  7  MySQL Table Types .      One final note: We are currently working on a safe replication schema that we believe to be better than any commercial replication system we know of. This system will work most reliably under the atomic operations, non-transactional, paradigm. Stay tuned.        1.4.4.4  Stored Procedures and Triggers                A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure. This provides better performance because the query has to be parsed only once, and less information needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also raise the conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server.      A trigger is a stored procedure that is invoked when a particular event occurs.  For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered each time a record is deleted from a transaction table and that automatically deletes the corresponding customer from a customer table when all his transactions are deleted.      The planned update language will be able to handle stored procedures, but without triggers. Triggers usually slow down everything, even queries for which they are not needed.      To see when MySQL might get stored procedures, see section  1.6  MySQL and the future (The TODO) .        1.4.4.5  Foreign Keys              Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If you want to get results from multiple tables from a  SELECT  statement, you do this by joining tables:      SELECT * from table1,table2 where table1.id = table2.id;      See section  6.4.1.1   JOIN  Syntax . See section  3.5.6  Using Foreign Keys .      The  FOREIGN KEY  syntax in MySQL exists only for compatibility with other SQL vendors'  CREATE TABLE  commands; it doesn't do anything.  The  FOREIGN KEY  syntax without  ON DELETE ...  is mostly used for documentation purposes. Some ODBC applications may use this to produce automatic  WHERE  clauses, but this is usually easy to override.  FOREIGN KEY  is sometimes used as a constraint check, but this check is unnecessary in practice if rows are inserted into the tables in the right order. MySQL only supports these clauses because some applications require them to exist (regardless of whether or not they work).      In MySQL, you can work around the problem of  ON DELETE ...  not being implemented by adding the appropriate  DELETE  statement to an application when you delete records from a table that has a foreign key. In practice this is as quick (in some cases quicker) and much more portable than using foreign keys.      In the near future we will extend the  FOREIGN KEY  implementation so that at least the information will be saved in the table specification file and may be retrieved by  mysqldump  and ODBC. At a later stage we will implement the foreign key constraints for application that can't easily be coded to avoid them.        1.4.4.6  Reasons NOT to Use Foreign Keys constraints            There are so many problems with foreign key constraints that we don't know where to start:          Foreign key constraints make life very complicated, because the foreign key definitions must be stored in a database and implementing them would destroy the whole ``nice approach'' of using files that can be moved, copied, and removed.     The speed impact is terrible for  INSERT  and  UPDATE  statements, and in this case almost all  FOREIGN KEY  constraint checks are useless because you usually insert records in the right tables in the right order, anyway.     There is also a need to hold locks on many more tables when updating one table, because the side effects can cascade through the entire database. It's MUCH faster to delete records from one table first and subsequently delete them from the other tables.     You can no longer restore a table by doing a full delete from the table and then restoring all records (from a new source or from a backup).     If you use foreign key constraints you can't dump and restore tables unless you do so in a very specific order.     It's very easy to do ``allowed'' circular definitions that make the tables impossible to re-create each table with a single create statement, even if the definition works and is usable.     It's very easy to overlook  FOREIGN KEY ... ON DELETE  rules when one codes an application. It's not unusual that one loses a lot of important information just because a wrong or misused  ON DELETE  rule.      The only nice aspect of  FOREIGN KEY  is that it gives ODBC and some other client programs the ability to see how a table is connected and to use this to show connection diagrams and to help in building applications.      MySQL will soon store  FOREIGN KEY  definitions so that a client can ask for and receive an answer about how the original connection was made. The current  `.frm'  file format does not have any place for it.  At a later stage we will implement the foreign key constraints for application that can't easily be coded to avoid them.        1.4.4.7  Views            MySQL doesn't yet support views, but we plan to implement these to about 4.1.      Views are mostly useful for letting users access a set of relations as one table (in read-only mode).  Many SQL databases don't allow one to update any rows in a view, but you have to do the updates in the separate tables.      As MySQL is mostly used in applications and on web system where the application writer has full control on the database usage, most of our users haven't regarded views to be very important. (At least no one has been interested enough in this to be prepared to finance the implementation of views).      One doesn't need views in MySQL to restrict access to columns as MySQL has a very sophisticated privilege system. See section  4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System .        1.4.4.8   `--'  as the Start of a Comment              Some other SQL databases use  `--'  to start comments. MySQL has  `#'  as the start comment character, even if the  mysql  command-line tool removes all lines that start with  `--' . You can also use the C comment style  /* this is a comment */  with MySQL. See section  6.1.5  Comment Syntax .      MySQL Version 3.23.3 and above supports the  `--'  comment style only if the comment is followed by a space.  This is because this degenerate comment style has caused many problems with automatically generated SQL queries that have used something like the following code, where we automatically insert the value of the payment for  !payment! :      UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!      What do you think will happen when the value of  payment  is negative?      Because  1--1  is legal in SQL, we think it is terrible that  `--'  means start comment.      In MySQL Version 3.23 you can, however, use:  1-- This is a comment       The following discussion only concerns you if you are running a MySQL version earlier than Version 3.23:      If you have a SQL program in a text file that contains  `--'  comments you should use:      shell> replace "" --"" "" #"" < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \          | mysql database      instead of the usual:      shell> mysql database < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql      You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the  `--'  comments to  `#'  comments:      shell> replace "" --"" "" #"" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql      Change them back with this command:      shell> replace "" #"" "" --"" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql       1.4.5  What Standards Does MySQL Follow?     Entry level SQL92. ODBC levels 0-2.        1.4.6  How to Cope Without  COMMIT / ROLLBACK                        The following mostly applies only for  ISAM ,  MyISAM , and  HEAP  tables. If you only use transaction-safe tables ( BDB , or  InnoDB  tables) in an an update, you can do  COMMIT  and  ROLLBACK  also with MySQL. See section  6.7.1   BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK  Syntax .      The problem with handling  COMMIT - ROLLBACK  efficiently with the above table types would require a completely different table layout than MySQL uses today.  The table type would also need extra threads that do automatic cleanups on the tables, and the disk usage would be much higher. This would make these table types about 2-4 times slower than they are today.      For the moment, we prefer implementing the SQL server language (something like stored procedures). With this you would very seldom really need  COMMIT - ROLLBACK.  This would also give much better performance.      Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of  LOCK TABLES , and you don't need cursors when you can update records on the fly.      We at TcX had a greater need for a real fast database than a 100% general database. Whenever we find a way to implement these features without any speed loss, we will probably do it. For the moment, there are many more important things to do. Check the TODO for how we prioritize things at the moment. (Customers with higher levels of support can alter this, so things may be reprioritized.)      The current problem is actually  ROLLBACK . Without  ROLLBACK , you can do any kind of  COMMIT  action with  LOCK TABLES . To support  ROLLBACK  with the above table types, MySQL would have to be changed to store all old records that were updated and revert everything back to the starting point if  ROLLBACK  was issued. For simple cases, this isn't that hard to do (the current  isamlog  could be used for this purpose), but it would be much more difficult to implement  ROLLBACK  for  ALTER/DROP/CREATE TABLE .      To avoid using  ROLLBACK , you can use the following strategy:          Use  LOCK TABLES ...  to lock all the tables you want to access.    Test conditions.    Update if everything is okay.    Use  UNLOCK TABLES  to release your locks.      This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with possible  ROLLBACK s, although not always. The only situation this solution doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the middle of an update. In this case, all locks will be released but some of the updates may not have been executed.      You can also use functions to update records in a single operation. You can get a very efficient application by using the following techniques:        Modify fields relative to their current value.   Update only those fields that actually have changed.       For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of the changed data, or data that depend on the changed data, has changed compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the  WHERE  clause in the  UPDATE  statement. If the record wasn't updated, we give the client a message: ""Some of the data you have changed have been changed by another user"". Then we show the old row versus the new row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record he should use.      This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually even better, because we only update some of the columns, using values that are relative to their current values.  This means that typical  UPDATE  statements look something like these:      UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+'relative change';  UPDATE customer   SET     customer_date='current_date',     address='new address',     phone='new phone',     money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us+'new_money'   WHERE     customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';      As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client has changed the values in the  pay_back  or  money_he_owes_us  columns.          In many cases, users have wanted  ROLLBACK  and/or  LOCK TABLES  for the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables. This can be handled much more efficiently by using an  AUTO_INCREMENT  column and either the SQL function  LAST_INSERT_ID()  or the C API function  mysql_insert_id() . See section  8.4.3.126   mysql_insert_id() .        At MySQL AB, we have never had any need for row-level locking because we have always been able to code around it. Some cases really need row locking, but they are very few. If you want row-level locking, you can use a flag column in the table and do something like this:      UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;      MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was found and  row_flag  wasn't already 1 in the original row.      You can think of it as MySQL changed the above query to:      UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID and row_flag <> 1;       1.4.7  Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL                  The following problems are known and have a very high priority to get fixed:           ANALYZE TABLE  on a BDB table may in some case make the table unusable until one has restarted  mysqld .  When this happens you will see errors like the following in the MySQL error file:    001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log       Don't execute  ALTER TABLE  on a  BDB  table on which you are running not completed multi-statement transactions. (The transaction will probably be ignored).      ANALYZE TABLE ,  OPTIMIZE TABLE  and  REPAIR TABLE  may cause problems on tables for which you are using  INSERT DELAYED .     Doing a  LOCK TABLE ..  and  FLUSH TABLES ..  doesn't guarantee that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the table.     BDB tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many BDB tables in a database, it will take a long time to use the  mysql  client on the database if you are not using the  -A  option or if you are using  rehash . This is especially notable when you have a big table cache.     Th current replication protocol cannot deal with  LOAD DATA INFILE  and line terminator characters of more than 1 character.      The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:          For the moment  MATCH  only works with  SELECT  statements.     When using  SET CHARACTER SET , one can't use translated characters in database, table and column names.      DELETE FROM merge_table  used without a  WHERE  will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the mapped tables     You cannot build in another directory when using MIT-pthreads. Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not likely to fix this.      BLOB  values can't ``reliably'' be used in  GROUP BY  or  ORDER BY  or  DISTINCT . Only the first  max_sort_length  bytes (default 1024) are used when comparing  BLOB bs in these cases. This can be changed with the  -O max_sort_length  option to  mysqld . A workaround for most cases is to use a substring:  SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name .     Calculation is done with  BIGINT  or  DOUBLE  (both are normally 64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with  BIGINT  precision,  IF , and  ELT()  with  BIGINT  or  DOUBLE  precision and the rest with  DOUBLE  precision.  One should try to avoid using bigger unsigned long long values than 63 bits (9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit fields!     All string columns, except  BLOB  and  TEXT  columns, automatically have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For  CHAR  types this is okay, and may be regarded as a feature according to ANSI SQL92. The bug is that in MySQL,  VARCHAR  columns are treated the same way.     You can only have up to 255  ENUM  and  SET  columns in one table.      safe_mysqld  re-directs all messages from  mysqld  to the  mysqld  log.  One problem with this is that if you execute  mysqladmin refresh  to close and reopen the log,  stdout  and  stderr  are still redirected to the old log. If you use  --log  extensively, you should edit  safe_mysqld  to log to  `'hostname'.err'  instead of  `'hostname'.log'  so you can easily reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and executing  mysqladmin refresh .     In the  UPDATE  statement, columns are updated from left to right.  If  you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value instead of the original value. For example:    mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;    This will update  KEY  with  2  instead of with  1 .     You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query. For example, the following doesn't work.    select * from temporary_table, temporary_table as t2;        RENAME  doesn't work with  TEMPORARY  tables.     The optimizer may handle  DISTINCT  differently if you are using 'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in normal queries hidden columns doesn't participate in the  DISTINCT  comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never compare the hidden columns when executing  DISTINCT   An example of this is:    SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id DESC;    and    SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id, FROM band_downloads,band_mp3 WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9 AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;    In the second case you may in MySQL 3.23.x get two identical rows in the result set (because the hidden 'id' column may differ).  Note that the this only happens for queries where you don't have the ORDER BY columns in the result, something that is you are not allowed to do in ANSI SQL.     Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that doesn't support transactions (and thus can't  rollback  data) some things behaves a little different in MySQL than in other SQL servers: (This is just to ensure that MySQL never need to do a rollback for a SQL command).  This may be a little awkward at times as column Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that don't support transactions, and thus can't  rollback  data, some things behave a little differently in MySQL than in other SQL servers. This is just to ensure that MySQL never need to do a rollback for a SQL command.  This may be a little awkward at times as column values must be checked in the application, but this will actually give you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL to do some optimizations that otherwise would be very hard to do.  If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL will, instead of doing a rollback, store the  best possible value  in the column:        If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical column, MySQL will instead store the smallest or biggest possible value in the column.     If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number into a numerical column, MySQL will store 0 into it.     If you try to store  NULL  into a column that doesn't take  NULL  values, MySQL will store 0 or  ''  (empty string) in it instead. (This behavior can, however, be changed with the -DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compile option).     MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into  DATE  and  DATETIME  columns. (Like 2000-02-31 or 2000-02-00). If the date is totally wrong, MySQL will store the special 0000-00-00 date value in the column.     If you set an  enum  to an unsupported value, it will be set to the error value 'empty string', with numeric value 0.       If you execute a  PROCEDURE  on a query that returns an empty set, in some cases the  PROCEDURE  will not transform the columns.     Creation of a table of type  MERGE  doesn't check if the underlying tables are of compatible types.     MySQL can't yet handle  NaN ,  -Inf  and  Inf  values in double. Using these will cause problems when trying to export and import data. We should as an intermediate solution change  NaN  to  NULL  (if possible) and  -Inf  and  Inf  to the Minimum respective maximum possible  double  value.      LIMIT  on negative numbers are treated as big positive numbers.    If you use  ALTER TABLE  to first add an  UNIQUE  index to a table used in a  MERGE  table and then use  ALTER TABLE  to add a normal index on the  MERGE  table, the key order will be different for the tables if there was an old not-unique key in the table. This is because  ALTER TABLE  puts  UNIQUE  keys before normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.      The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:          You can get a hung thread if you do a  DROP TABLE  on a table that is one among many tables that is locked with  LOCK TABLES .     In the following case you can get a core dump:        Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.      LOCK table  with  WRITE       FLUSH TABLES        Before MySQL Version 3.23.2 an  UPDATE  that updated a key with a  WHERE  on the same key may have failed because the key was used to search for records and the same row may have been found multiple times:    UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY > 100;    A workaround is to use:    mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 > 100;    This will work because MySQL will not use index on expressions in the  WHERE  clause.     Before MySQL Version 3.23, all numeric types where treated as fixed-point fields. That means you had to specify how many decimals a floating-point field shall have. All results were returned with the correct number of decimals.      For platform-specific bugs, see the sections about compiling and porting.        1.5  How MySQL Compares to Other Databases               This section compares MySQL to other popular databases.        This section has been written by the MySQL developers, so it should be read with that in mind.  There are no factual errors contained in this section that we know of.  If you find something which you believe to be an error, please contact us about it at  docs@mysql.com .      For a list of all supported limits, functions, and types, see the  crash-me  Web page at   http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php .        1.5.1  How MySQL Compares to  mSQL       Performance    For a true comparison of speed, consult the growing MySQL benchmark suite. See section  5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite .  Because there is no thread creation overhead, a small parser, few features, and simple security,  mSQL  should be quicker at:        Tests that perform repeated connects and disconnects, running a very simple query during each connection.      INSERT  operations into very simple tables with few columns and keys.      CREATE TABLE  and  DROP TABLE .      SELECT  on something that isn't an index. (A table scan is very easy.)    Because these operations are so simple, it is hard to be better at them when you have a higher startup overhead. After the connection is established, MySQL should perform much better.  On the other hand, MySQL is much faster than  mSQL  (and most other SQL implementations) on the following:        Complex  SELECT  operations.     Retrieving large results (MySQL has a better, faster, and safer protocol).     Tables with variable-length strings, because MySQL has more efficient handling and can have indexes on  VARCHAR  columns.     Handling tables with many columns.     Handling tables with large record lengths.      SELECT  with many expressions.      SELECT  on large tables.     Handling many connections at the same time. MySQL is fully multi-threaded. Each connection has its own thread, which means that no thread has to wait for another (unless a thread is modifying a table another thread wants to access). In  mSQL , once one connection is established, all others must wait until the first has finished, regardless of whether the connection is running a query that is short or long. When the first connection terminates, the next can be served, while all the others wait again, etc.     Joins.  mSQL  can become pathologically slow if you change the order of tables in a  SELECT . In the benchmark suite, a time more than 15000 times slower than MySQL was seen.  This is due to  mSQL 's lack of a join optimizer to order tables in the optimal order. However, if you put the tables in exactly the right order in  mSQL 2 and the  WHERE  is simple and uses index columns, the join will be relatively fast! See section  5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite .      ORDER BY  and  GROUP BY .      DISTINCT .     Using  TEXT  or  BLOB  columns.     SQL Features        GROUP BY  and  HAVING .   mSQL  does not support  GROUP BY  at all. MySQL supports a full  GROUP BY  with both  HAVING  and the following functions:  COUNT() ,  AVG() ,  MIN() ,  MAX() ,  SUM() , and  STD() .   COUNT(*)  is optimized to return very quickly if the  SELECT  retrieves from one table, no other columns are retrieved, and there is no  WHERE  clause.   MIN()  and  MAX()  may take string arguments.   INSERT  and  UPDATE  with calculations.  MySQL can do calculations in an  INSERT  or  UPDATE . For example:    mysql> UPDATE SET x=x*10+y WHERE x<20;     Aliasing.  MySQL has column aliasing.   Qualifying column names.  In MySQL, if a column name is unique among the tables used in a query, you do not have to use the full qualifier.   SELECT  with functions.  MySQL has many functions (too many to list here; see section  6.3  Functions for Use in  SELECT  and  WHERE  Clauses ).      Disk Space Efficiency    That is, how small can you make your tables?  MySQL has very precise types, so you can create tables that take very little space. An example of a useful MySQL datatype is the  MEDIUMINT  that is 3 bytes long. If you have 100,000,000 records, saving even one byte per record is very important.   mSQL2  has a more limited set of column types, so it is more difficult to get small tables.   Stability    This is harder to judge objectively. For a discussion of MySQL stability, see section  1.1.7  How Stable Is MySQL? .  We have no experience with  mSQL  stability, so we cannot say anything about that.   Price    Another important issue is the license. MySQL has a more flexible license than  mSQL , and is also less expensive than  mSQL .  Whichever product you choose to use, remember to at least consider paying for a license or e-mail support.  (You are required to get a license if you include MySQL with a product that you sell, of course.)   Perl Interfaces    MySQL has basically the same interfaces to Perl as  mSQL  with some added features.   JDBC (Java)    MySQL currently has a lot of different JDBC drivers:        The mm driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Mark Matthews  mmatthew@ecn.purdue.edu .  This is released under the LGPL.     The Resin driver. This is a commercial JDBC driver released under open source.   http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp      The gwe driver: A Java interface by GWE technologies (not supported anymore).     The jms driver: An improved gwe driver by Xiaokun Kelvin ZHU  X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk  (not supported anymore).     The twz driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Terrence W. Zellers  zellert@voicenet.com .  This is commercial but is free for private and educational use (not supported anymore).    The recommended driver is the mm driver. The Resin driver may also be good (at least the benchmarks looks good), but we haven't received that much information about this yet.  We know that  mSQL  has a JDBC driver, but we have too little experience with it to compare.   Rate of Development    MySQL has a very small team of developers, but we are quite used to coding C and C++ very rapidly. Because threads, functions,  GROUP BY , and so on are still not implemented in  mSQL , it has a lot of catching up to do. To get some perspective on this, you can view the  mSQL   `HISTORY'  file for the last year and compare it with the News section of the MySQL Reference Manual (see section  F  MySQL change history ). It should be pretty obvious which one has developed most rapidly.   Utility Programs    Both  mSQL  and MySQL have many interesting third-party tools. Because it is very easy to port upward (from  mSQL  to MySQL), almost all the interesting applications that are available for  mSQL  are also available for MySQL.  MySQL comes with a simple  msql2mysql  program that fixes differences in spelling between  mSQL  and MySQL for the most-used C API functions. For example, it changes instances of  msqlConnect()  to  mysql_connect() . Converting a client program from  mSQL  to MySQL usually takes a couple of minutes.       1.5.1.1  How to Convert  mSQL  Tools for MySQL                According to our experience, it would just take a few hours to convert tools such as  msql-tcl  and  msqljava  that use the  mSQL  C API so that they work with the MySQL C API.      The conversion procedure is:          Run the shell script  msql2mysql  on the source. This requires the  replace  program, which is distributed with MySQL.     Compile.     Fix all compiler errors.      Differences between the  mSQL  C API and the MySQL C API are:          MySQL uses a  MYSQL  structure as a connection type ( mSQL  uses an  int ).      mysql_connect()  takes a pointer to a  MYSQL  structure as a parameter.  It is easy to define one globally or to use  malloc()  to get one.   mysql_connect()  also takes two parameters for specifying the  user and password.  You may set these to  NULL, NULL  for default use.      mysql_error()  takes the  MYSQL  structure as a parameter. Just add the parameter to your old  msql_error()  code if you are porting old code.     MySQL returns an error number and a text error message for all errors.  mSQL  returns only a text error message.     Some incompatibilities exist as a result of MySQL supporting multiple connections to the server from the same process.       1.5.1.2  How  mSQL  and MySQL Client/Server Communications Protocols Differ              There are enough differences that it is impossible (or at least not easy) to support both.      The most significant ways in which the MySQL protocol differs from the  mSQL  protocol are listed below:          A message buffer may contain many result rows.     The message buffers are dynamically enlarged if the query or the result is bigger than the current buffer, up to a configurable server and client limit.     All packets are numbered to catch duplicated or missing packets.     All column values are sent in ASCII. The lengths of columns and rows are sent in packed binary coding (1, 2, or 3 bytes).     MySQL can read in the result unbuffered (without having to store the full set in the client).     If a single read/write takes more than 30 seconds, the server closes the connection.     If a connection is idle for 8 hours, the server closes the connection.       1.5.1.3  How  mSQL  2.0 SQL Syntax Differs from MySQL      Column types         MySQL    Has the following additional types (among others; see section  6.5.3   CREATE TABLE  Syntax ):        ENUM  type for one of a set of strings.     SET  type for many of a set of strings.     BIGINT  type for 64-bit integers.        MySQL also supports the following additional type attributes:        UNSIGNED  option for integer columns.     ZEROFILL  option for integer columns.     AUTO_INCREMENT  option for integer columns that are a  PRIMARY KEY . See section  8.4.3.126   mysql_insert_id() .     DEFAULT  value for all columns.     mSQL2     mSQL  column types correspond to the MySQL types shown below:    mSQL   type     Corresponding MySQL type     CHAR(len)     CHAR(len)     TEXT(len)     TEXT(len) .  len  is the maximal length. And  LIKE  works.    INT     INT . With many more options!    REAL     REAL . Or  FLOAT . Both 4- and 8-byte versions are available.    UINT     INT UNSIGNED     DATE     DATE . Uses ANSI SQL format rather than  mSQL 's own format.    TIME     TIME     MONEY     DECIMAL(12,2) . A fixed-point value with two decimals.           Index Creation         MySQL    Indexes may be specified at table creation time with the  CREATE TABLE  statement.  mSQL    Indexes must be created after the table has been created, with separate  CREATE INDEX  statements.       To Insert a Unique Identifier into a Table         MySQL    Use  AUTO_INCREMENT  as a column type specifier. See section  8.4.3.126   mysql_insert_id() .  mSQL    Create a  SEQUENCE  on a table and select the  _seq  column.       To Obtain a Unique Identifier for a Row         MySQL    Add a  PRIMARY KEY  or  UNIQUE  key to the table and use this. New in Version 3.23.11: If the  PRIMARY  or  UNIQUE  key consists of only one column and this is of type integer, one can also refer to it as  _rowid .  mSQL    Use the  _rowid  column. Observe that  _rowid  may change over time depending on many factors.       To Get the Time a Column Was Last Modified         MySQL    Add a  TIMESTAMP  column to the table. This column is automatically set to the current date and time for  INSERT  or  UPDATE  statements if you don't give the column a value or if you give it a  NULL  value.   mSQL    Use the  _timestamp  column.       NULL  Value Comparisons         MySQL    MySQL follows ANSI SQL, and a comparison with  NULL  is always  NULL .  mSQL    In  mSQL ,  NULL = NULL  is TRUE.  You must change  =NULL  to  IS NULL  and  <>NULL  to  IS NOT NULL  when porting old code from  mSQL  to MySQL.       String Comparisons         MySQL    Normally, string comparisons are performed in case-independent fashion with the sort order determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default).  If you don't like this, declare your columns with the  BINARY  attribute, which causes comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the MySQL server host.  mSQL    All string comparisons are performed in case-sensitive fashion with sorting in ASCII order.       Case-insensitive Searching         MySQL     LIKE  is a case-insensitive or case-sensitive operator, depending on the columns involved. If possible, MySQL uses indexes if the  LIKE  argument doesn't start with a wild-card character.  mSQL    Use  CLIKE .       Handling of Trailing Spaces         MySQL    Strips all spaces at the end of  CHAR  and  VARCHAR  columns. Use a  TEXT  column if this behavior is not desired.  mSQL    Retains trailing space.       WHERE  Clauses         MySQL    MySQL correctly prioritizes everything ( AND  is evaluated before  OR ). To get  mSQL  behavior in MySQL, use parentheses (as shown in an example below).  mSQL    Evaluates everything from left to right. This means that some logical calculations with more than three arguments cannot be expressed in any way. It also means you must change some queries when you upgrade to MySQL. You do this easily by adding parentheses.  Suppose you have the following  mSQL  query:   mysql> SELECT * FROM table WHERE a=1 AND b=2 OR a=3 AND b=4;    To make MySQL evaluate this the way that  mSQL  would, you must add parentheses:   mysql> SELECT * FROM table WHERE (a=1 AND (b=2 OR (a=3 AND (b=4))));          Access Control         MySQL    Has tables to store grant (permission) options per user, host, and database. See section  4.2.5  How the Privilege System Works .  mSQL    Has a file  `mSQL.acl'  in which you can grant read/write privileges for users.           1.5.2  How MySQL Compares to PostgreSQL            When reading the following, please note that both products are continually evolving.  We at MySQL AB and the PostgreSQL developers are both working on making our respective database as good as possible, so we are both a  serious choice to any commercial database.      The following comparison is made by us at MySQL AB.  We have tried to be as accurate and fair as possible, but because we don't have a full knowledge of all PostgreSQL features while we know MySQL througly, we may have got some things wrong.  We will however correct these when they come to our attention.      We would first like to note that PostgreSQL and MySQL are both widely used products, but with different design goals, even if we are both striving to be ANSI SQL compatible.  This means that for some applications MySQL is  more suited, while for others PostgreSQL is more suited.  When choosing  which database to use, you should first check if the database's feature set satisfies your application.  If you need raw speed, MySQL is probably your best choice.  If you need some of the extra features that only PostgreSQL can offer, you should use  PostgreSQL .               1.5.2.1  MySQL and PostgreSQL development strategies     When adding things to MySQL we take pride to do an optimal, definite solution.  The code should be so good that we shouldn't have any need to change it in the foreseeable future.  We also do not like to sacrifice speed for features but instead will do our utmost to find a solution that will give maximal throughput.  This means that development will take a little longer, but the end result will be well worth this.  This kind of development is only possible because all server code are checked by one of a few (currently two) persons before it's included in the MySQL server.      We at MySQL AB believe in frequent releases to be able to push out new features quickly to our users.  Because of this we do a new small release about every three weeks, and a major branch every year.  All releases are throughly tested with our testing tools on a lot of different platforms.      PostgreSQL is based on a kernel with lots of contributors. In this setup it makes sense to prioritize adding a lot of new features, instead of implementing them optimally, because one can always optimize things later if there arises a need for this.      Another big difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL is that nearly all of the code in the MySQL server are coded by developers that are employed by MySQL AB and are still working on the server code. The exceptions are the transaction engines, and the regexp library.      This is in sharp contrast to the PostgreSQL code where the majority of the code is coded by a big group of people with different backgrounds. It was only recently that the PostgreSQL developers announced that their current developer group had finally had time to take a look at all the code in the current PostgreSQL release.      Both of the above development methods has it's own merits and drawbacks. We here at MySQL AB think of course that our model is better because our model gives better code consistency, more optimal and reusable code, and in our opinion, fewer bugs.  Because we are the authors of the MySQL server code, we are better able to coordinate new features and releases.        1.5.2.2  Featurewise Comparison of MySQL and PostgreSQL            On the   crash-me  page you can find a list of those database constructs and limits that one can detect automatically with a program.  Note however that a lot of the numerical limits may be changed with startup options for respective database.  The above web page is however extremely useful when you want to ensure that your applications works with many different databases or when you want to convert your application from one datbase to another.      MySQL offers the following advantages over PostgreSQL:           MySQL  is generally much faster than PostgreSQL. See section  1.5.2.3  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL .     MySQL has a much larger user base than PostgreSQL, therefor the code is more tested and has historically been more stable than PostgreSQL.  MySQL is the much more used in production environments than PostgreSQL, mostly thanks to that MySQL AB, formerly TCX DataKonsult AB, has provided top quality commercial support for MySQL from the day it was released, whereas until recently PostgreSQL was unsupported.     MySQL works better on Windows than PostgreSQL does.  MySQL runs as a native Windows application (a service on NT/Win2000/WinXP), while PostgreSQL is run under the cygwin emulation.  We have heard that PostgreSQL is not yet that stable on Windows but we haven't been able to verify this ourselves.     MySQL has more APIs to other languages and is supported by more existing programs than PostgreSQL.  See section  D  Contributed Programs .     MySQL works on 24/7 heavy duty systems.  In most circumstances you never have to run any cleanups on MySQL.  PostgreSQL doesn't yet support 24/7 systems because you have to run  VACUUM()  once in a while to reclaim space from  UPDATE  and  DELETE  commands and to perform statistics analyzes that are critical to get good performance with PostgreSQL.   VACUUM()  is also needed after adding a lot of new rows to a table.  On a busy system with lots of changes,  VACUUM()  must be run very frequently, in the worst cases even  many times a day.  During the  VACUUM()  run, which may take hours  if the database is big, the database is from a production standpoint, practically dead.  The PostgreSQL team has fixing this on their TODO, but we assume that this is not an easy thing to fix permanently.     A working, tested replication feature used by sites like:     Yahoo Finance ( http://finance.yahoo.com )   Mobile.de ( http://www.mobile.de/ )   Slashdot ( http://www.slashdot.org )        Included in the MySQL distribution are two different testing suites,   `mysql-test-run'  and   crash-me , as well as a benchmark suite.  The test system is actively updated with code to test each new feature and almost all repeatable bugs that have come to our attention.  We test MySQL with these on a lot of platforms before every release.  These tests are more sophisticated than anything we have  seen from PostgreSQL, and they ensures that the MySQL is kept to a high standard.     There are far more books in print about MySQL than about PostgreSQL. O'Reilly, Sams, Que, and New Riders are all major publishers with books about MySQL.  All MySQL features are also documented in the MySQL on-line manual, because when a new feature is implemented, the MySQL developers  are required to document it before it's included in the source.     MySQL supports more of the standard ODBC functions than  PostgreSQL .     MySQL has a much more sophisticated  ALTER TABLE .     MySQL has support for tables without transactions for applications that  need all speed they can get. The tables may be memory based,  HEAP  tables or disk based  MyISAM .  See section  7  MySQL Table Types .     MySQL has support for two different table handlers that support transactions,  BerkeleyDB  and  InnoDB .  Because every  transaction engine performs differently under different conditions, this  gives the application writer more options to find an optimal solution for his or her setup.  See section  7  MySQL Table Types .      MERGE  tables gives you a unique way to instantly make a view over a set of identical tables and use these as one.  This is perfect for systems where you have log files that you order for example by month. See section  7.2  MERGE Tables .     The option to compress read-only tables, but still have direct access to the rows in the table, gives you better performance by minimizing disk reads.  This is very useful when you are archiving things. See section  4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator .     MySQL has internal support for fulltext search. See section  6.8  MySQL Full-text Search .     You can access many databases from the same connection (depending of course on your privileges).     MySQL is coded from the start to be multi-threaded while PostgreSQL uses processes.  Context switching and access to common storage areas is much  faster between threads than between separate processes, this gives MySQL a big speed advantage in multi-user applications and also makes it easier for MySQL to take full advantage of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems.     MySQL has a much more sophisticated privilege system than PostgreSQL.   While PostgreSQL only supports  INSERT ,  SELECT , and  UPDATE/DELETE  grants per user on a database or a table, MySQL allows you to define a full set of different privileges on database, table and  column level.  MySQL also allows you to specify the privilege on host and  user combinations.  See section  4.3.1   GRANT  and  REVOKE  Syntax .     MySQL supports a compressed client/server protocol which improves  performance over slow links.     MySQL employs a ``table handler'' concept, and is the only relational  database we know of built around this concept.  This allows different  low-level table types to be swapped into the SQL engine, and each table  type can be optimized for different performance characteristics.     All MySQL table types (except  InnoDB ) are implemented as files (one table per file), which makes it really easy to backup, move, delete and even symlink databases and tables, even when the server is down.     Tools to repair and optimize  MyISAM  tables (the most common MySQL table type).  A repair tool is only needed when a physical corruption of a data file happens, usually from a hardware failure.  It allows a  majority of the data to be recovered.     Upgrading MySQL is painless.  When you are upgrading MySQL, you don't need to dump/restore your data, as you have to do with most PostgreSQL upgrades.      Drawbacks with MySQL compared to PostgreSQL:          The transaction support in MySQL is not yet as well tested as PostgreSQL's system.     Because MySQL uses threads, which are not yet flawless on many OSes, one must either use binaries from  http://www.mysql.com/downloads , or carefully follow our instructions on  http://www.mysql.com/doc/I/n/Installing_source.html  to get an optimal binary that works in all cases.     Table locking, as used by the non-transactional  MyISAM  tables, is in many cases faster than page locks, row locks or versioning.  The drawback however is that if one doesn't take into account how table locks work, a single long-running query can block a table for updates for a long time. This can usable be avoided when designing the application.  If not, one can always switch the trouble table to use one of the transactional table types. See section  5.3.2  Table Locking Issues .     With UDF (user defined functions) one can extend MySQL with both normal  SQL functions and aggregates, but this is not yet as easy or as flexible as in PostgreSQL.  See section  9.1  Adding New Functions to MySQL .     Updates and deletes that run over multiple tables is harder to do in MySQL. This will, hoever, be fixed in MySQL 4.0 with multi-table  DELETE  and multi-table  UPDATE  and in MySQL 4.1 with subselects.      PostgreSQL currently offers the following advantages over MySQL:      Note that because we know the MySQL road map, we have included in the following table the version when MySQL should support this feature. Unfortunately we couldn't do this for previous comparison, because we  don't know the PostgreSQL roadmap.       Feature     MySQL version     Subselects   4.1    Foreign keys   4.0 and 4.1    Views   4.2    Stored procedures   4.1    Extensible type system   Not planned    Unions   4.0    Full join   4.0 or 4.1    Triggers   4.1    Constrainst   4.1    Cursors   4.1 or 4.2    Extensible index types like R-trees   R-trees are planned for 4.2    Inherited tables   Not planned        Other reasons to use PostgreSQL:          Standard usage in PostgreSQL is closer to ANSI SQL in some cases.     One can speed up PostgreSQL by coding things as stored procedures.     PostgreSQL has a bigger team of developers that contribute to the server.      Drawbacks with PostgreSQL compared to MySQL:           VACUUM()  makes PostgreSQL hard to use in a 24/7 environment.     Only transactional tables.     Much slower  INSERT ,  DELETE , and  UPDATE .      For a complete list of drawbacks, you should also examine the first table in this section.        1.5.2.3  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL            The only open source benchmark that we know of that can be used to benchmark MySQL and PostgreSQL (and other databases) is our own. It can be found at  http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html .      We have many times asked the PostgreSQL developers and some PostgreSQL users to help us extend this benchmark to make it the definitive benchmark for databases, but unfortunately we haven't gotten any feedback for this.      We the MySQL developers have, because of this, spent a lot of hours to get maximum performance from PostgreSQL for the benchmarks, but because we  don't know PostgreSQL intimately, we are sure that there are things that  we have missed.  We have on the benchmark page documented exactly how we  did run the benchmark so that it should be easy for anyone to repeat and verify our results.      The benchmarks are usually run with and without the  --fast  option. When run with  --fast  we are trying to use every trick the server can do to get the code to execute as fast as possible.  The idea is that the normal run should show how the server would work in a default setup and  the  --fast  run shows how the server would do if the application  developer would use extensions in the server to make his application run faster.      When running with PostgreSQL and  --fast  we do a  VACUUM()  after every major table  UPDATE  and  DROP TABLE  to make the database in perfect shape for the following  SELECT s.  The time for  VACUUM()  is measured separately.      When running with PostgreSQL 7.1.1 we could, however, not run with  --fast  because during the  INSERT  test, the postmaster (the PostgreSQL deamon) died and the database was so corrupted that it was impossible to restart postmaster.   After this happened twice, we decided to postpone the  --fast  test until next PostgreSQL release.  The  details about the machine we run the benchmark can be found on the  benchmark page.      Before going to the other benchmarks we know of, we would like to give some background on benchmarks:      It's very easy to write a test that shows ANY database to be best database in the world, by just restricting the test to something the database is very good at and not test anything that the database is not good at.  If one after this publishes the result with a single figure, things are even easier.      This would be like us measuring the speed of MySQL compared to PostgreSQL by looking at the summary time of the MySQL benchmarks on our web page. Based on this MySQL would be more than 40 times faster than PostgreSQL,  something that is of course not true.  We could make things even worse  by just taking the test where PostgreSQL performs worst and claim that  MySQL is more than 2000 times faster than PostgreSQL.      The case is that MySQL does a lot of optimizations that PostgreSQL doesn't do. This is of course also true the other way around.  An SQL optimizer is a very complex thing, and a company could spend years on just making the optimizer faster and faster.      When looking at the benchmark results you should look for things that you do in your application and just use these results to decide which database would be best suited for your application.  The benchmark results also shows things a particular database is not good at and should give you a notion about things to avoid and what you may have to do in other ways.      We know of two benchmark tests that claims that PostgreSQL performs better  than MySQL.  These both where multi-user tests, a test that we here at  MySQL AB haven't had time to write and include in the benchmark suite,  mainly because it's a big task to do this in a manner that is fair against all databases.      One is the benchmark paid for by Great Bridge, which you can read about at:  http://www.greatbridge.com/about/press.php?content_id=4 .      This is the probably worst benchmark we have ever seen anyone conduct.  This was not only tuned to only test what PostgreSQL is absolutely best at, it  was also totally unfair against every other database involved in the test.       NOTE :  We know that not even some of the main PostgreSQL developers did like the way Great Bridge conducted the benchmark, so we don't blame them for the way the benchmark was made.      This benchmark has been condemned in a lot of postings and newsgroups so we will here just shortly repeat some things that where wrong with it.          The tests were run with an expensive commercial tool, that makes it impossible for an open source company like us to verify the benchmarks, or even check how the benchmarks were really done.  The tool is not even a true benchmark tool, but an application/setup testing tool.  To refer this as a ``standard'' benchmark tool is to stretch the truth a long way.     Great Bridge admitted that they had optimized the PostgreSQL database (with  VACUUM()  before the test) and tuned the startup for the tests, something they hadn't done for any of the other databases involved.  To say ``This process optimizes indexes and frees up disk space a bit.  The optimized indexes boost performance by some margin.''  Our benchmarks clearly indicate that the difference in running a lot of selects on a database with and without  VACUUM()  can easily differ by a factor of ten.     The test results were also strange.  The AS3AP test documentation mentions that the test does ``selections, simple joins, projections,  aggregates, one-tuple updates, and bulk updates''.  PostgreSQL is good at doing  SELECT s and  JOIN s (especially  after a  VACUUM() ), but doesn't perform as well on  INSERT s or  UPDATE s.  The benchmarks seem to indicate that only  SELECT s  were done (or very few updates).  This could easily explain they good results for PostgreSQL in this test.  The bad results for MySQL will be obvious a  bit down in this document.     They did run the so-called benchmark from a Windows machine against a Linux machine over ODBC, a setup that no normal database user would ever do when running a heavy multi-user application.  This tested more the ODBC driver and the Windows protocol used between the clients than the database itself.     When running the database against Oracle and MS-SQL (Great Bridge has indirectly indicated that the databases they used in the test), they  didn't use the native protocol but instead ODBC.  Anyone that has ever  used Oracle knows that all real application uses the native interface  instead of ODBC.  Doing a test through ODBC and claiming that the results had anything to do with using the database in a real-world situation can't be regarded as fair.  They should have done two tests with and without ODBC to provide the right facts (after having got experts to tune all involved databases of course).     They refer to the TPC-C tests, but they don't mention anywhere that the test they did was not a true TPC-C test and they were not even allowed to call it a TPC-C test.  A TPC-C test can only be conducted by the rules approved by the TPC Council ( http://www.tpc.org ). Great Bridge  didn't do that.  By doing this they have both violated the TPC trademark and miscredited their own benchmarks.  The rules set by the TPC Council  are very strict to ensure that no one can produce false results or make unprovable statements.  Apparently Great Bridge wasn't interested in  doing this.     After the first test, we contacted Great Bridge and mentioned to them some of the obvious mistakes they had done with MySQL:         Running with a debug version of our ODBC driver     Running on a Linux system that wasn't optimized for threads     Using an old MySQL version when there was a recommended newer one available     Not starting MySQL with the right options for heavy multi-user use (the  default installation of MySQL is tuned for minimal resource use).     Great Bridge did run a new test, with our optimized ODBC driver and with  better startup options for MySQL, but refused to either use our updated  glibc library or our standard binary (used by 80% of our users), which was statically linked with a fixed glibc library.  According to what we know, Great Bridge did nothing to ensure that the other databases were set up correctly to run well in their test environment.  We are sure however that they didn't contact Oracle or Microsoft to ask for their advice in this matter ;)     The benchmark was paid for by Great Bridge, and they decided to publish only partial, chosen results (instead of publishing it all).      Tim Perdue, a long time PostgreSQL fan and a reluctant MySQL user published a comparison on  phpbuider .      When we became aware of the comparison, we phoned Tim Perdue about this because there were a lot of strange things in his results.  For example, he claimed that MySQL had a problem with five users in his tests, when we know that there are users with similar machines as his that are using MySQL with 2000 simultaneous connections doing 400 queries per second. (In this case the limit was the web bandwidth, not the database.)      It sounded like he was using a Linux kernel that either had some problems with many threads, such as kernels before 2.4, which had a problem  with many threads on multi-CPU machines. We have documented in this manual how to fix this and Tim should be aware of this problem.      The other possible problem could have been an old glibc library and that Tim didn't use a MySQL binary from our site, which is linked with a corrected glibc library, but had compiled a version of his own with. In any of the above cases, the symptom would have been exactly what Tim had measured.      We asked Tim if we could get access to his data so that we could repeat the benchmark and if he could check the MySQL version on the machine to find out what was wrong and he promised to come back to us about this. He has not done that yet.      Because of this we can't put any trust in this benchmark either :(      Over time things also changes and the above benchmarks are not that relevant anymore.  MySQL now have a couple of different table handlers with different speed/concurrency tradeoffs.  See section  7  MySQL Table Types . It would be interesting to see how the above tests would run with the different transactional table types in MySQL.  PostgreSQL has of course also got new features since the test was made.  As the above test are not publicly available there is no way for us to know how the database would preform in the same tests today.       Conclusion:      The only benchmarks that exist today that anyone can download and run against MySQL and PostgreSQL is the MySQL benchmarks.  We here at MySQL  believe that open source databases should be tested with open source tools! This is the only way to ensure that no one does tests that nobody can  reproduce and use this to claim that a database is better than another. Without knowing all the facts it's impossible to answer the claims of the tester.      The thing we find strange is that every test we have seen about PostgreSQL, that is impossible to reproduce, claims that PostgreSQL is better in most cases while our tests, which anyone can reproduce, clearly shows otherwise.  With this we don't want to say that PostgreSQL isn't good at many things (it is!) or that it isn't faster than MySQL under certain conditions.  We would just like to see a fair test where they are very good so that we could get some friendly competition going!      For more information about our benchmarks suite See section  5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite .       We are working on an even better benchmark suite, including multi user tests, and a better documentation of what the individual tests really do and how to add more tests to the suite.        1.6  MySQL and the future (The TODO)             This appendix lists the features that we plan to implement in MySQL.      Everything in this list is approximately in the order it will be done.  If you want to affect the priority order, please register a license or support us and tell us what you want to have done more quickly. See section  1.3  MySQL Licensing and Support .      The plan is that we in the future will support the full ANSI SQL99 standard, but with a lot of useful extensions. The challenge is to do this without sacrifying the speed or compromise the code.        1.6.1  Things that should be in 4.0     We plan to make MySQL Version 4.0 a ``quick'' release where we only add some new stuff to enable others to help us with developing new features into Version 4.1.  The MySQL 4.0 version should only take us about a month to make after which we want to stabilize it and start working on Version 4.1.  Version 4.0 should have the following new features:      The news section for 4.0 includes a list of the features we have already implemented in the 4.0 tree. See section  F.1  Changes in release 4.0.x (Development; Alpha) .          New table definition file format ( .frm  files) This will enable us to not run out of bits when adding more table options.  One will still be able to use the old  .frm  file format with 4.0.  All newly created tables will, however, use the new format.  The new file format will enable us to add new column types, more options for keys and  FOREIGN KEY  support.     mysqld  as a library.  This will have the same interface as the standard MySQL client (with an extra function to just set up startup parameters) but will be faster (no TCP/IP or socket overhead), smaller and much easier to use for embedded products.  One will be able to define at link time if one wants to use the client/server model or a stand-alone application just by defining which library to link with.  The  mysqld  will support all standard MySQL features and one can use it in a threaded client to run different queries in each thread.    Replication should work with  RAND()  and user variables  @var .    Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the master.     DELETE FROM table_name  will return the number of deleted rows. For fast execution one should use  TRUNCATE table_name .    Allow  DELETE  on  MyISAM  tables to use the record cache. To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update the  .MYD  file.    Better replication.    More functions for full-text search. See section  6.8.3  New Features of Full-text Search to Appear in MySQL 4.0 .    Character set casts and syntax for handling multiple character sets.    Allow users to change startup options without taking down the server.    Help for all commands from the client.    Secure connections (with SSL).    Extend the optimizer to be able to optimize some  ORDER BY key_name DESC  queries.     SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name  (used by  mysql  client to allow expansions of column names) should not open the table, but only the definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.    New key cache    When using  SET CHARACTER SET  we should translate the whole query at once and not only strings. This will enable users to use the translated characters in database, table and column names.    Add a portable interface over  gethostbyaddr_r()  so that we can change  ip_to_hostname()  to not block other threads while doing DNS lookups.    Add  record_in_range()  method to  MERGE  tables to be able to choose the right index when there is many to choose from. We should also extend the info interface to get the key distribution for each index, of  analyze  is run on all sub tables.     SET SQL_DEFAULT_TABLE_TYPE=[MyISAM | INNODB | BDB | HEAP] .       1.6.2  Things that must be done in the real near future         Fail safe replication.    Subqueries.  select id from t where grp in (select grp from g where u > 100)     Derived tables.   select a.col1, b.col2 from (select max(col1) as col1 from root_table ) a, other_table b where a.col1=b.col1    This could be done by automatically creating temporary tables for the derived tables for the duration of the query.    Add  PREPARE  of statements and sending of parameters to  mysqld .    Extend the server/client protocol to support warnings.    Add options to the server/protocol protocol to get progress notes for long running commands.    Add database and real table name (in case of alias) to the MYSQL_FIELD structure.    Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run MyISAM recover at the same time.    Change  INSERT ... SELECT  to optionally use concurrent inserts.    Implement  RENAME DATABASE . To make this safe for all table handlers, it should work as follows:       Create the new database.    For every table do a rename of the table to another database, as we do with the  RENAME  command.    Drop the old database.       Return the original field types() when doing  SELECT MIN(column) ... GROUP BY .    Multiple result sets.    Change the protocol to allow binary transfer of values. To do this efficiently, we need to add an API to allow binding of variables.    Make it possible to specify  long_query_time  with a granularity in microseconds.    Add a configurable prompt to the  mysql  command line client, with options like database in use, time and date...    Add range checking to  MERGE  tables.    Link the  myisampack  code into the server.    Port of MySQL to BeOS.    Port of the MySQL clients to LynxOS.    Add a temporary key buffer cache during  INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE  so that we can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.    If you perform an  ALTER TABLE  on a table that is symlinked to another disk, create temporary tables on this disk.    Implement a  DATE/DATETIME  type that handles time zone information properly, so that dealing with dates in different time zones is easier.    FreeBSD and MIT-pthreads;  Do sleeping threads take CPU?    Check if locked threads take any CPU.    Fix configure so that one can compile all libraries (like  MyISAM ) without threads.    Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed keys if they haven't been used in a while.    Allow join on key parts (optimization issue).     INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT  and  mysqld --concurrent-insert  to do a concurrent insert at the end of the file if the file is read-locked.    Remember  FOREIGN  key definitions in the  `.frm'  file.    Cascading  DELETE     Server side cursors.    Check if  lockd  works with modern Linux kernels; If not, we have to fix  lockd !  To test this, start  mysqld  with  --enable-locking  and run the different fork* test suits. They shouldn't give any errors if  lockd  works.    Allow SQL variables in  LIMIT , like in  LIMIT @a,@b .    Allow update of variables in  UPDATE  statements. For example:  UPDATE TABLE foo SET @a=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c     Change when user variables are updated so that one can use them with  GROUP BY , as in the following example:  SELECT id, @a:=count(*), sum(sum_col)/@a FROM table_name GROUP BY id .    Don't add automatic  DEFAULT  values to columns.  Give an error when using an  INSERT  that doesn't contain a column that doesn't have a  DEFAULT .    Caching of queries and results. This should be done as a separated module that examines each query and if this is query is in the cache the cached result should be returned.  When one updates a table one should remove as few queries as possible from the cache. This should give a big speed bost on machines with much RAM where queries are often repeated (like WWW applications). One idea would be to only cache queries of type:  SELECT CACHED ...     Fix  `libmysql.c'  to allow two  mysql_query()  commands in a row without reading results or give a nice error message when one does this.    Optimize  BIT  type to take 1 bit (now  BIT  takes 1 char).    Check why MIT-pthreads  ctime()  doesn't work on some FreeBSD systems.    Add an  IMAGE  option to  LOAD DATA INFILE  to not update  TIMESTAMP  and  AUTO_INCREMENT  fields.    Added  LOAD DATE INFILE.. UPDATE  syntax.       For tables with primary keys, if the data contains the primary key, entries matching that primary key are updated from the remainder of the columns. However, columns MISSING from the incoming data feed are not touched.    For tables tables with primary keys that are missing some part of the key in the incoming data stream, or that have no primary key, the feed is treated as a  LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO  is now.       Make  LOAD DATA INFILE  understand syntax like:   LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3) SET table_field1=concatenate(text_field1, text_field2), table_field3=23 IGNORE text_field3  This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file, or update columns based on expressions of the read data...        LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' INTO TABLE 'table_name' ERRORS TO err_table_name  This would cause any errors and warnings to be logged into the err_table_name table. That table would have a structure like:    line_number    - line number in data file error_message  - the error/warning message and maybe data_line      - the line from the data file       Add true  VARCHAR  support (There is already support for this in MyISAM).    Automatic output from  mysql  to netscape.     LOCK DATABASES . (with various options)    Change sort to allocate memory in ``hunks'' to get better memory utilization.     DECIMAL  and  NUMERIC  types can't read exponential numbers;  Field_decimal::store(const char *from,uint len)  must be recoded to fix this.    Functions: ADD_TO_SET(value,set) and REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set)    Add use of  t1 JOIN t2 ON ...  and  t1 JOIN t2 USING ...  Currently, you can only use this syntax with  LEFT JOIN .    Add full support for  unsigned long long  type.    Many more variables for  show status .  Counts for:  INSERT / DELETE / UPDATE  statements. Records reads and updated.  Selects on 1 table and selects with joins.  Mean number of tables in select. Number of  ORDER BY  and  GROUP BY  queries.    If you abort  mysql  in the middle of a query, you should open another connection and kill the old running query. Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.    Add a handler interface for table information so you can use it as a system table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables, but very flexible.   SHOW INFO FROM tbl_name  for basic table information should be implemented.    Add support for UNICODE.     NATURAL JOIN  and  UNION JOIN     Allow  select a from crash_me left join crash_me2 using (a) ; In this case a is assumed to come from the crash_me table.    Fix that  ON  and  USING  works with the  JOIN  join type.    Oracle like  CONNECT BY PRIOR ...  to search hierarchy structures.     mysqladmin copy database new-database . -- Requires COPY command to be added to  mysqld     Processlist should show number of queries/thread.     SHOW HOSTS  for printing information about the hostname cache.     DELETE  and  REPLACE  options to the  UPDATE  statement (this will delete rows when one gets a duplicate key error while updating).    Change the format of  DATETIME  to store fractions of seconds.    Add all missing ANSI92 and ODBC 3.0 types.    Change table names from empty strings to  NULL  for calculated columns.    Don't use 'Item_copy_string' on numerical values to avoid number->string->number conversion in case of:  SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM table_name GROUP BY id     Make it possible to use the new GNU regexp library instead of the current one (The GNU library should be much faster than the old one).    Change that  ALTER TABLE  doesn't abort clients that executes  INSERT DELAYED .    Fix that when columns referenced in an  UPDATE  clause contains the old values before the update started.     myisamchk ,  REPAIR  and  OPTIMIZE TABLE  should be able to handle cases where the data and/or index files are symbolic links.    Add simulation of  pread() / pwrite()  on Windows to enable concurrent inserts.    A logfile analyzer that could parsed out information about which tables are hit most often, how often multi-table joins are executed, etc.  It should help users identify areas or table design that could be optimized to execute much more efficient queries.    Add  SUM(DISTINCT)     Add  ANY() , EVERY()  and  SOME()  group functions. In ANSI SQL these only works on boolean columns, but we can extend these to work on any columns/expressions by applying: value == 0 -> FALSE and value <> 0 -> TRUE.    Fix that the type for  MAX(column)  is the same as the column type.   create table t1 (a DATE); insert into t1 values (now()); create table t2 select max(a) from t1; show columns from t2;       Come up with a nice syntax for a statement that will  UPDATE  the row if it exists and  INSERT  a new row if the row didn't exist. (Like  REPLACE  works with  INSERT  /  DELETE )       1.6.3  Things that have to be done sometime         Implement function:  get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)     Atomic multi-table updates, eg  update items,month set items.price=month.price where items.id=month.id; ;    Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only compressed tables use memmap.    Add a new privilege  'Show_priv'  for  SHOW  commands.    Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update log with  SET TIMESTAMP=#;     Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.    Full foreign key support. One probably wants to implement a procedural language first.    Simple views (first on one table, later on any expression).    Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table or temporary files gets error 23 (not enough open files).    When one finds a field=#, change all occurrences of field to #.  Now this is only done for some simple cases.    Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.    Optimize key = expression. At the moment only key = field or key = constant are optimized.    Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.    Change  `sql_yacc.yy'  to an inline parser to reduce its size and get better error messages (5 days).    Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments in function.    Use of full calculation names in the order part. (For ACCESS97)     UNION ,  MINUS ,  INTERSECT  and  FULL OUTER JOIN . (Currently only  LEFT OUTER JOIN  is supported)    Allow  UNIQUE  on fields that can be  NULL .     SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#  to put a time limit on a query.    Make the update log to a database.    Negative  LIMIT  to retrieve data from the end.    Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.    Please note the changes to  safe_mysqld : according to FSSTND (which Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into  `/var/run/<progname>.pid'  and log files into  `/var/log' . It would be nice if you could put the ""DATADIR"" in the first declaration of ""pidfile"" and ""log"", so the placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.    Allow a client to request logging.    Add use of  zlib()  for  gzip -ed files to  LOAD DATA INFILE .    Fix sorting and grouping of  BLOB  columns (partly solved now).    Stored procedures.  This is currently not regarded to be very important as stored procedures are not very standardized yet. Another problem is that true stored procedures make it much harder for the optimizer and in many cases the result is slower than before We will, on the other hand, add a simple (atomic) update language that can be used to write loops and such in the MySQL server.    Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement a semaphore library to MIT-pthreads.    Don't assign a new  AUTO_INCREMENT  value when one sets a column to 0. Use  NULL  instead.    Add full support for  JOIN  with parentheses.    As an alternative for one thread / connection manage a pool of threads to handle the queries.    Allow one to get more than one lock with  GET_LOCK .  When doing this, one must also handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.      Time is given according to amount of work, not real time.        1.6.4  Some things we don't have any plans to do         Nothing;  In the long run we plan to be fully ANSI 92 / ANSI 99 compliant.       2  MySQL Installation             This chapter describes how to obtain and install MySQL:          For a list of sites from which you can obtain MySQL, see section  2.2.1  How to Get MySQL .     To see which platforms are supported, see section  2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL . Please note that not all supported system are equally good for running MySQL on them. On some it is much more robust and efficient than others - see  section  2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL  for details.     Several versions of MySQL are available in both binary and source distributions.  We also provide public access to our current source tree for those who want to see our most recent developments and help us test new code.  To determine which version and type of distribution you should use, see section  2.2.3  Which MySQL Version to Use . When in doubt, use the binary distribution.     Installation instructions for binary and source distributions are described in section  M.1  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution  and section  2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution .  Each set of instructions includes a section on system-specific problems you may run into.     For post-installation procedures, see section  2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing .  These procedures apply whether you install MySQL using a binary or source distribution.       2.1  Quick Standard Installation of MySQL      2.1.1  Installing MySQL on Linux              The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using an RPM file. The MySQL RPMs are currently being built on a RedHat Version 6.2 system but should work on other versions of Linux that support  rpm  and use  glibc .      If you have problems with an RPM file, for example, if you receive the error `` Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up '', see section  2.6.1.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions .      The RPM files you may want to use are:        MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm   The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to connect to a MySQL server running on another machine.   MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm   The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to install this package.   MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm   Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and msql-mysql-modules RPMs.   MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm   Libraries and include files needed if you want to compile other MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.   MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm   This contains the source code for all of the above packages. It can also be used to try to build RPMs for other architectures (for example, Alpha or SPARC).      To see all files in an RPM package, run:   shell> rpm -qpl MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm      To perform a standard minimal installation, run:      shell> rpm -i MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm      To install just the client package, run:      shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm      The RPM places data in  `/var/lib/mysql' . The RPM also creates the appropriate entries in  `/etc/rc.d/'  to start the server automatically at boot time.  (This means that if you have performed a previous installation, you may want to make a copy of your previously installed MySQL startup file if you made any changes to it, so you don't lose your changes.)      After installing the RPM file(s), the  mysqld  daemon should be running and you should now be able to start using MySQL. See section  2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing .      If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary installation chapter. See section  M.1  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution .        2.1.2  Installing MySQL on Windows     The following instructions apply to precompiled binary distributions. If you download a source distribution, you will have to compile and install it yourself.      If you don't have a copy of the MySQL distribution, you should  first download one from  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html .      If you plan to connect to MySQL from some other program, you will probably also need the  MyODBC  driver. You can find this at the  MyODBC  download page ( http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html ).      To install either distribution, unzip it in some empty directory and run the  Setup.exe  program.      By default, MySQL-Windows is configured to be installed in  `C:\mysql' .  If you want to install MySQL elsewhere, install it in  `C:\mysql'  first, then move the installation to where you want it.  If you do move MySQL, you must indicate where everything is located by supplying a  --basedir  option when you start the server.  For example, if you have moved the MySQL distribution to  `D:\programs\mysql' , you must start  mysqld  like this:      C:\> D:\programs\mysql\bin\mysqld --basedir D:\programs\mysql      Use  mysqld --help  to display all the options that  mysqld  understands!      With all newer MySQL versions, you can also create a  `C:\my.cnf'  file that holds any default options for the MySQL server.  Copy the file  `\mysql\my-xxxxx.cnf'  to  `C:\my.cnf'  and edit it to suit your setup.  Note that you should specify all paths with  `/'  instead of  `\' . If you use  `\' , you need to specify it twice, because  `\'  is the escape character in MySQL.  See section  4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files .      Starting with MySQL 3.23.38, the Windows distribution includes both the normal and the  MySQL-Max  binaries.  The main benefit of using the normal  mysqld.exe  binary is that it's a little faster and uses less resources.      Here is a list of the different MySQL servers you can use:       mysqld    Compiled with full debugging and automatic memory allocation checking, symbolic links, BDB and InnoDB tables.    mysqld-opt    Optimized binary with no support for transactional tables.    mysqld-nt    Optimized binary for NT with support for named pipes. You can run this version on Win98, but in this case no named pipes are created and you must have TCP/IP installed.    mysqld-max    Optimized binary with support for symbolic links, BDB and InnoDB tables.    mysqld-max-nt    Like  mysqld-max , but compiled with support for named pipes.        Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is started with  --enable-named-pipe .      All of the above binaries are optimized for the Pentium Pro processor but should work on any Intel processor >= i386.      NOTE: If you want to use InnoDB tables, there are certain startup options that must be specified in your  `my.ini'  file! See section  7.6.2  InnoDB startup options .        2.2  General Installation Issues      2.2.1  How to Get MySQL                      Check the   MySQL home page  for information about the current version and for downloading instructions.

American     FactFinder (U.S. Census)                                                   Puerto Rico                                             Puerto Rico is a            commonwealth associated with the United States. Discovered by Columbus            in 1493, the island was ceded by Spain to the US in 1898 following the            Spanish-American War. A popularly elected governor has served since            1948. In plebiscites held in 1967 and 1993, voters chose to retain commonwealth            status. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is located in the Caribbean            Sea, about 1,000 miles east-southeast of Miami, Florida. A possession            of the United States, it consists of the island of Puerto Rico plus            the adjacent islets of Vieques, Culebra, and Mona.           Puerto Rico has            one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region. A diverse            industrial sector has surpassed agriculture as the primary locus of            economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free access to the            US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico            since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost            out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main source            of income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been            an important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals            of nearly 5 million tourists in 1999. Prospects for 2000 are good, assuming            continued strength in the tourism and construction sectors and continuation            of the US boom.            Under the Commonwealth            formula, residents of Puerto Rico lack voting representation in Congress            and the right to participate in presidential elections. Also, funding            caps limit their access to several key federal programs. As U.S. citizens,            Puerto Ricans are subject to military service and most federal laws.                       Puerto Rico ist            ein mit den USA verbundenes Commonwealth. Entdeckt wurde die Insel von            Columbus 1493. Im Jahr 1898, nach dem Ende des Spanisch-Amerikanischen            Krieges, wurde die Insel an die USA abgetreten. Ein von der Bevölkerung            gewählter Gouverneur dient seit 1948. Bei Volksabstimmungen in            den Jahren 1967 und 1993 beschlossen die Wähler, den Status als            Commonwealth beizubehalten. Das Commonwealth of Puerto Rico liegt in            der Karibik, rund 1.000 Meilen ost-südost von Miami, Florida. Der            Besitz der Vereinigten Staaten besteht aus der Insel Puerto Rico und            den benachbarten kleinen Inseln Vieques, Culebra und Mona.           Puerto Rico hat            eine der am schnellsten wachsenden Wirtschaften in der Karibik. Eine            vielfältige Industrie hat die Landwirtschaft als Hauptaspekt der            wirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten und des Einkommens überholt.            Amerikanische Firmen haben, angelockt durch zollfreien Zugang zu den            USA und Steuervorteilen, seit den 1950er Jahren kräftig in Puerto            Rico investiert. Die amerikanischen Mindestlohngesetze haben Gültigkeit.            Die Zuckerproduktion ist hinter die Herstellung von Milchprodukten und            anderen Tierprodukten als Haupteinnahmequelle im landwirtschaftlichen            Sektor zurückgefallen. Tourismus war schon immer eine wichtigte            Einkommensquelle auf der Insel. 1999 kamen etwa 5 Millionen Touristen.            Die Aussichten für 2000 sind gut, vorausgesetzt es gibt keine Einbrüche            beim Tourismus und in der Bauindustrie und eine Fortsetzung der guten            Entwicklung der Wirtschaft in den USA.           Im Rahmen der            Organisation des Commonwealth sind die Einwohner Puerto Ricos nicht            durch wahlberechtigte Repräsentanten im Kongress vertreten. Sie            dürfen auch nicht bei den Präsidentschaftwahlen wählen.            Ferner gibt es bei einigen zentralen Bundesprogrammen Ausgabenbeschränkungen.            Als amerikanische Bürger sind Puerto Ricaner militärpflichtig            und unterstehen den meisten Bundesgesetzen.
