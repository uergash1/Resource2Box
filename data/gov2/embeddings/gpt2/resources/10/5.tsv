Politics, naturally. It's a way to keep slicing off some of what has traditionally been a Republican vote.

He is the first  African American  to hold the office. Obama was the  junior   United States Senator  from  Illinois  from 2005 until he resigned following his  election  to the  presidency . He was  inaugurated  as President on January 20, 2009.   Obama is a graduate of  Columbia University  and  Harvard Law School , where he was the  first African American  president of the  Harvard Law Review . He worked as a  community organizer  in  Chicago  prior to earning his law degree, and practiced as a  civil rights  attorney in Chicago before serving three terms in the  Illinois Senate  from 1997 to 2004. He also taught  Constitutional Law  at the  University of Chicago Law School  from 1992 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the  U.S. House of Representatives  in 2000, Obama was elected to the Senate in November 2004. Obama delivered the  keynote address  at the  Democratic National Convention  in July 2004.

Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language  class at the  University of Hawaii at Mnoa , where his father was a foreign student on scholarship. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  The couple married on February 2, 1961 [ 14 ] , and Obama was born later that year. Obama's parents separated when Obama was two years old, and they divorced in 1964. [ 13 ]  Obama's father returned to Kenya and saw his son only once more before dying in an automobile accident in 1982. [ 15 ]   After her divorce, Dunham married  Indonesian  student  Lolo Soetoro , who was attending college in Hawaii. When  Soeharto , a military leader in Soetoro's home country,  came to power  in 1967, all students studying abroad were recalled and the family moved to  Indonesia . [ 16 ]  There Obama attended local schools in  Jakarta , such as Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, until he was ten years old.   He then returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn  and  Stanley Armour Dunham , while attending  Punahou School  from the  fifth grade  in 1971 until his graduation from high school in 1979. [ 17 ]  Obama's mother returned to Hawaii in 1972 for five years, and then in 1977 went back to Indonesia, where she worked as an  anthropological  field worker. She stayed there most of the rest of her life, returning to Hawaii in 1994. She died of  ovarian cancer  in 1995. [ 18 ]          Right-to-left: Barack Obama and half-sister  Maya Soetoro-Ng , with their mother  Ann Dunham  and grandfather  Stanley Dunham , in Hawaii (early 1970s).       Of his early childhood, Obama has recalled, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me  that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk  barely registered in my mind."" [ 19 ]  In his 1995 memoir, he described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his  multiracial  heritage. [ 20 ]  He wrote that he used  alcohol ,  marijuana  and  cocaine  during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind."" [ 21 ]  At the  2008 Civil Forum on the Presidency , Obama identified his high-school drug use as his ""greatest moral failure."" [ 22 ]   Some of his fellow students at Punahou School later told the  Honolulu Star-Bulletin  that Obama was mature for his age, and that he sometimes attended college parties and other events in order to associate with African American students and military service people. Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered  to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect  became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."" [ 23 ]   Following high school, Obama moved to  Los Angeles  in 1979 to attend  Occidental College . [ 24 ]  After two years he transferred in 1981 to  Columbia University  in New York City, where he majored in  political science  with a specialization in  international relations . [ 25 ]  Obama graduated with a  B.A.  from Columbia in 1983. He worked for a year at the  Business International Corporation [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  and then at the  New York Public Interest Research Group . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]   After four years in New York City, Obama moved to Chicago, where he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based  community organization  originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland ( Roseland ,  West Pullman  and  Riverdale ) on Chicago's far  South Side . He worked there for three years from June 1985 to May 1988. [ 28 ] [ 30 ]  During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from one to thirteen and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000. His achievements included helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens . [ 31 ]  Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation , a community organizing institute. [ 32 ]  In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time to Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives  for the first time. [ 33 ]   Obama entered  Harvard Law School  in late 1988. He was selected as an editor of the  Harvard Law Review  at the end of his first year, [ 34 ]  and president of the journal in his second year. [ 35 ]  During his summers, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley & Austin  in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter  in 1990. [ 36 ]  After graduating with a  Juris Doctor (J.D.)   magna cum laude [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. [ 34 ]   Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review  gained national media attention [ 35 ]  and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations. [ 39 ]  In an effort to recruit him to their faculty, the  University of Chicago Law School  provided Obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. [ 39 ]  He originally planned to finish the book in one year, but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir. In order to work without interruptions, Obama and his wife,  Michelle , traveled to  Bali  where he wrote for several months. The manuscript was finally published in mid-1995 as  Dreams from My Father . [ 39 ]   From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote , a voter registration drive with a staff of ten and 700 volunteers; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, and led to  Crain's Chicago Business  naming Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be. [ 40 ] [ 41 ]   For twelve years, Obama served as a professor at the  University of Chicago Law School  teaching  Constitutional Law . He was first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996 and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004. [ 42 ]  He also joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a twelve-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate  for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel  from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002. [ 28 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]   Obama was a founding member of the board of directors of  Public Allies  in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993. [ 28 ] [ 45 ]  He served from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago , which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and also from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Joyce Foundation . [ 28 ]  Obama served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge  from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. [ 28 ]  He also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, and the Lugenia Burns Hope Center. [ 28 ]     Political career: 19962008     State legislator: 19972004       Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate  in 1996, succeeding State Senator  Alice Palmer  as Senator from Illinois's 13th District, which then spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park - Kenwood  south to  South Shore  and west to  Chicago Lawn . [ 46 ]  Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation reforming ethics and health care laws. [ 47 ]  He sponsored a law increasing  tax credits  for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. [ 48 ]  In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures. [ 49 ]   Obama was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002. [ 50 ]  In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary run for  the U.S. House of Representatives  to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush  by a margin of two to one. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. [ 53 ]  He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling  by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. [ 48 ] [ 54 ]  During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty  reforms. [ 55 ]  Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. [ 56 ]     2004 U.S. Senate campaign     See also:  United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004     In mid-2002, Obama began considering a run for the U.S. Senate; he enlisted political strategist  David Axelrod  that fall and formally announced his candidacy in January 2003. [ 57 ]  Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald  and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun  not to contest the race launched wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. [ 58 ]  Obama's candidacy was boosted by Axelrod's advertising campaign featuring images of the late Chicago Mayor  Harold Washington  and an endorsement by the daughter of the late  Paul Simon , former U.S. Senator for Illinois. [ 59 ]  He received over 52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival. [ 60 ]   In July 2004, Obama wrote and delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention  in Boston, Massachusetts. [ 61 ]  After describing his maternal grandfather's experiences as a  World War II  veteran and a beneficiary of the  New Deal's   FHA  and  G.I. Bill  programs, Obama spoke about changing the U.S. government's economic and social priorities. He questioned the Bush administration's management of the Iraq War and highlighted America's obligations to its soldiers. Drawing examples from U.S. history, he criticized heavily partisan views of the electorate and asked Americans to find unity in diversity, saying, ""There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America."" [ 62 ]  Though it was not televised by the  three major broadcast news networks , a combined 9.1 million viewers watching on  PBS ,  CNN ,  MSNBC ,  Fox News  and  C-SPAN  saw Obama's speech, which was a highlight of the convention and confirmed his status as the Democratic Party's brightest new star. [ 63 ]   Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan , withdrew from the race in June 2004. [ 64 ]  Two months later and less than three months before Election Day,  Alan Keyes  accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. [ 65 ]  A long-time resident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois with the nomination. [ 66 ]  In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70% of the vote to Keyes' 27%, the largest victory margin for a statewide race in Illinois history. [ 67 ]     U.S. Senator: 20052008       Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 4, 2005. [ 68 ]  Obama was the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, and the third to have been  popularly elected . [ 69 ]  He was the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus . [ 70 ]   CQ Weekly ,  a nonpartisan publication, characterized him as a ""loyal Democrat"" based on analysis of all Senate votes in 20052007. The  National Journal  ranked him as the ""most liberal"" senator based on an assessment of selected votes during 2007; in 2005 he was ranked sixteenth most liberal, and in 2006 he was ranked tenth. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]  In 2008, Congress.org ranked him as the eleventh most powerful Senator. [ 73 ]  Obama announced on November 13, 2008 that he would resign his senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck  session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]  This enabled him to avoid the conflict of dual roles as President-elect and Senator in the lame duck session of Congress, which no sitting member of Congress had faced since  Warren Harding . [ 76 ]     Legislation     See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate            Senate bill sponsors Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Obama discussing the CoburnObama Transparency Act. [ 77 ]       Obama voted in favor of the  Energy Policy Act of 2005  and cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act . [ 78 ]  In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the  Secure Fence Act . [ 79 ]  Obama introduced two initiatives bearing his name: LugarObama, which expanded the  NunnLugar cooperative threat reduction  concept to conventional weapons, [ 80 ]  and the  CoburnObama Transparency Act , which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. [ 81 ]  On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama, along with Senators  Thomas R. Carper ,  Tom Coburn , and  John McCain , introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. [ 82 ]   Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. [ 83 ]  Obama is not hostile to  tort reform  and voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005  and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008  which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping  operations. [ 84 ]   In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. [ 85 ]  In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act , which was signed into law in September 2007. [ 86 ]  Obama also introduced  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act , a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections [ 87 ]  and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007 , [ 88 ]  neither of which have been signed into law.          Obama and U.S. Sen.  Richard Lugar  (R-IN) visit a Russian mobile launch missile dismantling facility in August 2005. [ 89 ]       Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges. [ 90 ]  This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. [ 91 ]  He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. [ 92 ] [ 93 ]  Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program  providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries. [ 94 ]     Committees   Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations ,  Environment and Public Works  and  Veterans' Affairs  through December 2006. [ 95 ]  In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions  and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs . [ 96 ]  He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs . [ 97 ]  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas  before he became  President  of the  Palestinian Authority , and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi  condemning corruption in the Kenyan government. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ]       2008 Presidential campaign       Main articles:  Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008  and  Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008             Wikinews  has related news:  Barack Obama elected 44th President of the United States       On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol  building in  Springfield, Illinois . [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The choice of the announcement site was symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln  delivered his historic  ""House Divided""  speech in 1858. [ 104 ]  Throughout the campaign, Obama emphasized the issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War , increasing  energy independence  and providing  universal health care . [ 105 ]          Obama stands on stage with his wife and two daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois , Feb. 10, 2007.       During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ]  On June 19, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing  in the general election since the system was created in 1976. [ 109 ]   A large number of candidates initially entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries . After a few initial contests, the field narrowed to a contest between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton , with each winning some states and the race remaining close throughout the primary process. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ]  On May 31, the  Democratic National Committee  agreed to seat all of the disputed  Michigan  and  Florida  delegates at the national convention, each with a half-vote, narrowing Obama's delegate lead. [ 114 ]  On June 3, with all states counted, Obama passed the threshold to become the  presumptive nominee . [ 115 ] [ 116 ]  On that day, he gave a victory speech in St. Paul, Minnesota. Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed him on June 7. [ 117 ]  From that point on, he campaigned for the general election race against Senator  John McCain , the  Republican  nominee.   On August 23, 2008, Obama announced that he had selected  Delaware  Senator  Joe Biden  as his vice presidential running mate. [ 118 ]          Obama delivers  his presidential election victory speech  in  Grant Park .       At the  Democratic National Convention  in  Denver ,  Colorado , Obama's former rival Hillary Clinton gave a speech in support of Obama's candidacy and later called for Obama to be nominated by  acclamation  as the Democratic presidential candidate. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  On August 28, Obama delivered a speech to 84,000 supporters in Denver. During the speech, which was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide, he accepted his party's nomination and presented his policy goals. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   After McCain was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, there were three  presidential debates  between Obama and McCain in September and October 2008. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  In November, Obama won the presidency with 53% of the  popular vote  and a wide  electoral vote  margin. His election sparked street celebrations in numerous cities in the United States [ 125 ]  and abroad.     Election victory       Main article:  Presidential transition of Barack Obama              Obama meets with then-President George W. Bush in the  Oval Office  on November 10, 2008.       On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the general election with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173 [ 126 ]  and became the first  African American  to be elected President of the United States. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In his  victory speech , delivered before a crowd of hundreds of thousands of his supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park , Obama proclaimed that ""change has come to America"". [ 131 ]  On January 8, 2009, a  joint session  of the  U.S. Congress  certified the  Electoral College  votes, officially declaring that Obama was elected President. [ 132 ]     Presidency       Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama       The  inauguration of Barack Obama  as the forty-fourth President, and Joe Biden as Vice President, took place on January 20, 2009. The theme of the inauguration was ""A New Birth of Freedom,"" commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of  Abraham Lincoln . [ 133 ]   In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda reversing President Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign establishments that allow abortions (known as the  Mexico City Policy  and referred by critics as the ""Global Gag Rule""), [ 134 ]  changed procedures to promote disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act [ 135 ] , directed the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from  Iraq [ 136 ] , and reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. [ 137 ]  He also issued orders closing  Guantanamo Bay detention camp  ""as soon as practicable and no later than"" January 2010. [ 138 ]     Political positions       Main article:  Political positions of Barack Obama       A method that some political scientists use for gauging  ideology  is to compare the annual ratings by the  Americans for Democratic Action  (ADA) with the ratings by the  American Conservative Union  (ACU). [ 139 ]  Based on his years in Congress, Obama has a lifetime average conservative rating of 7.67% from the ACU, [ 140 ]  and a lifetime average liberal rating of 90% from the ADA. [ 141 ]          Obama campaigning in  Abington, Pennsylvania , October 2008.       Obama was an early opponent of the Bush administration's  policies on Iraq . [ 142 ]  On October 2, 2002, the day President  George W. Bush  and  Congress  agreed on the  joint resolution  authorizing the Iraq War, [ 143 ]  Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally  in  Federal Plaza , [ 144 ]  speaking out against the war. [ 145 ] [ 146 ]  On March 16, 2003, the day Bush issued his 48-hour  ultimatum  to  Saddam Hussein  to leave Iraq before the U.S.  invasion of Iraq , [ 147 ]  Obama addressed the largest Chicago anti-Iraq War rally to date in  Daley Plaza  and told the crowd that ""it's not too late"" to stop the war. [ 148 ]  Although Obama had previously said he wanted all the U.S. troops out of Iraq within 16 months of becoming President, after he won the primary, he said he might refine plans as further developments unfold. [ 149 ]   Obama stated that if elected he would enact budget cuts in the range of tens of billions of dollars, stop investing in ""unproven""  missile defense systems , not weaponize space, ""slow development of  Future Combat Systems ,"" and work towards eliminating all  nuclear weapons . Obama favors ending development of new nuclear weapons, reducing the current U.S. nuclear stockpile, enacting a global ban on production of fissile material, and seeking negotiations with Russia in order to make it less necessary to have  ICBMs  on high-alert status. [ 150 ]   In November 2006, Obama called for a ""phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq"" and an opening of diplomatic dialogue with  Syria  and  Iran . [ 151 ]  In a March 2007 speech to  AIPAC , a  pro-Israel lobby , he said that the primary way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is through talks and diplomacy, although he did not rule out military action. [ 152 ]  Obama has indicated that he would engage in ""direct presidential diplomacy"" with Iran without preconditions. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ]  Detailing his strategy for fighting global terrorism in August 2007, Obama said ""it was a terrible mistake to fail to act"" against a 2005 meeting of al-Qaeda leaders that U.S. intelligence had confirmed to be taking place in Pakistan's  Federally Administered Tribal Areas . He said that as president he would not miss a similar opportunity, even without the support of the Pakistani government. [ 156 ]   In a December 2005,  Washington Post  opinion column, and at the  Save Darfur  rally in April 2006, Obama called for more assertive action to oppose  genocide  in the  Darfur region  of  Sudan . [ 157 ]  He has  divested  $180,000 in personal holdings of Sudan-related stock, and has urged divestment from companies doing business in Iran. [ 158 ]  In the JulyAugust 2007 issue of  Foreign Affairs , Obama called for an outward looking post-Iraq War  foreign policy  and the renewal of American military, diplomatic, and moral leadership in the world. Saying that ""we can neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission,"" he called on Americans to ""lead the world, by deed and by example."" [ 159 ]   In economic affairs, in April 2005, he defended the New Deal social welfare policies of  Franklin D. Roosevelt  and opposed Republican proposals to establish private accounts for  Social Security . [ 160 ]  In the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina , Obama spoke out against government indifference to growing economic class divisions, calling on both political parties to take action to restore the  social safety net  for the poor. [ 161 ]  Shortly before announcing his presidential campaign, Obama said he supports  universal health care  in the United States. [ 162 ]  Obama proposes to reward teachers for performance from traditional  merit pay  systems, assuring unions that changes would be pursued through the  collective bargaining  process. [ 163 ]   In September 2007, he blamed  special interests  for distorting the  U.S. tax code . [ 164 ]  His plan would eliminate taxes for  senior citizens  with incomes of less than $50,000 a year, repeal income tax cuts for those making over $250,000 as well as the capital gains and dividends tax cut, [ 165 ]  close corporate tax loopholes, lift the income cap on Social Security taxes, restrict offshore  tax havens , and simplify filing of income tax returns by pre-filling wage and bank information already collected by the  IRS . [ 166 ]  Announcing his presidential campaign's energy plan in October 2007, Obama proposed a  cap and trade  auction system to restrict carbon emissions and a ten year program of investments in new energy sources to reduce  U.S. dependence on imported oil . [ 167 ]  Obama proposed that all pollution credits must be auctioned, with no  grandfathering  of credits for oil and gas companies, and the spending of the revenue obtained on energy development and economic transition costs. [ 168 ]     Family and personal life       Main articles:  Early life and career of Barack Obama  and  Family of Barack Obama              Barack Obama and his wife  Michelle Obama .       In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family. ""It's like a little mini-United Nations."" he said. ""I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac , and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher ."" [ 169 ]  Obama has seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living, and a half-sister with whom he was raised,  Maya Soetoro-Ng , the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband. [ 170 ]  Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham [ 171 ]  until her death on November 2, 2008, just before the presidential election. [ 172 ]  In  Dreams from My Father , Obama ties his mother's family history to possible  Native American  ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis , president of the southern Confederacy during the  American Civil War . [ 173 ]  Obama's maternal and paternal grandfathers fought in  World War II . Obama's great-uncle served in the  89th Division  that overran  Ohrdruf , [ 174 ]  the first Nazi camp liberated by U.S. troops. [ 175 ]   Besides his native English, Obama speaks  Indonesian , at least on a colloquial level, which he learned during his four childhood years in Jakarta. [ 176 ]  After the  APEC summit  in November 2008, Indonesian president  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  related a telephone conversation with Obama in Indonesian to Indonesian media. [ 177 ]   Obama was known as ""Barry"" in his youth, but asked to be addressed with his given name during his college years. [ 178 ]          Obama playing basketball with U.S. military at  Camp Lemonier ,  Djibouti  in 2006. [ 179 ]       He plays  basketball , a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team. [ 180 ]   In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson , whom he later married, when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin . [ 181 ]  Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. [ 182 ]  They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. [ 183 ]  The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, [ 184 ]  followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001. [ 185 ]  Because of Michelle Obama's employment with the  University of Chicago , the Obama daughters attended the private  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools . When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private  Sidwell Friends School . [ 186 ]   Applying the proceeds of a book deal, in 2005 the family moved from a  Hyde Park , Chicago condominium to their current $1.6 million house in neighboring  Kenwood . [ 187 ]  The purchase of the property was coordinated with  Tony Rezko , a major political contributor to Obama, who later sold part of the adjacent lot to the Obamas. The transaction attracted media attention because of Rezko's later indictment and subsequent conviction on political corruption charges for unrelated activities. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]   In December 2007,  Money  magazine estimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3 million. [ 190 ]  Their 2007 tax return showed a household income of $4.2 millionup from about $1 million in 2006 and $1.6 million in 2005mostly from sales of his books. [ 191 ]   Obama is a  Christian  whose religious views have evolved in his adult life. In  The Audacity of Hope , Obama writes that he ""was not raised in a religious household."" He describes his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as ""non-practicing Methodists and Baptists"") to be detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known."" He describes his father as ""raised a  Muslim ,"" but a ""confirmed  atheist "" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" In the book, Obama explains how, through working with  black churches  as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."" [ 192 ] [ 193 ]  He was baptized at the  Trinity United Church of Christ  in 1988 and was an active member there for two decades. [ 194 ] [ 195 ]   While he has never been a heavy smoker, Obama has tried to  quit smoking  several times, including a well-publicized and ongoing effort which he began before launching his presidential campaign. [ 196 ]  Obama has said he will not smoke in the White House. [ 197 ]     Cultural and political image       Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama       With his black Kenyan father and white American mother, his upbringing in Honolulu and Jakarta, and his  Ivy League  education, Obama's early life experiences differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement . [ 198 ]  Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists  that the debate is not about his physical appearance or his record on issues of concern to black voters. Obama said that ""we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."" [ 199 ]   Echoing the  inaugural address of John F. Kennedy , Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."" [ 200 ]  A popular  catch phrase  distilled the concept: "" Rosa   sat  so  Martin  could  walk ; Martin walked so Obama could run; Obama is running so our children can fly."" [ 201 ]          From left: Presidents  George H. W. Bush , Barack Obama,  George W. Bush ,  Bill Clinton  and  Jimmy Carter  meet in the  Oval Office  on January 7, 2009.       Obama has been praised as a master of  oratory  on par with other renowned speakers in the past such as  Martin Luther King, Jr. [ 202 ] [ 203 ]  His "" Yes We Can "" speech, which artists independently set to music in a video produced by  will.i.am , was viewed by 10 million people on  YouTube  in the first month, [ 204 ]  and received an  Emmy Award . [ 205 ]   University of Virginia  professor  Jonathan Haidt  researched the effectiveness of Obama's public speaking and concluded that part of his excellence is because the politician is adept at inspiring the emotion of  elevation , the desire to act morally and do good for others. [ 206 ]  Obama used these communication skills in a series of weekly internet video addresses during his pre-inauguration transition period; [ 207 ]  he has suggested he will make a series of broadcast and internet addresses similar to  Franklin D. Roosevelt 's famous  fireside chats  throughout his term as president to explain his policies and actions. [ 208 ]   Many commentators mentioned Obama's international appeal as a defining factor for his public image. [ 209 ]  Not only did several polls show strong support for him in other countries, [ 210 ]  but Obama also established close relationships with prominent foreign politicians and elected officials even before his presidential candidacy, notably with then incumbent  British Prime Minister   Tony Blair , whom he met in  London  in 2005, [ 211 ]  with  Italy 's  Democratic Party  leader and then  Mayor  of  Rome   Walter Veltroni , who visited Obama's Senate office in 2005, [ 212 ]  and with  French President   Nicolas Sarkozy , who also visited him in  Washington  in 2006. [ 213 ]   Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album   Grammy Awards  for  abridged   audiobook  versions of both of his books; for  Dreams from My Father  in February 2006 and for  The Audacity of Hope  in February 2008. [ 214 ]   In December 2008,  Time  magazine named Barack Obama as its  Person of the Year  for his historic candidacy and election, which it described as ""the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.""

""I think that from my understanding, President-elect Obama is trying to reach out to people that don't agree and do agree with him, to unite the country. I certainly don't agree with Reverend Rick Warren. I'm sure Reverend Warren doesn't agree with me on certain things. But I think there's room for everyone and I think that is what President Obama is trying do. I thought it was a very gracious thing. I think Warren said it was courageous. I think it was both,"" said Sharpton. ""I think that President-elect Obama showed a lot of graciousness extending this to him, showing that he's trying to pull the country together even with those he disagrees with and [those that are] frankly... less than gracious to him.""    The remarks come on the third day of sustained and loud protest over the invocation choice, which both Warren and Obama have labored to defend. Warren's views on gay rights, stem cell research and torture are seen not just as in complete contrast to Obama's agenda, but antithetical to the very inclusiveness that the president-elect is hoping to promote.     Four years ago, the shoe was on the other foot. For his reelection inauguration, George W. Bush asked Rev. Dr. Louis Leon of Washington's St. John's Church Lafayette Square to deliver the invocation. Leon and Bush had a personal relationship developed over the years that the president attended his church. The two also shared policy commitments towards fighting AIDS and, to a lesser extent, pushing immigration reform ( in one sermon  that Bush attended, Leon blasted Congress for its failure to pass legislation on the topic). The president, in fact,  sat in the pew  at Leon's church right after the attacks of September 11th.     But the two, as Leon acknowledges, had their share of political differences. And it was of some interest that Bush had tasked him for the inauguration spotlight.       Reached by phone and asked to compare his situation with the current one, Leon demurred. Pressed if he had any tips for Warren, he said: ""I wouldn't dare offer Reverend Warren a piece of advice.""     That said, the Warren and Leon comparisons go only so far. And progressives are right to note that Leon was never a symbol of exclusion the way that Warren, through his public support of Proposition 8 in California, has become.

Politics, naturally. It's a way to keep slicing off some of what has traditionally been a Republican vote.

He had most of my albums from the very first one. What? This didn't sound like a gay hater.

The best way to understand Warren's remark about supposedly loving ""gays"" is to look at his own church's policy statement about lesbian and gay people.

If there is a rational argument against gay marriage, I have yet to see it. And this is why Obama's invitation to Warren might just work. A major limitation to progressive thinking is our over-reliance on rational debate.
