Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC)   The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium, a group of federal land management agencies, is purchasing nation-wide coverage of Landsat 7 data for three dates in order to produce a comprehensive land cover database for the United States.  The goal of the consortium is to meet the needs of Federal agencies for nationally consistent satellite remote sensing and land cover data.  The consortium also provides the imagery and land cover data as public domain information which can be accessed through this  web site .                                 USGS LDCM website released   Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based land remote sensing data. For over 30 years, the Landsat satellite series has collected and produced low-cost, moderate-resolution multispectral data for researchers and decision-makers worldwide. The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) is intended to ensure the continued acquisition and availability of Landsat-quality data into the future. The Department of Interior (DOI)/USGS and NASA are currently engaged in a partnership to support this activity. The new USGS  LDCM website  will provide information and updates as the mission develops over time.                               LP DAAC Crosses Petabyte Threshold  On November 20, 2003, the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) data holdings at the USGS EROS Data Center  crossed the one petabyte threshold in volume .  One petabyte represents 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes, or equivalent to 500 billion standard-size document pages. This data volume is 100 times the volume content of the U.S. Library of Congress. Additional information concerning the LP DAAC and available products may be found at  http://LPDAAC.usgs.gov                                                                                 EO-1 Mission Extended and Prices Reduced!        Based on current funding projections, and in support of Landsat data users, NASA and the USGS plan to extend the  EO-1 mission  at least through fiscal year 2004 (through September).   This assurance enables current and prospective users to plan now for EO-1 data to be captured this summer.   Additional good news for customers comes in the form of a USGS price decrease. The price decrease is the result of recently upgraded data processing equipment and will take effect on January 15, 2004.  Customers now have access to over 20,000 EO-1 archive scenes - either  Hyperion  or  Advanced Land Imager  (ALI) - at $250.00 each,  half the previous price .  While the data acquisition fee remains at $1500 to acquire a new customer-specified scene from anywhere around the globe (poles excepted), the charge for processing the scene data is now $250.00, for a total of $1750.00 vs. the previous total of $2000.00.   Technical note:  As an experimental satellite, EO-1 does not have the capacity to fill in for all data missing from a Landsat 7 scene affected by that satellite's failed scan-line corrector.  The  EO-1 ALI sensor  can image smaller study sites, however, given its 37 km swath width.  ALI scenes typically are acquired in strips 60 km along-track, of which 42 km are usable and are provided in a Level-1 product format.  However, longer scenes (up to 185 km along-track) can be acquired on request at an additional charge.                               Landsat Orthorectified Imagery  Through cooperative efforts between NASA and the commercial remote sensing community, the USGS EROS Data Center released two new Landsat-7 products on December 23, 2003.  The Landsat orthorectified ETM+ imagery and Landsat orthorectified Pan sharpened ETM+ Imagery data sets joined the Landsat orthorectified TM imagery data set, which was used as to establish the baseline for these two new products. Together, these products form a suite of quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over the Earth's landmasses, which provide users with remote sensing data for tracking change over much of the Earth.

GX003-40-13168989	"---------------- LANDSAT 7 ----------------          Supplying data users worldwide with low cost, multi-purpose, land remote sensing data into the next century   Artist's rendering of Landsat 7  (51 kb)     In 1992, the US Congress authorized the procurement, launch and operation  of a new Landsat satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, is now under  construction and is scheduled for launch in April, 1999. It will be the  latest in a series of earth observation satellites dating back to 1972. The  twenty-two year record of data acquired by the Landsat satellites constitutes  the longest continuous record of the earth's continental surfaces. Preservation  of the existing record and continuation of the Landsat capability were  identified in the law as critical to land surface monitoring and global change  research.    Landsat 7 will have a unique and essential role in the realm of earth  observing satellites in orbit by the end of this decade. No other system will  match Landsat's combination of synoptic coverage, high spatial resolution,  spectral range and radiometric calibration. In addition, the Landsat Program  is committed to provide Landsat digital data to the user community in  greater quantities, more quickly and at lower cost than at any previous time  in the history of the program.   The earth observing instrument on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic  Mapper Plus (ETM+), replicates the capabilities of the highly successful  Thematic Mapper instruments on Landsats 4 and 5*. The ETM+ also  includes new features that make it a more versatile and efficient instrument  for global change studies, land cover monitoring and assessment, and large  area mapping than its design forebears. The primary new features on  Landsat 7 are:      a panchromatic band with 15m spatial resolution    on board, full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration    a thermal IR channel with 60m spatial resolution      Landsat 7 and ETM+ Characteristics:       Band Number   Spectral Range (microns)   Ground Resolution (m)       1   .45 to .515   30       2   .525 to .605   30       3   .63 to .690   30       4   .75 to .90   30       5   1.55 to 1.75   30       6   10.40 to 12.5   60       7   2.09 to 2.35   30       Pan   .52 to .90   15               Swath width:   185 kilometers       Repeat coverage interval:   16 days (233 orbits)       Altitude:   705 kilometers       Quantization:   Best 8 of 9 bits       On-board data storage:   ~375 Gb (solid state)       Inclination:   Sun-synchronous, 98.2 degrees       Equatorial crossing:   Descending node; 10:00am +/- 15 min.       Launch vehicle:   Delta II       Launch date:   April 1999            The instrument will be supported by a ground network that will receive  ETM+ data via X-band direct downlink only at a data rate of 150 Mbps. The  primary receiving station will be at the US Geological Survey's (USGS)    EROS Data Center (EDC)  in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Substantially cloud- free, land and coastal scenes will be acquired by  EDC through real-time  downlink, and by playback from an on-board, solid state, recording device. The capacities of the satellite, instrument and ground system will be sufficient to allow for continuous acquisition of all substantially cloud free scenes at the primary receiving station.  In addition, a world-wide network of receiving stations will be able to receive real-time, direct downlink of image data via X-band. Each station will be able to receive data only for that part of the ETM+ ground track where the satellite is in sight of the receiving station.   The Landsat 7 system will insure continuity of Thematic Mapper type data  into the next century. These data will be made available to all users through  EDC at the cost of fulfilling user requests. Browse data (a lower resolution  image for determining image location, quality and information content) and  metadata (descriptive information on the image) will be available, on-line, to  users within 24 hours of acquisition of the image by the primary ground  station. EDC will process all Landsat 7 data received to  ""Level 0R""  ( i.e. corrected for scan direction and band alignment but without radiometric or geometric correction) and archive the data in that format.  A systematically corrected product  (Level 1G)  will be generated and distributed to users on request. The user will have the option of performing further processing on the data on user-operated digital processing equipment or by a commercial, value added firm.   The Landsat 7 spacecraft is being built by Lockheed Martin,  Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes  Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. Construction of both is managed through  contracts between the manufacturers and the NASA Goddard Space Flight  Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.   The Landsat Program, as defined by Congress in 1992 and amended by   Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3 in May, 1994, is managed  cooperatively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the  USGS. Responsibility for construction of the spacecraft and instrument lies  with NASA. The Landsat Program is part of the NASA's global change  initiative - the Earth Observing System, administered by the NASA Office of  Mission to Planet Earth. Landsat 7 will be operated by NOAA. Data  processing, archiving and distribution will be performed by USGS with  direction from NOAA. These functions will be executed in coordination with  the EDC Distributed Active Archive Center    (EDC DAAC)  of NASA's  Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.     *The ETM+ is similar to the ETM instrument on Landsat 6. Landsat 6 was launched in October, 1993, but failed to obtain orbit.

The TM sensors have provided nearly continuous coverage from July 1982 to present, with a 16-day repeat cycle.   TM image data consists of seven spectral bands ( band designations ) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for most bands (1-5 and 7). Resolution for the thermal infrared (band 6) is 120 meters.  The approximate scene size will be 170 x 183 kilometers (106 x 115 miles).     The following level of correction is available to the general public:    Systematic Correction  includes both radiometric and geometric correction. The scene will be rotated, aligned, and georeferenced to a user-defined map projection. Absolute geometric accuracy of the systematically corrected TM product can vary, depending upon the accuracy of the predicted ephemeris that is used for processing.  Users should be aware that subsequent image geocorrection and/or coregistration to known ground control points (GCPs) may be necessary with a TM product.     The following levels of correction are available to  Approved U.S. Government and its Affiliated Users (USGAU)  only:   Precision Correction   includes radiometric and geometric correction, as well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve accuracy. For locations outside the U.S., accuracy of the precision-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local GCPs.     Terrain Correction   includes radiometric, geometric, and precision correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to correct parallax error due to local topographic relief. For locations outside the U.S., accuracy of the terrain-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the resolution of the best available DEM.     For all levels of correction, the following processing parameters are user-defined:               Processing Parameters       Available options             Map projection       UTM  Space Oblique Mercator Albers Equal-Area  other*            Horizontal datum       WGS84 NAD83 NAD27 other*        Resampling method       cubic convolution (CC) nearest neighbor (NN) other*                 Image orientation       Map (north up) Path (satellite; not recommended for UTM projection)               Pixel size       30 meter (30m/120m)  28.5 meter (28.5m/114m)  other*                  Multi-scene**       available for up to 3 scenes                Scene shift       available in 10% increments (north-to-south only)              *Other options may be available upon request.     **Multi-scenes are only available for scenes (rows) that were acquired and archived  consecutively along the same path for the same date.

This bulk pricing does not apply to multi-scene Landsat TM products.     Back to Top        Landsat 5 Radiometry -  update    As of May 5, 2003, the USGS EDC has implemented an enhancement to our method of radiometric processing for Landsat 5 TM data. For further information on the background and nature of the changes, please refer to the  Landsat 5 Calibration Notices .   As a result of the improvements in Landsat 5 radiometric processing, users should be aware that the  values for LMAX (and rescaled gains) have changed from previously published values.  For details, see  Revised Landsat 5 TM Radiometric Calibration Procedures (PDF) .   We are working to provide a correction table and algorithm(s) for past customers who have existing Landsat 5 TM data that was generated by NLAPS prior to the radiometric processing enhancement.  As soon as the correction becomes available, details will be posted at:  Landsat 5 Calibration Notices .           Back to Top       Search & Order    All TM scenes in the USGS archive can be searched by geographic location on  Earth Explorer . For scenes that are orderable online and have a browse image available,   GloVis  also provides an alternative ""quick and easy"" image-based search and order tool. If searching by the WRS (Worldwide Reference System) of paths and rows, all Landsat 4/5 TM data is referenced to the  WRS-2  scheme.   The method for placing an order will depend upon the level of correction desired:                   Systematic Correction       Earth Explorer           GloVis             Precision Correction        contact us  (USGAU researchers  only)               Terrain Correction        contact us  (USGAU researchers only)               Recently acquired scenes with direct downlink to USGS EDC should generally become available for search and order within 24 hours of scene acquisition on weekdays (Monday through Friday). Scene acquisitions that occur on Saturdays and/or Sundays will be available for search and order by  the following Monday afternoon.    Locations outside the U.S.:  For international locations, there may be Landsat TM scenes that were collected by the instrument but the scenes are not archived or distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC).  These scenes may be available from other  International Ground Stations . Note that these data would not be a product of the USGS EDC and therefore the prices, available formats, and/or processing options may vary according to the data provider.    Back to Top       Preview Images   Landsat TM images should always be previewed prior to purchase.  The availability of a browse image for TM will depend on the date and location, but many scenes can be previewed by searching on  Earth Explorer  or  GloVis .   Each TM browse image is a subsampled JPEG of the actual scene data. The browse image is displayed as a 5,4,3 (RGB) composite with a standardized 2% linear stretch applied.
