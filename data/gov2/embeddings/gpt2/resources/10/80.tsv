Bush      Federal funding of research using existing embryonic stem cell lines is consistent with the President's belief in the fundamental value and sanctity of human life.   The President's decision reflects his fundamental commitment to preserving the value and sanctity of human life and his desire to promote vital medical research. The President's decision will permit federal funding of research using the more than 60 existing stem cell lines that have already been derived, but will not sanction or encourage the destruction of additional human embryos. The embryos from which the existing stem cell lines were created have already been destroyed and no longer have the possibility of further development as human beings.  Federal funding of medical research on these existing stem cell lines will promote the sanctity of life "" without undermining it "" and will allow scientists to explore the potential of this research to benefit the lives of millions of people who suffer from life destroying diseases.     Federal funds will only be used for research on existing stem cell lines that were derived: (1) with the informed consent of the donors; (2) from excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes; and (3) without any financial inducements to the donors.  In order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical, the NIH will examine the derivation of all existing stem cell lines and create a registry of those lines that satisfy this criteria.  More than 60 existing stem cell lines from genetically diverse populations around the world are expected to be available for federally-funded research.     No federal funds will be used for: (1) the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed embryos; (2) the creation of any human embryos for research purposes; or (3) the cloning of human embryos for any purpose.  Today's decision relates only to the use of federal funds for research on existing stem cell lines derived in accordance with the criteria set forth above.     The President will create a new President's Council on Bioethics, chaired by Dr. Leon Kass, an expert in biomedical ethics and a professor at the University of Chicago, to study the human and moral ramifications of developments in biomedical and behaviorial science and technology.  The Council will study such issues as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, genetic screening, gene therapy, euthanasia, psychoactive drugs, and brain implants.     BACKGROUND    Embryonic stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells, which come from the inner cell mass of a human embryo, have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body.  The scientific term for this characteristic is ""pluripotentiality.""    Adult stem cells.  Adult stem cells are unspecialized, can renew themselves, and can become specialized to yield all of the cell types of the tissue from which they originate.  Although scientists believe that some adult stem cells from one tissue can develop into cells of another tissue, no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent.    The potential of embryonic stem cell research.  Many scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research may eventually lead to therapies that could be used to treat diseases that afflict approximately 128 million Americans.  Treatments may include replacing destroyed dopamine-secreting neurons in a Parkinson's patient's brain; transplanting insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic patients; and infusing cardiac muscle cells in a heart damaged by myocardial infarction.  Embryonic stem cells may also be used to understand basic biology and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new medicines.    The creation of embryonic stem cells.  To create embryonic stem cells for research, a ""stem cell line"" must be created from the inner cell mass of a week-old embryo.  If they are cultured properly, embryonic stem cells can grow and divide indefinitely.  A stem cell line is a mass of cells descended from the original, sharing its genetic characteristics.  Batches of cells can then be separated from the cell line and distributed to researchers.    The origin of embryonic stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells are derived from excess embryos created in the course of infertility treatment.  As a result of standard in vitro fertilization practices, many excess human embryos are created.  Participants in IVF treatment must ultimately decide the disposition of these excess embryos, and many individuals have donated their excess embryos for research purposes.    Existing stem cell lines. There are currently more than 60 existing different human embryonic stem cell lines that have been developed from excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization with the consent of the donors and without financial inducement.  These existing lines are used in approximately one dozen laboratories around the world (in the United States, Australia, India, Israel, and Sweden).      Therapies from adult and embryonic stem cell research.  To date, adult stem cell research, which is federally-funded, has resulted in the development of a variety of therapeutic treatments for diseases.  Although embryonic stem cell research has not yet produced similar results, many scientists believe embryonic stem cell research holds  promise over time because of the capacity of embryonic stem cells to develop into any tissue in the human body.

GX269-97-3870459	"Vol. 56, No. 16  August 5, 1996  Dengue Fever Dengue was endemic in parts of the United States, including Texas, until 1945, when improved sanitation and the use of pesticides dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease. Only sporadic, travel-related dengue cases were reported through 1979, but outbreaks with some indigenous transmission occurred in 1980 and 1986.1,2 Indigenous cases were again reported, from Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, in 1995. Understandably, interest in dengue is once again high. The first section of this report is a brief retrospective of dengue's history, characteristics, and current status in this hemisphere. The following section contains Texas morbidity and mortality data for 1995.  Dengue Retrospective Among the newly emergent and re-emergent diseases in the Western Hemisphere is dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease characterized by high fever, headache, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash. There are four virus serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN4, all of which are transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and possibly by Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Both species lay their eggs in open containers of water. Due in part to the disappearance of mosquito eradication programs, dengue has once again swept Latin America and now threatens the US. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 274,922 cases of dengue and 7,715 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with 104 deaths, occurred in the Americas in 1995.3 In response to the current situation, PAHO has drafted an emergency action plan, focusing on education of at-risk populations, international cooperation in surveillance, and reactivation of vector control programs.  word derives from the Swahili description of the disease: ki denga pepo, meaning ""cramplike seizure caused by an evil spirit.""5 Outbreaks widely affected Texas residents during every decade from 1885 to 1941, primarily due to the rapid expansion of the shipping industry.6 Ships transported infected mosquitoes and people to unaffected areas, leading to pandemics of dengue in the western hemisphere as early as 1827 and every 20 or 30 years for the rest of the century. As commercial ports in Texas flourished, the disease was imported along with more desirable cargo into Galveston, Brownsville, and Houston, often reaching as far inland as Austin. In the late 1800s, the diagnosis of dengue was still confusing; some practitioners considered it to be a form of yellow fever. Doctors earned their patients' ire by, ""charging them two yellow fever bills, whilst contending that the disease attacks but once.""7 Yellow fever was not the only source of confusion in diagnosis. Throughout the 19th century arthritic symptoms were associated with what was then called dengue. In hindsight, this situation Continued F  A Brief Stateside History of Dengue Nearly two centuries ago Benjamin Rush, a doctor in Philadelphia, wrote what may have been the first clinical report of dengue. Describing an epidemic that occurred in Philadelphia in 1789, he called the illness ""breakbone fever.""4 During a West Indies epidemic 30 years later, the word dengue was coined to describe the symptoms outlined by Rush. This  Also in this issue: A Pot of Shigella at Rainbow's End Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area Perspectives in Public Health Conference Conference Registration Form   Page 2  August 5, 1996  DPN  suggests that an agent other than dengue was at work. Until the laboratory isolation of the etiologic agent itself, practitioners had to rely on clinical findings to define these and other illnesses easily mistaken for dengue (eg, typhus, rubella, and measles). By the close of the century, healthcare providers in Texas began to realize that textbook descriptions of dengue did not correspond to the disease as it appeared in this state.6 By 1906 dengue had been well defined clinically, and T. L. Bancroft had shown the etiologic agent to be an ultramicroscopic organism transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.5 He conducted his experiments using human subjects. Bancroft's discovery is particularly interesting in light of the fact that the dengue virus was not isolated in the laboratory for another 40 years. In 1922 an epidemic of enormous proportions--one million people are estimated to have been affected--began in Galveston and spread as far as Georgia.8 Although the initial cases were most likely imported, the majority of subsequent cases were locally acquired. The mosquitoes that year had bred in unprecedented proportions, and no eradication efforts had been made. According to a clinical report of the Galveston outbreak, Unscreened houses of the poorer classes, situated near or around the dumping grounds, swarmed with these mosquitoes. They gained entrance to practically all screened houses, invaded automobiles, and countless numbers were present in the grass of overgrown gutters and lawns. The dumping grounds mentioned were swamps used as a garbage dump by the citizens. Many observations of the incubation period were made during this time, increasing knowledge of the disease. Diagnosis in 1922 was based on signs still used today: sudden onset, fever, headache, body aches, and rash.  Outbreaks also occurred in Texas in 1934 and 1941. As was likely during antecedent outbreaks, the virus was probably imported from the Caribbean. The subsequent decline in endemic cases resulted from improved sanitation in the US and from Ae. aegypti eradication programs initiated by PAHO in 1947.9 By 1962 the mosquito was believed to be confined to a few relatively small areas, which included parts of the US, the coasts of Mexico, all of Colombia, and northern Argentina. Ten years later, due to waning interest and political unrest, almost all programs had been discontinued. Today the range of Ae. aegypti includes most of Central and South America, Mexico, and the Southeastern United States (including Texas). (See Figure 1.) Ae. albopictus is another mosquito considered to be a dengue vector. Introduced into the Americas by 1985, probably in tires shipped from Asia, this vector has since spread. It can be found throughout the eastern two-thirds of Texas.10  Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever In 1954 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which had been frequently described but was still unnamed, appeared in the Philippines. Since then, DHF has emerged as a deadly and epidemic problem in the Americas and Asia.11 DHF is characterized by high fever, like classic dengue, but has more serious complications: hemorrhagic phenomena, pain, and circulatory failure. Easy bruising, fine petechiae, epistaxis, and mild gastrointestinal bleeding are, in decreasing order of frequency, DHF symptoms caused by increased capillary permeability. The fatality rate for DHF is about 5% in most countries. One third of DHF cases progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a short (12 to 24 hour) stage of illness that may lead to widely disseminated hemorrhage and coma. The case-fatality rate for untreated DSS is 20%. Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 3  Figure 1. Distribution of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes: North and South America, 1970 and 1995 1970 1990  Shaded areas show large mosquito populations.  The risk of developing DHF is 100 times greater with a second heterotypical infection.9 Although the precise mechanisms affecting the development of DHF are not fully understood, the second infection is thought to trigger an immunopathologic process involving non-neutralizing antibodies from the previous infection.  spread of dengue, also imply that greater efforts should be made to educate practitioners in the diagnosis and control of dengue, especially in high risk areas. In addition, PAHO recommends mosquito surveillance, evaluation of vector control programs, and development of public education programs.9 Education programs must include basic information about the breeding habits of mosquitoes and the necessity for community efforts in removing breeding containers such as aluminum cans, buckets, and used tires from areas of human habitation. According to PAHO, dengue is ""basically a problem of domestic sanitation.""9 The community, therefore, holds the key to the control of mosquitoes, and community efforts determine whether control programs succeed or fail. Prepared by Greg Brown, Student Intern, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Surveillance Division  The Current Situation DEN -2, -1, and -4 have spread, in that order, throughout Latin America after having vanished almost completely during the mosquito eradication programs of the 1950s and 1960s. DEN-3 was introduced to the Americas recently and is spreading,12 bringing with it an increased incidence of both DHF and DSS. A 1980 study found that there was a median of 40 days between the onset of dengue and the diagnosis of disease, suggesting the need for earlier diagnosis of dengue infection and implementation of active surveillance systems.1 These findings, combined with the rapid  Continued F   Page 4 References  August 5, 1996  DPN  TDH was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa....

The proximity of these outbreaks and the fact that the mosquito species that transmit dengue are commonly found in the eastern two-thirds of the state, increased the likelihood of both imported and autochthonous cases occurring in Texas. Therefore, TDH immediately implemented an educational campaign that stressed prevention and an active surveillance system to monitor the situation. (See DPN Vol. 55, Nos. 15 and 21 and Vol. 56, No.1) TDH reported 29 cases of dengue in 1995: 9 from Hidalgo County, 5 from Harris County, 4 from Cameron County, 4 from Dallas County, 2 from Fort Bend County, and 1 each from Bell, Collin, Hays, Tarrant, and Waller Counties. Dengue virus was isolated from 3 patients. The first isolate, from a patient residing in Hidalgo County, was DEN-2; the second, from a patient in Cameron County, was DEN-4; and the third, from a Dallas resident, was DEN-3. Neither the patient with DEN-2 nor the patient with DEN-4 had a travel history. Four cases from Hidalgo County and 3 from Cameron County were locally acquired. The remaining 22 patients had travel histories. Twelve persons had been to Mexico. The others had been to the Caribbean (4), El Salvador (2), Honduras (2), or Guatemala (1), areas where dengue was epidemic. The patient with DEN-3 drove through Mexico and Guatemala to El Salvador. Two patients had onset of illness in March, 2 in July, 5 in August, 9 in September, 7 in October, 2 in November, and 2 in December. Symptoms included fever (29 patients), arthralgias/bone pain (26), headache (24), chills (21), myalgias (18), anorexia (18), severe malaise (17), rash (16), lumbosacral pain (12), nausea/ vomiting (12), dysgeusia (11), retro-orbital pain (9), dysesthesia (7), respiratory symptoms (7), petechiae, purpura, or epistaxis (3), and lymphadenopathy (4).  Dengue in Texas: 1995 On August 25, 1995, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, approximately 10 miles from McAllen, Texas. By the end of December, 2,361 cases were reported. An additional 430 cases of dengue were reported from  Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 5  People can eliminate dengue vector breeding sites by removing, emptying, or covering containers of water. Therefore, health officials in Mexico and Texas are attempting to avert an outbreak in 1996 through public health education campaigns. In May bilingual pamphlets, Prevent Dengue by Stopping the Mosquito Life Cycle, were distributed to children attending public schools in South Texas. In addition, a slide presentation detailing the epidemiology of dengue will soon be available through TDH regional offices and the TDH film library. Since most dengue cases occur from August through December, the 1996 season is imminent. Healthcare workers should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have symptoms similar to those of dengue, particularly u u  when they also have a history of recent travel to areas associated with risk. The TDH Laboratory performs viral isolation and serologic tests. Whole blood, serum, or CSF (collected within 5 days of onset) should be placed on dry ice and shipped overnight for viral isolation. Single serum specimens may be submitted at ambient temperature for antibody detection. Convalescent sera (collected 10 to 14 days after the acute specimen was drawn) may be required to confirm recent infection. Send specimens to Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Laboratories, 1100 West 49th Street, Austin, Texas 78756.

The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States and at least 2 other countries. The Rainbow Gathering in Missouri this year is the second to be associated with a shigella outbreak. Of approximately 12,000 persons who attended the gathering held in North Carolina, July 1987, an estimated 1,200 became ill with shigella. The first S.sonnei case was culture confirmed on July 8. As of July 26, the Missouri Public Health Laboratory (MPHL) had confirmed 21 cases, with additional suspected cases still under investigation. The organism is resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The home residences of these 21 case-patients are as follows: Missouri (3); California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, and Oregon (2 each); Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Tennessee (1 each); and Germany (1). The standard treatment protocol being used at this time is ciprofloxacin, 500 mg, twice a day for 3 days (for a total of 6 doses). Of the estimated 500 Rainbow Gathering participants who remain, 30%40% are reportedly ill. As of July 26, 2 giardia cases also have been confirmed. (One of the giardia cases was in an individual who also had culture-confirmed S. sonnei). The MDH investigation and laboratory testing is still in progress. Self-described as a ""disorganization of nonmembers,"" the Rainbow Family has gathered on public land in different locations every year since July 4, 1972. For the week-long festival, participants refuse to sign permits, citing their First Amendment right to assemble peaceably. Organizers began setting up camp in Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest on June 12. Participants camped in the forest and ate communally. Drinking water was obtained from nearby springs and creeks that were also used for bathing. Continued F  The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States ....   Page 6  August 5, 1996  DPN  In light of health problems connected with previous Rainbow Gatherings, the large number of participants at this event, and their nonstandard approach to public hygiene, MDH initiated the following control measures. Active surveillance was begun at local hospitals on June 23, hospital staff were asked to report all health conditions treated in Rainbow Family members, and laboratory testing was included in evaluation of diarrheal cases.  S. sonnei infection causes an acute diarrheal disease that often lasts only 1 to 3 days; many individuals do not seek medical care for this type of illness. When they do, many are treated empirically, and stool cultures are not obtained. Because a large number of people from all over the US and 2 other countries attended the Rainbow Gathering in Missouri last month, and because the S. sonnei strain responsible for this outbreak is multidrug resistant--TDH recommends that physicians obtain stool specimens from patients with diarrheal illness. Cases possibly associated with the Missouri outbreak should be reported by calling (800) 252-8239. All other shigella cases should be reported to the local health authority by calling the statewide number, (800) 705-8868.  Shigella in Texas S. sonnei accounted for 1,555 (52%) of the 3,017 shigella cases reported in Texas in 1995. Texas law requires that shigellosis be reported to the Texas Department of Health on a weekly basis. For a variety of reasons, however, many S. sonnei cases probably are not reported.  Note: As of August 1, 1996, cryptosporidium infections and ehrlichiosis were added to the list of reportable diseases. In addition TDH has limited the reporting of invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections to H. influenzae type b infections only.  Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area As of July 26, 1996, investigation continues of a measles outbreak that began in Harris County; 1 case has also been confirmed in Liberty County. Rash onset for the first culture-confirmed case was May 9, and for the most recent case was July 22. The clinical case definition of measles is as follows: generalized rash lasting 3 or more days PLUS temperature of 101F or higher PLUS cough or coryza or conjunctivitis. The rash usually breaks out on the face and spreads to the chest, arms, and legs. To date, 16 cases have been confirmed. Of the 16 case-patients, 9 were children 7 to 9 years of age, 1 was 13 years old, and 6 were younger than 4 years of age. Seven case-patients had received 1 dose of measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two boys, brothers 8 and 9 years of age, were unvaccinated due to invalid contraindications. An additional 5 patients, aged 9 to 18 months were also unvaccinated. Two of these patients were below the minimum age for MMR. TDH recommends that infants 6 to 11 months of age residing in the Harris County area be vaccinated with the single-antigen measles vaccine, if available. If not, MMR may be given. Children aged 1 to 4 years should have 1 dose (preferably 2) of MMR vaccine. Persons in other areas of the state should follow TDH standard recommendations: a first dose of MMR at 12 months of age and a second dose at 4 years of age. All persons 4 years of age or older born on or after January 1, 1957 should have at least 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine, preferably 2 doses of MMR. Report all suspected cases of measles IMMEDIATELY by calling (800) 252-9152.  It takes 2 doses of measles vaccine to assure protection against measles.   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 7  Perspectives in Public Health: Texas Department of Health (TDH) Quarterly CME Conference On September 20, 1996, from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) will present its Perspectives in Public Health: TDH Quarterly CME Conference.

It occurred in two forms: variola major, which killed 20% or         more of its victims, and variola minor, which killed 1%. (1) In its         typically widespread epidemics, one percent was often rendered in the         thousands.    Smallpox began         somewhat like the flu, with chills, high fever, nausea, and aches.         Within a few days, however, its characteristic rash of unsightly,         painfully swollen pustules declared itself. The disease spread with         devastating ease from one individual to another by way of droplets from         the nose and mouth (for example, in sneezing), contact with the dried         scabs of the pustules, or even contact with clothing or articles used by         people with smallpox. It took about 12 days from exposure to the time         the disease became evident; consequently, care givers of people with         smallpox often caught the disease and then followed the first wave of         victims to the grave within a matter of weeks                               The numbers of people killed by smallpox in previous         centuries are so large that they are numbing. Some authors credit         smallpox with the collapse of both the Aztec and Incan empires, (2)         civilizations that had prospered for centuries in South America, Mexico,         and nearly halfway into the North American continent.            Some historians think smallpox emerged when humans first began to         grow their own food, around 12,000 years ago.  (3)  From that         time forward, every human era was marked by the presence of smallpox.         Anthropologists have determined that eruptions evident on the skin of an         Egyptian mummy of the 20th dynasty (1200-1100 B.C.) originated in         smallpox. (4) From the earliest days of Europe, epidemics hung like a         perpetual thundercloud over human society. As Thomas Babington Macaulay,         a 19th-century British historian and statesman, (5) observed, ""The         havoc of the [bubonic, or ""black""] plague had been far more         rapid: but plague had visited our shores only once or twice within         living memory; and the smallpox was always present....""(6) In 1519,         the Spanish brought the disease to Mexico, where three and a half         million Indians died. (7) In the 17th and 18th century, entire tribes in         North America were wiped out by smallpox. (8) In the North American         colonies, those who could, would flee to the countryside when the first         case in a new epidemic appeared. (9) Epidemics often followed the course         of a river or trails taken by traders and explorers. Many people who         survived this highly contagious disease bore its mark forever in         unsightly scars, and many were left blind. However, survivors truly         triumphed, because having the disease and surviving it made them immune         to having it again. Recognizing a similar, crossover effect in milkmaids         who contracted cowpox--they appeared to be immune to smallpox--Dr.         Edward Jenner began late 17th- and early 18th-century efforts to rid         humanity of this scourge.           On May 14, 1796, Dr. Jenner performed an experiment that         demonstrates how desperate people were to find some way to prevent this         terrible scourge. He inoculated (vaccinated) a boy with matter taken         from pustular cowpox lesions. Several weeks later, he challenged the         success of the first inoculation by vaccinating the boy with smallpox.         It was a tremendous risk, but it worked. The boy didn't develop         smallpox. . Following publication of the results in June 1798, Jenner         predicted the eventual eradication of smallpox. It took more than two         centuries to prove him correct.           Jenner was hardly the first to observe that inoculation could         prevent disease. Folk methods had been tried in many cultures, most of         them relying herbs, magic, religious objects, prayers, incantations, and         ultimately, luck. In some countries where more than one God was         worshiped, there were gods to whom one prayed specifically for         protection against smallpox.  (11)  Medical practitioners in a         number of ancient cultures had made observations about resistance to         smallpox and had experimented with methods of immunization. Around 1700,         nearly a century before Dr. Jenner's experiment, the practice of         variolation--inoculation of a healthy person with pus from an infected         person's smallpox lesions--was first tried in England, but the practice         is believed to have originated in Africa and was learned from slaves.         (12) In 1716, Cotton Mather, a member of the clergy, author, scholar,         and physician in Boston, (13) sent Dr. John Woodward, an English         physician, a vivid description of inoculation, as it had been described         to him by one of his slaves, Anesimus. (14) The difference between the         African method and Jenner's method was that Jenner involved a third         party (cows) and a milder form of the disease (cowpox). His work opened         the door to immunization as we know it today.

Through         massive vaccination efforts, smallpox has been wiped out. This historic         victory occurred in this century, in the lifetimes of today's         grandparents, parents, and children.           The one weakness of the variola (smallpox) virus is that it         survives by being passed from one person to another. Public health         officials worldwide joined together in the 1970s to take advantage of         this weakness. They undertook to interrupt the cycle of smallpox through         an intensive immunization and monitoring effort. In effect, by         immunizing humans, they were removing the human incubator from the         cycle, one vaccination at a time.           This was a huge task, involving many densely populated         countries with limited health, technology, and communications         facilities. Nevertheless, the effort succeeded. The last case of variola         major occurred on Bhola Island in Bangladesh in October, 1975. The last         case of variola minor was in Ethiopia in August, 1976. Although smallpox         had been a nearly constant companion for twelve millennia, no one         grieved over its quiet departure.           Because smallpox has been eradicated, smallpox vaccination         has ceased everywhere. Travelers no longer need certificates to prove         vaccination against this disease. (15) The children born at the end of         this century may be puzzled by the small, round scars on their parents'         and grandparents' upper left arms, the last scars left by smallpox.

GX233-37-11579423	"History of Tuberculosis       TB has a lineage that can be traced to the earliest history of mankind.       The tubercle bacillus, the organism that causes TB disease, can be traced as far     back as 5000 BC when archeologists found evidence in human bones of the existence in human     bones of the existence of TB.  Evidence was found in ancient Egyptian mummies which     showed deformities consistent with TB disease.         Evidence of TB appears in Biblical scripture, in Chinese literature dating     back to around 4000 BC, and in religious books in India around 2000 BC.  In ancient     Greece Hippocrates mentions TB around 400 BC. as does Aristotle, who talked about     ""phthisis and its cure""(ca. 350 BC).       It was thought that Columbus brought TB to the new world in 1492, but     evidence was found in 1994, when scientists reported that they had identified TB bacterium     DNA in the mummified remains of a woman who died in the Americas 500 years before Columbus     set sail for the New World.       The ""Great White Plague"" which started in Europe in the 1600's     and continued for 200 years was Tuberculosis.  Other names through out history for     tuberculosis are Phthisis(from the Greek word to waste away), scrofula(swellings of the     lymph nodes of the neck), consumption(progressive wasting away of the body), and TB(the     presence or products of the tubercle bacillus).       In 1720, in his publication,  A New Theory of Consumption,  the     English physician Benjamin Marten was the first to conjecture that TB could be caused by     ""wonderfully minute living creatures,"" which, once they had gained a foothold in     the body, could generate the lesions and symptoms of the disease.  He continued that     ""It may be therefore very likely that by an habitual lying in the same bed with a     consumptive patient, constantly eating and drinking with him, or by very frequently     conversing so nearly as to draw in part of the breath he emits from the Lungs, a     consumption may be caught by a sound person.  I imagine that slightly conversing with     consumptive patients is seldom or never sufficient to catch the disease.""  For a     physician living in such an early era, Dr. Marten showed much medical insight.       In 1882, at a time when TB was raging through Europe and the Americas,     killing one in seven people, a German biologist by the name of Robert Koch presented to     the scientific community his discovery of the organism that caused TB.  It was called     a tubercle bacillus because small rounded bodies (tubercles) occurred in the diseased     tissue and where characteristic of the disease.  Through his many experiments with     the organism, Dr. Koch worked on developing a cure for TB.  Koch was able to isolate     a protein from the tubercle bacillus that he tried as an immunizing agent and later as a     treatment for TB; in both cases it failed.  However, the substance called ""old     tuberculin,"" was to be later used as the screening tool (tuberculin skin tests) for     identifying people and animals infected with tubercle bacilli.       A further significant advance came in 1895 when Wilhelm Konrad von     Roentgen discovered the radiation (x-rays) that bears his name.  This allowed the     progress and severity of a patient's disease to be accurately followed and reviewed.       TB in America during the colonial period was accepted as a scourge of     humanity that was common to the poor and rich alike.  The first available mortality     figures from Massachusetts in 1796 indicated 300 deaths per 100,000 population.  The     peak mortality figure reached in New England was 1,600 per 100,000 in 1800.  With the     industrial development, the epidemic traveled to the Midwest in 1840 and to the West in     1880.  The American Indians and Alaskans were the last American populations to become     effected by the TB epidemic.  At the turn of the century it was estimated that 10% of     all deaths in the United States were due to TB.       In 1886, Edward Livingston Trudeau a physician who recovered from TB,     started the sanatorium movement in the United States at Saranac Lake, New York.  He     based it on the European model of strict supervision in providing fresh air and sunshine,     bed rest, and nutritious foods.  As infection control measures took hold in large     urban centers of the country, TB patients who could not be treated in local dispensaries     were removed from the general population and place into sanatoriums.   By 1938     there were more than 700 sanatoriums throughout the U.S., yet the number of patients     outnumbered the beds available.       In 1892, Dr. Herman Biggs of New York started mandatory reporting of TB     cases.  He thought that we should:               educate the public of the dangers that the disease posed to the person         and his/her contacts.                 properly dispose of and immediately destroy sputum or the         ""discharges from the lungs"" of the individuals with disease.                 Have all physicians of pulmonary cases report such cases to the health         department.                 Have health inspectors visit the families where TB exists and deliver         proper literature and take specific measures to disinfect the areas as may be required.                 Obtain and submit sputum specimens to the laboratory for analysis                 Create a consumptive hospital to care for indigent patients.                     The board adopted most of the recommendations made by Biggs, including the     creation of the Consumptive Hospital.  These recommendations created a storm of     controversy among the medical community.  Many private doctors objected to the     mandatory reporting, believing that it violated physician-patient confidentiality.       Because of the resistance from the medical community, reporting practices were not fully     implemented for several years.  In the end, Biggs' recommendations to the Board and     their implementation in New York City created the model for TB control programs that was     emulated by other health departments across the country and laid the groundwork for a     campaign called the ""War on Consumption.""       In 1904 a voluntary health agency was organized under the National     Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, later renamed the National     Tuberculosis Association (NTA) and now known as the American Lung Association.       On November 20, 1944, the antibiotic ""Streptomycin"" was     administered for the first time to an critically ill TB patient. The effect was almost     immediate and impressive.  His advanced disease was visibly arrested, the bacteria     disappeared from his sputum, and he made a rapid recovery.  The new drug had side     effects - especially on the inner ear - but the fact remained,  M. Tuberculosis      was no longer a bacteriological exception; it could be assailed and beaten into retreat     within the human body.       A rapid succession of anti-TB drugs appeared in the following years.       These were important because with streptomycin monotherapy, resistant mutants began     to appear within a few months, endangering the success of antibiotic therapy.       However, it was soon demonstrated that this problem could be overcome with the combination     of two or three drugs.       Turning the Page on a New Century               Each year there are 2 million TB-related deaths worldwide.                 One person dies from TB every 10 seconds                 An estimated 2 billion people are infected with TB                 8 million people around the world become sick with TB each year.

GX260-99-12733719	"APPENDIX C:  HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS  METHODS FOR GROWING HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS IN VITRO To grow cultures of human ES cells, Thomson and his collaborators used 36 fresh or frozen embr yos generated in IVF laboratories from couples undergoing treatment for infertility. From the 14 embr yos that developed to the blastocyst stage, they established 5 human ES cell lines--H1, H7, H9, H13 and H14 [35]. Four of the 5 lines were derived from frozen embr yos provided to Thomson's laborator y by Josef ItskovitzEldor, of the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel. The ES cell line from the fifth, fresh embr yo was derived from an embr yo donated in Wisconsin. To generate human ES cell cultures, cells from the inner cell mass of a human blastocyst were cultured in a multi-step process. The pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass were separated from the surrounding trophectoderm by immunosurger y, the antibodymediated dissolution of the trophectoderm. The inner cell masses were plated in culture dishes containing growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum on feeder layers of mouse embr yonic fibroblasts that had been gamma-irradiated to prevent their replication. After 9 to 15 days, when inner cell masses had divided and formed clumps of cells, cells from the peripher y of the clumps were chemically or mechanically dissociated and replated in the same culture conditions. Colonies of apparently homogeneous cells were selectively removed, mechanically dissociated, and replated. These were expanded and passaged, thus creating a cell line. None of the initial 5 human ES cell lines generated in this manner was derived clonally (cloned from a  single cell and are, therefore, genetically identical) [35] (see Figure C.1. Techniques for Generating Embr yonic Stem Cell Cultures). The five original human ES cell lines continued to divide without differentiating for 5 to 6 months [35]. Since then, the H9 line has divided for nearly two years in vitro, for more than 300 population doublings and has yielded two subclones, H9.1 and H9.2 [1] 1. All the ES cell lines express high levels of telomerase [1, 36], the enzyme that helps maintain telomeres which protect the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity and long telomeres are characteristic of proliferating cells in embr yonic tissues and of germ cells. Human somatic cells, however, do not show telomerase activity and their telomeres are considerably shorter. Unlike ES cells, differentiated somatic cells also stop dividing in culture--a phenomenon called replicative senescence (see Figure C.2. Telomeres and Telomerase). Three of the human ES cell lines generated by Thomson were XY (male) and two were XX (female); all maintained a normal kar yotype. Like monkey ES cells [34], human ES cells express a panel of sur face makers that include the stage-specific embr yonic antigens SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, as well as TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase [14, 25, 26, 35]. Mouse ES cells do not express SSEA-3 or SSEA-4; they express SSEA-1, which human and monkey ES cells do not. Human ES cells also express the transcription factor Oct-4 [26], as mouse ES cells do. A somewhat different technique for deriving and culturing human ES cells has now been reported by  1  The H9.1 and H9.2 clonal cell lines were produced by first plating 105 of the parent H9 cells per well in tissue-culture plates. The culture medium contained KnockOut Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (a serum-free substitute for the 20% fetal bovine serum used in the 1998 experiments), and basic FGF, which is necessar y to maintain cell proliferation and prevent differentiation. To generate clonal cell lines from individual H9 ES cells, 384 single cells were removed from these cultures and transferred individually to the wells of larger plates that contained non-dividing mouse embr yonic fibroblasts (MEF) as feeder layers. The single ES cells proliferated and, ever y 7 days, were dissociated and replated, a process that generate two clonal cell lines, H9.1 and H9.2.

Telomeres and Telomerase. A telomere is a repeating sequence of double-stranded DNA located at the ends of chromosomes. Greater telomere length is associated with immortalized cell lines such as embr yonic stem cells and cancer cells. As cells divide and differentiate throughout the lifespan of an organism or cell line, the telomeres become progressively shortened and lose the ability to maintain their length. Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres by adding on repeating sequences of DNA. Telomerase binds to the ends of the telomere via an RNA template that is used for the attachment of a new strand of DNA. Telomerase adds several repeated DNA sequences then releases and a second enzyme, DNA Polymerase, attaches the opposite or complementar y strand of DNA completing the double stranded extension of the chromosome ends. High levels of telomerase activity are detected in embr yonic stem cells and cancer cells, whereas little or no telomerase activity is present in most mature, differentiated cell types. The functions of telomeres and telomerase appear to be important in cell division, normal development, and aging.  C-3   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  investigators in Singapore and Australia. The human blastocysts are cultured in Singapore, where monolayer cultures of human ES cells growing on feeder layers are prepared. The primar y cultures are shipped to Australia, where the colonies of growing cells are dissociated mechanically and replated. LIF and fetal bovine serum are added to the growth medium. The cells do not grow well without serum, although it is not clear that LIF has any effect. Under these in vitro conditions, the ES cells tend to clump and differentiate spontaneously as they are passaged. In vivo, after injection into the testes of immunocompromised mice, the ES cells differentiate into bone, cartilage, squamous and cuboidal epithelium, neural cells, glandular epithelium, and striated muscle [25, 26]. Six human ES cell lines have been generated from 12 blastocysts, a high yield by any standard. The original two cell lines were generated from fresh embr yos; the other four cells lines were generated from frozen embr yos [23]. Recent reports have identified additional human ES cell lines that have been developed. New derivations have been conducted from the blastocyst of frozen embr yos at two centers in India (National Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore; Harkishondas Hospital in collaboration with Reliance Biotechnology, Bombay). They used derivation techniques that differ from those of the Thomson laborator y including the use of laser ablation for the removal of the inner cell mass [22, 24, 33, 36]. An additional preparation of human ES cell lines has been conducted in San Francisco [10]. There are no publications to date on these cell lines and the extent of the research being conducted is not known. By several criteria, all of the human ES cell lines generated to date are pluripotent. When injected under the skin or into the testes of immunocompromised mice--an in vivo method of determining pluripotency --the human ES cells form teratomas that contain derivatives of all three primar y germ layers. When allowed to differentiate in vitro (by culturing the cells in the absence of MEF feeder layers), the human ES cells differentiate spontaneously. Subsequent studies indicate that in vitro differentiation of these human ES cell lines is extensive; the cells can generate many cell types that are derived from all three primar y germ layers [1, 14, 25, 26]. However, the extent to which these human ES cell lines will differentiate in vitro does not match their more extensive differentiation capability in vivo (in teratomas) [19].  METHODS FOR THE DERIVATION AND CULTURE OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS To derive cultures of human embr yonic germ (EG)-like cells, Gearhart and his colleagues grew cells from 38 initial cultures of primordial germ cells (PGC), which were obtained from the gonadal ridge and mesenter y of 5 to 9-week gestation fetal tissue. (PGCs give rise to the germ cells, eggs and sperm, in the adult.) The PGCs were mechanically and chemically dissociated, then plated on a feeder layer of non-dividing, mouse STO fibroblasts in growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum [31]. Unlike the growth conditions initially reported for human ES cells [35], the medium for human PGCs cells also contained the cytokine, leukemia inhibitor y factor (LIF), a mitogen (basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF), and forskolin. After one to three weeks in vitro, the human PGCs had formed dense, multilayered colonies of cells that resembled mouse ES or EG cells. Cells in these colonies expressed SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA1-60, TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase. A small, variable percentage (1 to 20 %) of the PGC-derived cell colonies spontaneously formed embr yoid bodies. The growth medium for embr yoid body cultures lacked LIF, bFGF, and forskolin. The embr yoid bodies were collected from the cultures and either examined for the cell types they contained, or replated into single wells of a tissue culture plate for 14 days. The range of cell types in the human PGC-derived embr yoid bodies included derivatives of all three embr yonic germ layers--endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm--based on the appearance of the cells and the sur face markers they expressed. This result was interpreted to mean that the PGC-derived cells were pluripotent, however, it was not possible to demonstrate pluripotency in vivo by generating the formation of teratomas in mice [31]. In their next series of experiments, Gearhart and his collaborators devised methods for growing stem cells derived from human EG cells. The process requires the generation of embr yoid bodies, which form spontaneously from EG cells that remain attached to the substrate. The embr yoid bodies then float freely in the culture medium. Each embr yoid body consists of an unpredictable mix of partially differentiated cell types, but allowing the embr yoid bodies to form is the most  C-4   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  consistent way of allowing EG-derived cells to differentiate [11]. The process involves several stages of cell derivation in a different kinds of growth media. Cells from low-serum cultures were passaged, chemically dissociated, and resuspended in a culture media that contains 50% fetal bovine serum, and frozen in this state. To measure proliferation, cultures are derived from the frozen embr yoid bodies and grown in the same media used to grow the dissociated cells. Clonal cell lines are then derived from the embr yoid body-derived cultures [32]. The embr yoid body-derived cells resulting from this process have high proliferative capacity and gene expression patterns that are representative of multiple cell lineages. This suggests that the embr yoid bodyderived cells are progenitor or precursor cells for a variety of differentiated cell types [11]. Recently, Neil Hanley and David Wilson from the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, have derived EG cells from the primordial germ cells of the fetal gonadal ridge. Using material at 8 -10 weeks gestation, cells were derived slightly differently form the methods of Shamblott et al using a combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder layers and gelatin coated tissue culture dishes [12]. This method and the further characterization of the alkaline phosphatase/ SSEA1-positive EG cells currently remains unpublished.  growth factor (bFGF). Other growth factors, such as activin-A and transforming growth factorbeta 1 (TGF-1) trigger the differentiation of mesodermallyderived cells. Two other factors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and ner ve growth factor (NGF), promote differentiation into all three germ layers, including endoderm. When these eight growth factors were added individually to cell cultures derived from embr yoid bodies (generated from the H9 line from Thomson's laborator y), the cells differentiated into 11 cell types that represented all three germ layers. The identify of the differentiated human embr yoid bodyderived cells was determined by their morphology, growth characteristics and expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for specific markers [30] (see Figure A.6 Gene Transcription, Translation, and Protein Synthesis). Human embr yoid body-derived cells will differentiate spontaneously into many kinds of cells, without the addition of growth factors. However, the addition of one of a number of growth factors resulted in cultures that were more likely to be populated by only one or two types of differentiated cells, as measured by mRNA transcripts expressed by the cells. Human embr yoid body-derived cultures treated with bFGF differentiated largely into epidermal epithelial cells that express keratin, a protein in skin. Cells in activinAtreated cultures formed muscle cell-like syncytium --fused, multinucleated populations of similar cells-- that express the enzyme muscle-specific enolase. And cultures treated with retinoic acid differentiated into cells that resemble neurons and express neurofilament H. However, the same growth factor typically induced the expression of multiple markers; none of the resulting cell populations was homogeneous [30]. Spontaneous differentiation of human ES cells into hematopoietic cells, which form all the lineages of blood cells, is rare in vitro. However, by co-culturing human ES cells with mouse bone marrow stromal cells (irradiated to prevent their replication) in growth medium that contains fetal bovine serum, but no added growth factors, the cells differentiate to form what appear to be hematopoietic precursor cells. The partly differentiated cells express CD34, a marker for blood cell precursors. If these partly differentiated human ES cells are replated under conditions that allow them to form colonies of hematopoietic cells, they differentiate into er ythroid cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and megakar yocytes [19] (see Chapter 5. Hematopoietic Stem Cells).  DIRECTED DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS IN VITRO As with cultures of mouse ES cells, human ES cells begin to differentiate if they are removed from feeder layers and grown in suspension culture on a nonadherent sur face. The human ES cells form embr yoid bodies which, in the early stages, may be simple or cystic and filled with fluid. Although human embr yoid bodies var y in their cellular content, many include cells that look like neurons and heart muscle cells [14, 25, 26]. After the human embr yoid bodies form, they can be dissociated and replated in monolayer cultures which are then exposed to specific growth factors that influence further cell differentiation. Some growth factors induce cell types that would normally be derived from ectoderm in the embr yo; these include retinoic acid, epidermal growth factor (EGF), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and basic fibroblast  C-5   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  As indicated, human ES cells maintained in vitro have tendency to differentiate spontaneously, a characteristic that may not always be desirable. Thus, it may be necessar y to devise methods that allow undifferentiated ES cells be selected from a culture that contains a mixture of differentiated, partially differentiated, and undifferentiated cells types. The undifferentiated ES cells could then be used for the purposes of directed differentiation, or they could be removed from cultures in which the differentiated cell types are the desired product. In either case, a suggested method for identifying undifferentiated ES cells is to introduce a marker gene--such as that encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP)--whose expression is driven by a gene that is specifically expressed in proliferating, undifferentiated cells, such as Rex1. Then, undifferentiated cells that express GFP can be selectively removed from human ES cultures by using a fluorescence activated cells sorter (FACS) [9] (see Appendix E.i. Markers: How Do Researchers Use Them to Identify Stem Cells?). Joseph Itskovitz-Eldor and his colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into cardiac myocytes. They use several of the human ES lines generated in James Thomson's laborator y. They report a number of cells in embr yoid bodies that have contractile activity and express genetic markers consistent commonly found in cardiac myocytes [16] (see Chapter 9. Can Stem Cells Repair a Damaged Heart?). Karl Skorecki and his collaborators have had success in directing the differentiation of human ES cell lines (originating from the Thomson laborator y derivation) into pancreatic islet-like cells that secrete insulin. They have also reported the expression of insulin genes found in islet-like cells of the pancreas [6] (see Chapter 7. Stem Cells and Diabetes). A new report indicates that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of human EG cells into neuronal cells that may play a role in restoring some function to paralyzed animals. The SDEC human cell line in this study was generated from embr yoid bodies that formed in culture by the aggregation of human EG cells, and is referred to as an embr yoidderived cell line. SDEC cells express a panel of neuronal markers that include nestin, neurofilament, tau protein, neuron-specific enolase; the cells also express the glial cells markers glial fibrillar y acidic protein, galactocerebroside, and CNPase. No in vitro assays that indicate cell function have been reported  for SDEC cell assays. However, when SDEC cells were injected into the central canal of the spinal cord of rats--whose hind limbs were paralyzed by an induced form of amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease)--the majority of animals showed some functional recover y. It is not clear whether the human embr yoid body-derived cells replaced some of the spinal motor neurons damaged by the experimental ALS, or whether the injected cells triggered neurons in the recipient animals to recover lost function [17] (see Chapter 8. Rebuilding the Ner vous System with Stem Cells). Several groups of investigators are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cell lines, but their work is not yet published. They reported their findings in inter views with the NIH or during presentations at scientific meetings. They include, but are not limited to, the following:  Martin Pera, Alan Trounson, and their coworkers are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells along a neural lineage using the BMP antagonist noggin. They generate an apparently homogenous population of cells, but have not yet characterized it [23].  Brenda Kahan, Jon Odorico, and their coworkers are tr ying to direct the differentiation of the human ES lines H1 and H9 into pancreatic islet cells, which are endodermal derivatives. They induce the formation of embr yoid bodies in medium lacking bFGF and assay cultures for the expression of transcripts for the endodermal markers hnf3, lfabp, ifabp, and villin 1. Differentiated progeny from these cells express the genes for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, which are normally expressed in pancreatic islet cells [15].  Micha Drukker, Nissim Benvenisty, and their colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neurons by adding retinoic acid or -NGF to the growth medium. They report that about 80% of embr yoid bodies exposed to these factors contain differentiated neuronal cells, as determined by morphology and the expression of receptors for dopamine or serotonin [8].  Su-Chang Zhang, James Thomson, and their collaborators are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neural epithelial cells, by  C-6   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  selecting cells from embr yoid bodies that express nestin, glial fibrillar y acidic protein (GFAP , an astrocyte marker), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and Musashi-1. The differentiated cell types express (as yet unidentified) markers of neurons and glial cells. After transplantation into the mouse brain, the cells aggregated into clusters and migrate into the brain parenchyma where they express (unidentified) neural and glial markers. By 10 weeks after transplantation, the human embr yoid-derived cells had not formed teratomas [38].  Margaret Inokuma, Melissa Carpenter, and their colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neural cells using neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF). Some of the resulting cells stain positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the ratelimiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis) or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), an inhibitor y neurotransmitter [13].  Chunhui Xu, Melissa Carpenter, and their colleagues report preliminar y data on growing human ES cells in vitro in serum-free medium without feeder layers. The details of their method have not been published but apparently include Matrigel or laminin as a substrate, basic FGF, and conditioned medium from cultures of mouse embr yo fibroblasts [39].  J.S. Lebkowski and Margaret Inokuma et al. report methods for using genetic modification and changes in culture conditions to direct the differentiation of the human ES cell lines H1 and H7 in vitro. They grow undifferentiated human ES cells in serum-free medium on Matrigel or laminin, and then add 20% serum replacement medium plus DMSO to direct the first stage of differentiation. The second stage is induced by adding sodium butyrate to the medium. Cell maturation occurs in a third medium (not described). To induce differentiation into neural cells, they allow the human ES cells to form embr yoid bodies, which are then expanded, and plated in B27 medium (not described), with FGF and EGF. The resulting cells express the neural progenitor markers psNCAM and A2B5.  Some differentiated cells express the glial marker GFAP Other cells express the neuronal markers . -tubulin III and synaptophysin, or stain for the neurotransmitters GABA, tyrosine hydroxylase, or glutamate. No quantitative data, electrophysiological data, or responses to neurotransmitter application are reported [18].  HUMAN EMBRYONIC CARCINOMA CELLS Embr yonal carcinoma (EC) cells are the ""stem cells"" that occur in unusual germ cell tumors, also called teratocarcinomas. As such, they give rise to the differentiated cell types that also occur in the tumors. The tumors probably arise from a malignant form of a primordial germ cell. In humans, germ cell tumors occur most often in the testis of young men; these are always malignant, but usually treatable. Benign germ tumors called ovarian cysts can occur in the ovar y; malignant ovarian germ cell tumors are much rarer (malignant ovarian tumors  usually referred to as ovarian cancer  are not germ cell tumors). Germ cell tumors have been studied extensively in humans and mice. They contain an aberrant mix of differentiated cell types, rather than a single kind of tumor cell. Small groups of the cells may appear organized, but overall, the tissue in the tumor is disorganized. Teratocarcinomas are of particular interest because they contain EC cells, which in many ways resemble normal ES cells [4]. Like human ES cells, human EC cells proliferate extensively in vitro and in teratomas formed in vivo after injection into immunocompromised mice. Because research on human ES cells is so recent, a direct comparison of cultured human EC cells and human ES cells has just begun.2 Both cell types express a panel of sur face markers, including the embr yonic stage-specific antigens SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. Neither human ES cells nor human EC cells expresses SSEA-1, as mouse ES and EC cells do [5, 26, 35]. Conversely, mouse EC and ES cells do not express SSEA-3 or SSEA-4. Human EC and ES cells also carr y on their surfaces keratin sulfate proteoglycans that can be labeled with specific antibodies, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 [3, 7]. Also, unlike their mouse counterparts,  2  As of May 9, 2001, the comparisons between human ES cells and EC cells have been made only in Peter Andrews' laborator y at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. James Thomson, of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, supplied Andrews with four lines of human ES cells [3, 32].  C-7   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  human ES and EC cells express MHC Class I antigens, which are responsible for immunogenicity (see Chapter 6. Autoimmune Diseases and the Promise of Stem Cell-Based Therapies). Like mouse ES and EC cells, undifferentiated human ES and EC cells strongly express the transcription factor Oct-4 [26, 4], which is widely regarded as a hallmark of pluripotent embr yonic cells [20, 28, 29] (see Table C.1. Comparison of Mouse, Monkey, and Human Pluripotent Stem Cells).  Human ES and EC cells differ in important ways. Human ES cells are euploid, meaning they carr y the normal complement of chromosomes. In contrast, human EC cells are aneuploid; their chromosomes are distinctly abnormal. (Interestingly, the chromosomes in mouse EC cells do not appear as abnormal, although they do carr y subtle chromosomal abnormalities.) The ability of both cell types to differentiate into various tissue types has been explored by injecting human ES and EC cells into  Table C.1.

Injected human ES cells will form embr yonic stem cell teratomas in mice, and the tumors consist of cells derived from all three primar y germ layers [36]. In contrast, human EC cell lines var y in their ability to differentiate in vivo, but in general are more limited than are ES cells. For example, NTERA2 cl.D1 cells (which are derived from human TERA2 EC cells) generate only a few kinds of tissues, including primitive gut-like structures, and neural tissue after injection into immunocompromised mice [2]. The in vitro growth characteristics of human ES and EC cells are also being compared. Both cell types grow well in serum-containing medium on feeder layers of mouse embr yonic fibroblasts that have been treated to block their proliferation. It is difficult to induce human ES cells to proliferate in the absence of feeder layers, unless conditioned medium from feeder cells cultures is added. However, many human EC cells lines, such as the NTERA2 line, are not dependent on feeder layers [2]. If human ES cells are removed from their feeder layers, they differentiate spontaneously into many cell types. Mouse ES cells, after removal from feeder layers, can be stimulated to divide and prevented from differentiating by adding LIF (leukemia inhibitor y factor); neither human ES nor EC cells show this response to LIF. Instead, if human ES cells grow to confluence (where the cells grow to completely cover the culture plates), the cells aggregate and begin to differentiate spontaneously [26, 35]. Also, human ES cells grown in suspension cultures at high density will form embr yoid bodies. Embr yoid bodies are clumps or groupings of cells that form when cultured in plates or media and do not occur in nature. Embr yoid bodies contain undifferentiated and partially differentiated cells [14]. However, human EC cells remain undifferentiated when grown at high density [4]. Whether these apparent differences in the in vitro growth characteristics of human ES and EC cells are meaningful or real is subject to debate [5]. The pluripotency of human EC cells does not equal that of human ES cells. Human ES cells can differentiate into a wide range of cell types in vitro, and can form teratomas with many cell types after injection into immune-deficient mice. The differentiation potential of most lines of human EC cells is more limited, both in vitro and in vivo. One human EC cell line, however, TERA2, differentiates easily in vitro. The  well-studied morphogen, retinoic acid, induces TERA2 cells (and the subline NTERA2) to differentiate into neural precursors, which can then become mature neurons [4]. But when human ES cells are exposed to retinoic acid, they differentiate into a wider array of cell types than do human EC cells. As yet, it is not clear how the mechanism of action of retinoic acid differs in human ES cells versus human EC cells. It may be that, because of their tumor origin, human EC cells carr y genetic variations linked to tumorigenesis that restrict their capacity for differentiation [5]. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of human EC cells resembles that of human ES cells in certain respects, but not in others. Although ES cells will likely prove to be a better model for understanding human development than will EC cells [27], there may be some aspects of development that EC cells will reveal that ES cells will not [5].

GX257-06-13972502	Poster #1 (Presenter's Name Is Underlined) Alternative Methods for Culturing Human Embryonic Stem Cells Amit, M., Margulets, V., Shariki, K., and Itskovitz-Eldor, J. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Introduction: The availability of human embryonic stem (hES) cells reflects their outstanding potential for research areas, such as human developmental biology, teratology, and cell-based therapies. To allow their continuous growth in an undifferentiated state, isolation and culturing were traditionally conducted on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers, using medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. However, these conditions allow the possible exposure of the cells to animal pathogens. Because both research and future clinical application require an animal-free and well-defined culture system for hES cells, these conditions would prevent the use of hES cells in human therapy. This study confronts this challenge and describes optional culture conditions based on medium supplemented with serum replacement. Methods: hES cell lines I3, I6, I3.2, and H9 were transferred from the MEF culture system to medium supplemented with 15% SR and 4ng/ml bFGF on either MEF matrix, foreskin fibroblast matrix, Matrigel matrix, or fibronectin. When fresh (and unconditioned) medium was used, additional known growth factors were added. Following a prolonged culture of more than 20 passages, cells were examined for ES cell characteristics. Results: All hES cell lines maintained their ES cell features: They continued to proliferate as undifferentiated cells for at least 20 passages as demonstrated by the expression of undifferentiated-specific surface markers; when grown in suspension for over 17 passages, they formed embryoid bodies similar to those formed on MEFs; in vivo, the cells created teratomas containing representative tissues of the three embryonic germ layers, and normal karyotypes were retained. All matrices were found to support hES cell culture with the same efficiency. Conclusions: The culture system presented here has two major advantages: (1) the elimination or significant restriction of hES cells' exposure to animal pathogens and (2) the application of a well-defined culture system.
GX256-11-6067611	"Stem cells are special cells in the body that have not yet committed themselves to a final function. As illustrated by this diagram, a stem cell can differentiate into a number of different cell types (represented by the different colors) that may then be part of the same organ or tissue, such as the pancreatic islet cell cluster represented at the bottom. As they learn how to guide the development of stem cells present in adult tissues, researchers may be able to develop therapies for a number of diseases in which these tissues are damaged or malfunctioning.

While the ultimate application of such basic research is not always obvious to the public, major strides in fighting disease can be traced back to laboratory studies whose immediate relevance to health could not have been fully known or appreciated at the time they were conducted. Described here are some recent studies of fundamental processes, as well as the technologies that make such studies possible. The insights gained through this type of research can be expected to propel disease-oriented research, not only within the NIDDK mission, but also in many other fields. Investment in such cross-cutting scientific research today will have future applications that we cannot now describe with certainty, but which we know will surely be realized.  A  F UNCTIONAL G ENOMICS : T OOLS FOR D ISCOVERING THE F UNCTIONS OF G ENES R ELEVANT TO D ISEASE  I  n the quest for new and better treatments for disease, bbiomedical scientists are creating and using exciting advances in modern technology to discover important genes and learn their functions at an ever-increasing rate. This knowledge can propel new advances in diagnostics and drug development. Because different diseases and medical conditions arise from disparate causes--mutations in genes, infectious agents, and even adverse reactions to certain medical therapies--scientists delve into the inner workings of living cells with a great diversity of approaches. In genetic research, genes are often identified, and clues to their function obtained, by investigating what goes wrong when a gene is mutated, as is the case in many diseases. The study of genes has been revolutionized by modern functional genomics, the use of largescale, high-throughput techniques to discover the 5  function of genes and how all the genes in the genome of an organism work together. For example, scientists can now scan hundreds or thousands of genes at a time to see which may be active in a certain type of cell. For cases in which a disease is caused by a mutation in a gene that is already known from previous research, new technologies are also expediting experiments in which scientists generate an animal with an analogous mutation. From the animal model of the disease, they can learn how the disease progresses and what other genes may be involved, and they can use these animal models to test candidate therapies that are not yet ready for human trials. Because most genes are blueprints for the construction of specific proteins, scientists also gain critical insights into disease by studying how proteins function--or malfunction--when genes are mutated. In parallel with investigations into the causes of particular diseases, researchers also seek to build upon fundamental knowledge of genes and their functions to perpetuate the cycle of scientific discovery: critical insights and breakthroughs in medicine are often predicated upon the accumulation of such knowledge and upon the development of new technologies. Thus, investment in genetic and genomic research can be expected to have cross-cutting implications, advancing medical research within the NIDDK mission and in other fields as well. Modeling the Control of Cell Growth Through Mice: Cancer is the result of uncontrolled cell growth. Normally, the body regulates when a cell should grow and divide to produce new cells where they are needed, and when the growth should stop. A cell must also carefully monitor its genome as it grows to ensure that if mutations arise, they are not propagated into new cells. How this elaborate regulatory system breaks down to allow mutant cells to grow into tumors has been the subject of much research. Mouse models of cancer are particularly useful to researchers precisely because they provide insights into the development of cancer in the context of a whole Cross-Cutting Science   organism, where all of the regulatory systems should normally be in place. Cell Growth and DNA Damage in Breast Cancer: Breast cancer strikes approximately one in nine women. It can be caused by new mutations or by mutations that were inherited. Many of the hereditary cases of breast cancer are caused by mutations in the gene BRCA1. BRCA1 appears to be a central player in many biological pathways, including regulating cell growth and maintaining the integrity of the genome through repair of DNA damage. Thus, mutations in this gene are particularly insidious because without BRCA1, cells are left vulnerable to acquiring even more mutations. While some mutations are caused by environmental factors, other mutations just occur spontaneously in cells. One of the body's defenses against DNA damage is to have cells die rather than perpetuate potentially harmful mutations; this programmed cell death is called ""apoptosis."" How do some BRCA1 mutant cells escape death and instead grow uncontrollably into tumors? Scientists recently deduced that some of these cells do so by mutating the protein that imposes the death sentence: this protein is called p53. In studies in mice, NIDDK-funded scientists found that BRCA1 mutations resulted in massive numbers of dead cells as a result of apoptosis. This was likely in response to DNA damage, the result of the accumulation of many spontaneously arising mutations left unchecked in the absence of BRCA1. Surprisingly, this massive cell death was not seen in mice that both lacked BRCA1 and additionally had a mutation that impaired p53 function--and most of these mice eventually developed breast tumors. These results are particularly significant to human cancer because BRCA1-associated tumors have a relatively high frequency of p53 mutations. Mutations in p53 have long been associated with many types of human cancers. One possible reason for this is that p53 can suppress uncontrolled cell growth in several ways, including by triggering cell death. To further investigate the interactions between p53 and BRCA1, the researchers induced extensive DNA damage in mice by exposing them to radiation. The cells of normal mice bolstered their levels of p53 protein to help protect against the damaging effects of the radiation, but in mice with BRCA1 mutations, the p53 response was impaired. These results help show that in normal cells, BRCA1 and p53 must coordinate to protect Cross-Cutting Science 6  against conditions that can lead to cancer. These experiments suggest a mechanism for BRCA1mediated tumor formation. In the absence of normal BRCA1 function, mutations accumulate in the DNA. In some cells, this DNA damage eventually strikes the gene encoding the p53 protein, causing a mutation that destroys it. Once p53 function is lost, these mutant cells can escape death, continue to grow and divide, and eventually form tumors. The mice developed in this study, with BRCA1 and p53 mutations, will continue to be of value to increase our understanding of cancer progression; these mice may also serve as useful models to test new treatments for breast cancer. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia: Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a cancer syndrome characterized by multiple tumors in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, anterior pituitary, and other parts of the body. It is caused by mutations in a gene called MEN1 (for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1), which was discovered by the collaborative efforts of NIH scientists from the NIDDK, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Human Genome Research Institute. To gain further insight into this cancer syndrome, scientists recently generated a mouse model of the disease. Like humans, mice have two copies of the MEN1 gene. Using genetic engineering, the researchers mutated one of these copies. The mice developed symptoms remarkably similar to human multiple endocrine neoplasia, including tumors in the pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary, and other tissues. The scientists observed that the tumor cells had spontaneously lost the remaining normal copy of the MEN1 gene. Future research on these mice may reveal whether other genetic events accompany tumor formation. Ultimately, as current therapies for this syndrome are often unsatisfactory, the availability of a mouse model should be an asset for the testing of possible new therapeutic approaches. Unfolding Protein Folding: Just as gears and wires must be perfectly crafted to make a machine work, the proteins of the human body must assume very distinct shapes to perform the functions necessary for life. A gear of the wrong shape or a mass of wires tangled randomly together will disrupt a machine's function. Likewise, an improperly-shaped protein, or certain aggregates of proteins interacting abnormally, can lead to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's and ""mad cow"" disease. Proteins are chains of amino acid building blocks; the   nature and order of amino acids in each protein are dictated by the sequence of the gene encoding the protein. Each amino acid chain must ""fold"" into a particular intricate shape so that the protein can function. A mutation in a gene that changes the nature of even just one of the amino acids can make it impossible for the protein to fold properly. A few types of proteins seem to be able to change their structure spontaneously--more alarmingly, some of these proteins sabotage the folding of other proteins, even in the absence of genetic mutations. Proteins that can do this after infecting a living organism are called prions. Research on prions and on abnormal aggregates of misshaped proteins, called amyloids, continues to shed light on protein-folding diseases and will lead to new ideas for treatment approaches. Prions and Amyloids in a Yeast Model System: Many diseases that ravage the brain, such as the much-feared mad cow disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are caused by infectious proteins called prions. In recent years, creative experiments by NIDDK-funded scientists in a seemingly unlikely model system--baker's yeast--have provided insights not only into prion formation, but also into amyloids, which are abnormal forms of protein observed in many diseases. Yeast are ideal model organisms for investigating many biological processes because they are readily amenable to highly sophisticated genetic manipulation and other experimental techniques; they require little storage and growth space; and they are relatively inexpensive to grow. (Such features would contrast sharply, for example, with a herd of ""mad cows"" that one might wish to study.) Yeast also have their own set of prions which, like those of animals and people, often start out as normal proteins but then spontaneously change into a sinister form. Prions propagate by converting other proteins into this abnormal form. One such yeast prion is called [URE3], which is an altered form of a normal yeast protein called Ure2p. Scientists recently learned that yeast prions such as [URE3] do not propagate by themselves: they use other proteins, called chaperones, as unwitting accomplices to help them convert more Ure2p proteins into [URE3] prions. Further experiments showed that [URE3] prions aggregate together to form networks of amyloid filaments, which resemble amyloid found in a number of human diseases, including Alzheimer's, late-onset diabetes, multiple myeloma, and transmissible spongi7  form encephalopathies. Continued research on yeast prions will generate further insights into both prion disease and amyloid formation and propagation. Protein Folding in Amyloid Disease--Implications for Therapy: A recent study of the disease familial amyloid polyneuropathy explained an intriguing case of two genetic wrongs making a right. The disease is caused by a mutant version of the protein transthyretin. People have two copies of the gene for transthyretin, one from each parent. If one copy is normal, but the other copy codes for a protein with a mutation called ""V30M,"" then disease occurs. (V30M is a shorthand designation that scientists use to note that the 30th amino acid building block of the protein is mutant. The chemical nature of the defect is abbreviated by the letters V and M.) Curiously, individuals are protected from disease if the second copy of the transthyretin gene--rather than being normal--has a different mutation, called ""T119M."" NIDDK-funded scientists recently discovered how the T119M mutation overcomes the adverse effects of the V30M mutant. Transthyretin proteins usually snap together in groups of four, but the V30M mutation renders them unable to maintain this normal configuration. Separated from the group, the individual proteins with the V30M mutation begin to unfold, lose their characteristic shape, and then aggregate in a harmful mass that interferes with nerve and muscle function. By contrast, scientists found that proteins with the T119M mutation exert an especially stabilizing influence on the transthyretin group, even if the foursome includes some of the V30M mutants. (Not all mutations, then, are bad.) The extra stability of the T119M version of transthyretin counteracts the unfolding propensity of the proteins carrying the V30M mutation. The implications of this finding are that this amyloid disease--and potentially others like it, such as Alzheimer's--may be amenable to treatment strategies designed to stabilize the proper groups of proteins to prevent misfolding. ""Insights"" into the Digestive System--Feeding Fluorescent Fats to Zebrafish: In a clever new approach to identify genes involved in fat processing, scientists combined modern genetic techniques with glow-in-the-dark fats. The model organisms they used, zebrafish larvae, process fats in the intestine and liver and respond to cholesterol-blocking drugs in a manner similar to humans. Thus, genes identified as important in zebraCross-Cutting Science   fish for fat processing are likely to be important in humans also. Zebrafish are common pets throughout the world. In recent years, however, they have acquired a new purpose: they have become established as a powerful model organism for biological research. Zebrafish are readily amenable to genetic manipulation, facilitating the identification and characterization of genes. They are vertebrates, with organ systems similar to those of people and other mammals. Because zebrafish are relatively small, scientists can maintain large numbers of them in the lab. Zebrafish also have a striking characteristic that makes them particularly valuable for studying how internal organs and tissues are formed: during their rapid development, the fish embryos and larvae are transparent, permitting their insides to be viewed easily. Thus, the zebrafish can be a virtual window to enable researchers to see how cells differentiate and organs develop. Exploiting the ability to synthesize fluorescent fats and the ability to perform sophisticated experiments on zebrafish, NIDDK-funded scientists screened for and identified zebrafish larvae with mutations that disrupt proper fat processing. After these mutant larvae were fed fluorescent fats, their gall bladders did not glow as brightly as those of normal larvae. Thus, the scientists can deduce that the genes that were mutated must be important for fat processing. By tracking down the location of the mutations within the genome, the researchers will eventually be able to find and study these important genes. One of the mutants, nick-named ""fat-free,"" had a digestive tract that otherwise appeared normal. Thus, without the use of fluorescent fat technology to detect a defect, this mutant would have been overlooked, and potentially valuable insights into the genetics of the digestive system would have been missed. This research predicts that genetic screens in zebrafish, along with sensitive fluorescent fat technology, may identify genes important for diseases of fat metabolism, biliary disorders, and even certain types of cancer in which fat signaling plays a role. With support from multiple NIH components under the leadership of the NIDDK and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the community of scientists who study zebrafish have been developing sophisticated genomics tools to facilitate the mapping and identification of important genes and to determine their functions. An effort to sequence the entire zebrafish genome is now beginning. Cross-Cutting Science 8  Using a Genetic Database to Prevent Blood Transfusion Reactions: Blood transfusions save the lives of accident victims, surgery patients, and people suffering from blood disorders such as dialysis-induced anemia, sickle cell anemia, and Cooley's anemia. However, patients can develop an adverse reaction to transfused blood if certain molecules displayed on the surface of the donor red blood cells differ from those on the patient's own cells. There are many groups of such surface molecules, including the group used to classify blood into the commonlyknown A, B, or O types. Among the many other blood groups is one called the Dombrock group, named after a blood donor named Dombrock in 1965. A reaction against a surface molecule of the Dombrock group can cause the destruction of transfused blood cells as well as fever, chills, and other symptoms. However, reliable products have not been available to screen blood for the Dombrock type. Recently, with modern large-scale genomic techniques, NIDDK-funded investigators working at the NIH discovered the gene coding for the Dombrock molecules. They began with two clues from prior research. First, genetic studies had linked the Dombrock gene to chromosome 12. Second, research on red blood cells suggested that the Dombrock molecules are anchored to the cell membrane in a specific way. The scientists prepared DNA from developing red blood cells (because mature red blood cells lack chromosomes) and generated a database of 5,000 genes that are active in these cells. They then screened this database to look for a gene that both localized to chromosome 12 and that also had a sequence characteristic of molecules that are anchored to cell membranes in the same way as the Dombrock molecules. The strategy worked. Over thirty years after the initial identification of Dombrock blood types, the gene that encodes the Dombrock molecules has now been cloned. The scientists were even able to find versions of the gene with slight sequence variations that correlate with the different types of Dombrock molecules. With this breakthrough, gene-based methods can now be developed to screen patients, and also donor blood, for Dombrock type. This type of screen would allow doctors to match a patient with donor blood of the same Dombrock type to reduce painful transfusion reactions. This research also illustrates the value of a database of genes that function in red blood cells. Such a database will undoubtedly propel further discoveries in red blood   cell biology in order to better understand and treat human diseases involving these cells. With this as a goal, NIDDK is supporting the development of a large database, called ""Hembase,"" to provide worldwide access to genetic-based studies of red blood cells performed by scientists working at the NIH. Taking Tools into the Future--Building Knowledge of Disease Genes: The NIDDK is continuing to advance biomedical research by identifying and pursuing cross-cutting areas of research within its mission that can be addressed with recent and developing technologies. Modifier genes: The symptoms and severity of all diseases vary from one person to the next due to differences in genetic makeup and environmental exposure. For many medical disorders, a mutation in a single gene plays the predominant role in the development of disease. However, even among those who have identical mutations in such a gene, the severity of the disease can vary. To better understand this phenomenon, it is necessary to find other genes, called ""modifier genes,"" that contribute to this variability. Identifying these modifier genes would improve our ability to predict the symptoms and severity of a disease in a particular individual, and may lead to improved treatments. With the primary genes for many diseases now known, the NIDDK will strive to build upon our understanding of the genetics of these diseases by stimulating research to identify modifier genes. A planned symposium on the search for modifier genes will encompass such diseases as cystic fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease, Gaucher disease, and other disorders within the NIDDK mission. Increasing Understanding of Membrane Transport: Cell membranes are like the walls of a house, with windows and doors that can open to the outside and to interior rooms. On a much smaller but far more elaborate scale, the membranes of living cells are designed to let nutrients and other molecules pass through in a highly-regulated fashion. Many diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, renal tubular acidosis, congestive heart failure, and several intestinal disorders, arise from defects in the transport of substances across membranes. Membrane transport processes in humans and other mammals are very similar to those in lower organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, among others. These similarities can be exploited to build upon our knowledge of membrane transport because these non-mammalian 9  organisms are also easily experimentally-manipulated (more so than mammals), and the genome sequences for many of these are also known. The NIDDK plans to support innovative approaches to studying membrane transport in bacteria, yeast, zebrafish, and other nonmammalian organisms, and to search for novel genes and discover how they function. This knowledge will lead to important insights into the workings of human cells and membrane transport-associated diseases. Beta Cell Biology Consortium: Central to the onset and progression of diabetes are abnormalities in cells called beta cells. Beta cells reside in the pancreas and produce insulin, a hormone that is essential for life. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells are destroyed, so no more insulin is produced. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not respond properly to insulin; the beta cell initially compensates by secreting extra insulin but eventually fails, leading to overt diabetes. It is believed that signaling defects involving beta cells are at the root of insufficient insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes. A comprehensive understanding of beta cells will therefore lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches for both forms of this devastating disease. The NIDDK has launched a functional genomics initiative to identify the genes that are critical for beta cell development and to learn how they function. To build on this initiative, the NIDDK proposes to establish a Beta Cell Biology Consortium. Through the Consortium, individual Beta Cell Biology Programs would have access to information, resources, technologies, expertise, and reagents that are beyond the scope of any single research effort. The goals of the Consortium will be to advance our knowledge of beta cell biology and to develop technologies that will have implications for early detection of disease, for therapeutic transplantation of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, and for understanding derangements of cell signaling and regulation in type 2 diabetes. Progenitor Cell Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs): The successful treatment of many chronic and debilitating diseases afflicting Americans today will depend on the ability to replace organs or to stimulate regeneration and recovery of damaged organs. To build upon the achievements of the Human Genome Project, the NIDDK and other NIH institutes have established a range of Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs) to map the complex network of cellular interactions in normal and diseased tissues. In the NIDDK, for example, one new initiative is the Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project, which will look at the Cross-Cutting Science   expression of genes in pancreatic and other tissues affected by diabetes. Now, complementary new research initiatives will apply this same comprehensive approach to focus on progenitor cells. Progenitor cells develop into different types of cells that form the organs and tissues of the body. It is important to understand how tissues and organs develop from progenitor cells, and how progenitor cells maintain and regenerate tissues and organs in health and disease. Approaches will include developing biomarkers to detect and classify stem cells and progenitor cells; profiling the cells to catalogue genes that are active; and creating tools for characterizing the functions of these genes. Such research would not only capitalize on the sequence data from the Human Genome Project, but could also take full advantage of human embryonic stem cell lines which meet established criteria for use in research supported by the NIH. It is also a goal that wellcharacterized cells, DNA, and specific tools for progenitor cell analysis developed by the GAPs will be distributed to the broader research community. Further, the development of bioinformatics systems, including databases, will ensure that data produced are available to researchers worldwide soon after being generated in the laboratories.

S  TEM  C  ELLS  :D  EVELOPING  P  OTENTIAL  S  cientists are striving to understand the processes that boccur during normal development, when a vast number of different cell types are generated from a single fertilized egg. If they can understand normal development, scientists will have a better chance of determining how to recapitulate development in an adult in order to replace cells damaged by disease. Even within adults, special cells known as stem cells retain the ability to divide, and the divisions can give rise either to more stem cells or to cells that will differentiate into specific cell types. This process is analogous to harvested wheat seeds: the farmer can use the seeds either to plant more wheat, as when stem cells divide to produce more stem cells, or to produce specific products such as bread, as when stem cells divide to produce cells that differentiate into specific cell types. Currently, scientists are determining the usefulness of different types of stem cells for treating human disease. Until now, replacement of cells has only been possible via organ or cell transplantation. Doctors are unable to treat every needy patient with transplantation, however, because there are limited supplies of donated cells and organs. Stem cells are heralded as a possible means for overcoming this treatment barrier. The various types of stem cells are believed to differ mainly in the limits of their ""potential""--their ability to produce other cell types. Embryonic stem cells arise early in development. Because they must give rise to all the different cell types and tissues of the body, embryonic stem cells are thought to have almost unlimited potential. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, reside within a mature tissue or organ and are thought to be able to differentiate into a more limited number of cell types. Experiments are still being performed to test the validity of these assumptions. In the past year, NIDDK-funded scientists studying stem cells have made a number of exciting discoveries. Investigators identified a population of adult stem cells present in both rat and human pancreas capable of generating all types of pancreatic cells in culture. Investigators studying adult stem cells in the blood were surprised to discover that they are capable of producing not only numerous types of blood cells, but also liver, lung, gut, and skin cells. Another team showed that stem cells of the adult mouse pancreas are capable of producing both  Cross-Cutting Science  10   pancreas and liver cells. Still another group of investigators developed a new technique for expanding cultured umbilical cord stem cells in order to generate enough cells for a transplant. These studies have all advanced our progress towards developing alternative sources of cells for transplantation to treat human diseases. The NIDDK is supporting several efforts designed to capitalize on and extend previous stem cell and developmental biology discoveries and to stimulate new discoveries. As previously mentioned, two Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs) support the use of advanced technologies and bioinformatic techniques to describe gene expression patterns in stem cells both during development, and in adult stem cells during tissue maintenance and tissue repair following disease. The planned Progenitor Cell GAPs will support research to identify and describe stem cells located within specific tissues of the gastrointestinal lining, liver, exocrine pancreas, kidney, urinary tract, prostate, and bladder. Hematopoietic Cell Lineage GAPs will support work to describe gene expression in blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. Another NIDDK effort will sponsor studies to describe normal development and stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and exocrine pancreas. The NIDDK hopes that knowledge gained from these studies will enable doctors to use stem cells and developmentally-regulated genes to repair and replace damaged and diseased tissue.

Introduction Research on how healthy scientists to regenerative stem cells is advancing knowledge about how an organism develops from a single cell and cells replace damaged cells in adult organisms. This promising area of science is also leading investigate the possibility of cell-based therapies to treat disease, which is often referred to as or reparative medicine.  Stem cells are one of the most fascinating areas of biology today. But like many expanding fields of scientific inquiry, research on stem cells raises scientific questions as rapidly as it generates new discoveries. The NIH developed this primer to help readers understand the answers to questions such as: What are stem cells? What different types of stem cells are there and where do they come from? What is the potential for new medical treatments using stem cells? What research is needed to make such treatments a reality? A. What are stem cells and why are they important? Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can functions such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or the them from other types of cells. First, they through cell division. The second is that be induced to become cells with special insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.  Scientists primarily work with two kinds of stem cells from animals and humans: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells, which have different functions and characteristics that will be explained in this document. Scientists discovered ways to obtain or derive stem cells from early mouse embryos more than 20 years ago. Many years of detailed study of the biology of mouse stem cells led to the discovery, in 1998, of how to isolate stem cells from human embryos and grow the cells in the laboratory. These are called human embryonic stem cells. The embryos used in these studies were created for infertility purposes through in vitro fertilization procedures and when they were no longer needed for that purpose, they were donated for research with the informed consent of the donor. Stem cells are important for living organisms for many reasons. In the 3 to 5 day old embryo, called a blastocyst, a small group of about 30 cells called the inner cell mass gives rise to the hundreds of highly specialized cells needed to make up an adult organism. In the developing fetus, stem cells in developing tissues give rise to the multiple specialized cell types that make up the heart, lung, skin, and other tissues. In some adult tissues, such as bone marrow, muscle, and brain, discrete populations of adult stem cells generate replacements for cells that are lost through normal wear and tear, injury, or disease. It has been hypothesized by scientists that stem cells may, at some point in the future, become the basis for treating diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease. Scientists want to study stem cells in the laboratory so they can learn about their essential properties and what makes them different from specialized cell types. As scientists learn more about stem cells, it may become possible to use the cells not just in cell-based therapies, but also for screening new drugs and toxins and understanding birth defects. However, as mentioned above, human embryonic stem cells have only been studied since 1998. Therefore, in order to develop such treatments scientists are intensively studying the fundamental properties of stem cells, which include: 1) determining precisely how stem cells remain unspecialized and self renewing for many years; and 2) identifying the signals that cause stem cells to become specialized cells. B. Scope of this document This primer on stem cells is intended for anyone who wishes to learn more about the biological properties of stem cells, the important questions about stem cells that are the focus of scientific research, and the potential use of stem cells in research and in treating disease. The primer includes information about stem cells derived from the embryo and adult. Much of the information included here is about stem cells derived from human tissues, but some studies of animal-derived stem cells are also described. II. What are the unique properties of all stem cells? Stem cells differ from other kinds of cells in the body. All stem cells -- regardless of their source -- have three general properties: they are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods; they are unspecialized; and they can give rise to specialized cell types. Stem Cells for the Future Treatment of Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is a very common neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 2% of the population over 65 years of age. PD is caused by a progressive degeneration and loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons, which leads to tremor, rigidity, and hypokinesia (abnormally decreased mobility). It is thought that PD may be the first disease to be amenable to treatment using stem cell transplantation. Factors that support this notion include the knowledge of the specific cell type (DA neurons) needed to relieve the symptoms of the disease. In addition, several laboratories have been successful in developing methods to induce embryonic stem cells to differentiate into cells with many of the functions of DA neurons. In a recent study, scientists directed mouse embryonic stem cells to differentiate into DA neurons by introducing the gene Nurr1. When transplanted into the brains of a rat model of PD, these stem cell-derived DA neurons reinnervated the brains of the rat Parkinson model, released dopamine and improved motor function. Regarding human stem cell therapy, scientists are developing a number of strategies for producing dopamine neurons from human stem cells in the laboratory for transplantation into humans with Parkinson's disease. The successful generation of an unlimited supply of dopamine neurons could make neurotransplantation widely available for Parkinson's patients at some point in the future.   Scientists are trying to understand two fundamental properties of stem cells that relate to their long-term self-renewal: 1) why can embryonic stem cells proliferate for a year or more in the laboratory without differentiating, but most adult stem cells cannot; and 2) what are the factors in living organisms that normally regulate stem cell proliferation and self-renewal? Discovering the answers to these questions may make it possible to understand how cell proliferation is regulated during normal embryonic development or during the abnormal cell division that leads to cancer. Importantly, such information would enable scientists to grow embryonic and adult stem cells more efficiently in the laboratory. Up to Top Stem cells are unspecialized. One of the fundamental properties of a stem cell is that it does not have any tissue-specific structures that allow it to perform specialized functions. A stem cell cannot work with its neighbors to pump blood through the body (like a heart muscle cell); it cannot carry molecules of oxygen through the bloodstream (like a red blood cell); and it cannot fire electrochemical signals to other cells that allow the body to move or speak (like a nerve cell). However, unspecialized stem cells can give rise to specialized cells, including heart muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells. Stem cells are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods . Unlike muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells -- which do not normally replicate themselves -- stem cells may replicate many times. When cells replicate themselves many times over it is called proliferation. A starting population of stem cells that proliferates for many months in the laboratory can yield millions of cells. If the resulting cells continue to be unspecialized, like the parent stem cells, the cells are said to be capable of long-term self-renewal. The specific factors and conditions that allow stem cells to remain unspecialized are of great interest to scientists. It has taken scientists many years of trial and error to learn to grow stem cells in the laboratory without them spontaneously differentiating into specific cell types. For example, it took 20 years to learn how to grow human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory following the development of conditions for growing mouse stem cells. Therefore, an important area of research is understanding the signals in a mature organism that cause a stem cell population to proliferate and remain unspecialized until the cells are needed for repair of a specific tissue. Such information is critical for scientists to be able to grow large numbers of unspecialized stem cells in the laboratory for further experimentation. Stem cells can give rise to specialized cells . When unspecialized stem cells give rise to specialized cells, the process is called differentiation. Scientists are just beginning to understand the signals inside and outside cells that trigger stem cell differentiation. The internal signals are controlled by a cell's genes, which are interspersed across long strands of DNA, and carry coded instructions for all the structures and functions of a cell. The external signals for cell differentiation include chemicals secreted by other cells, physical contact with neighboring cells, and certain molecules in the microenvironment. Therefore, many questions about stem cell differentiation remain. For example, are the internal and external signals for cell differentiation similar for all kinds of stem cells? Can specific sets of signals be identified that promote differentiation into specific cell types? Addressing these questions is critical because the answers may lead scientists to find new ways of controlling stem cell differentiation in the laboratory, thereby growing cells or tissues that can be used for specific purposes including cell-based therapies. Adult stem cells typically generate the cell types of the tissue in which they reside. A blood-forming adult stem cell in the bone marrow, for example, normally gives rise to the many types of blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Until recently, it had been thought that a blood-forming cell in the bone marrow -- which is called a hematopoietic stem cell -- could not give rise to the cells of a very different tissue, such as nerve cells in the brain. However, a number of experiments over the last several years have raised the possibility that stem cells from one tissue may be able to give rise to cell types of a completely different tissue, a phenomenon known as plasticity. Examples of such plasticity include blood cells becoming neurons, liver cells that can be made to produce insulin, and hematopoietic stem cells that can develop into heart muscle. Therefore, exploring the possibility of using adult stem cells for cell-based therapies has become a very active area of investigation by researchers. Up to Top III. What are embryonic stem cells? A. What stages of early embryonic development are important for generating embryonic stem cells? Embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived from embryos. Specifically, embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized in vitro -- in an in vitro fertilization clinic -- and then donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors. They are not derived from eggs fertilized in a woman's body. The embryos from which human embryonic stem cells are derived are typically four or five days old and are a hollow microscopic ball of cells called the blastocyst. The blastocyst includes three structures: the trophoblast, which is the layer of cells that surrounds the blastocyst; the blastocoel, which is the hollow cavity inside the blastocyst; and the inner cell mass, which is a group of approximately 30 cells at one end of the blastocoel. B. How are embryonic stem cells grown in the laboratory? Growing cells in the laboratory is known as cell culture. Human embryonic stem cells are isolated by transferring the inner cell mass into a plastic laboratory culture dish that contains a nutrient broth known as culture medium. The cells divide and spread over the surface of the dish. The inner surface of the culture dish is typically coated with mouse embryonic skin cells that have been treated so they will not divide. This coating layer of cells is called a feeder layer. The reason for having the mouse cells in the bottom of the culture dish is to give the inner cell mass cells a sticky surface to which they can attach. Also, the feeder cells release nutrients into the culture medium. Recently, scientists have begun to devise ways of growing embryonic stem cells without the mouse feeder cells. This is a significant scientific advancement because of the risk that viruses or other macromolecules in the mouse cells may be transmitted to the human cells. Over the course of several days, the cells of the inner cell mass proliferate and begin to crowd the culture dish. When this occurs, they are removed gently and plated into several fresh culture dishes. The process of replating the cells is repeated many times and for many months, and is called subculturing. Each cycle of subculturing the cells is referred to as a passage. After six months or more, the original 30 cells of the inner cell mass yield millions of embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells that have proliferated in cell culture for six or more months without differentiating, are pluripotent, and appear genetically normal, are referred to as an embryonic stem cell line. Once cell lines are established, or even before that stage, batches of them can be frozen and shipped to other laboratories for further culture and experimentation. C. What laboratory tests are used to identify embryonic stem cells? At various points during the process of generating embryonic stem cell lines, scientists test the cells to see whether they exhibit the fundamental properties that make them embryonic stem cells. This process is called characterization. As yet, scientists who study human embryonic stem cells have not agreed on a standard battery of tests that measure the cells' fundamental properties. Also, scientists acknowledge that many of the tests they do use may not be good indicators of the cells' most important biological properties and functions. Nevertheless, laboratories that grow human embryonic stem cell lines use several kinds of tests. These tests include: growing and subculturing the stem cells for many months. This ensures that the cells are capable of long-term self-renewal. Scientists inspect the cultures through a microscope to see that the cells look healthy and remain undifferentiated. using specific techniques to determine the presence of surface markers that are found only on undifferentiated cells. Another important test is for the presence of a protein called Oct-4, which undifferentiated cells typically make. Oct-4 is a transcription factor, meaning that it helps turn genes on and off at the right time, which is an important part of the processes of cell differentiation   and embryonic development. examining the chromosomes under a microscope. This is a method to assess whether the chromosomes are damaged or if the number of chromosomes has changed. It does not detect genetic mutations in the cells. determining whether the cells can be subcultured after freezing, thawing, and replating. testing whether the human embryonic stem cells are pluripotent by 1) allowing the cells to differentiate spontaneously in cell culture; 2) manipulating the cells so they will differentiate to form specific cell types; or 3) injecting the cells into an immunosuppressed mouse to test for the formation of a benign tumor called a teratoma. Teratomas typically contain a mixture of many differentiated or partly differentiated cell types -- an indication that the embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types. D. How are embryonic stem cells stimulated to differentiate?  Figure 1. Directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Click here for larger image. As long as the embryonic stem cells in culture are grown under certain conditions, they can remain undifferentiated (unspecialized). But if cells are allowed to clump together to form embryoid bodies, they begin to differentiate spontaneously. They can form muscle cells, nerve cells, and many other cell types. Although spontaneous differentiation is a good indication that a culture of embryonic stem cells is healthy, it is not an efficient way to produce cultures of specific cell types. So, to generate cultures of specific types of differentiated cells -- heart muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells, for example -- scientists try to control the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. They change the chemical composition of the culture medium, alter the surface of the culture dish, or modify the cells by inserting specific genes. Through years of experimentation scientists have established some basic protocols or ""recipes"" for the directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into some specific cell types (Figure 1). (For more examples of directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells, see Chapters 5-9 and Appendices B and C of the NIH report ""Stem Cells: Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions"" go to http://stemcells.nih.gov/stemcell/scireport.asp) If scientists can reliably direct the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into specific cell types, they may be able to use the resulting, differentiated cells to treat certain diseases at some point in the future. Diseases that might be treated by transplanting cells generated from human embryonic stem cells include Parkinson's disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Purkinje cell degeneration, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, heart disease, and vision and hearing loss. Up to Top IV. What are adult stem cells? An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell found among differentiated cells in a tissue or organ, can renew itself, and can differentiate to yield the major specialized cell types of the tissue or organ. The primary roles of adult stem cells in a living organism are to maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found. Some scientists now use the term somatic stem cell instead of adult stem cell. Unlike embryonic stem cells, which are defined by their origin (the inner cell mass of the blastocyst), the origin of adult stem cells in mature tissues is unknown. Research on adult stem cells has recently generated a great deal of excitement. Scientists have found adult stem cells in many more tissues than they once thought possible. This finding has led scientists to ask whether adult stem cells could be used for transplants. In fact, adult blood forming stem cells from bone marrow have been used in transplants for 30 years. Certain kinds of adult stem cells seem to have the ability to differentiate into a number of different cell types, given the right conditions. If this differentiation of adult stem cells can be controlled in the laboratory, these cells may become the basis of therapies for many serious common diseases. The history of research on adult stem cells began about 40 years ago. In the 1960s, researchers discovered that the bone marrow contains at least two kinds of stem cells. One population, called hematopoietic stem cells, forms all the types of blood cells in the body. A second population, called bone   marrow stromal cells was discovered a few years later. Stromal cells are a mixed cell population that generates bone, cartilage, fat, and fibrous connective tissue. Also in the 1960s, scientists who were studying rats discovered two regions of the brain that contained dividing cells, which become nerve cells. Despite these reports, most scientists believed that new nerve cells could not be generated in the adult brain. It was not until the 1990s that scientists agreed that the adult brain does contain stem cells that are able to generate the brain's three major cell types -- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which are non-neuronal cells, and neurons or nerve cells. A. Where are adult stem cells found and what do they normally do? Adult stem cells have been identified in many organs and tissues. One important point to understand about adult stem cells is that there are a very small number of stem cells in each tissue. Stem cells are thought to reside in a specific area of each tissue where they may remain quiescent (non-dividing) for many years until they are activated by disease or tissue injury. The adult tissues reported to contain stem cells include brain, bone marrow, peripheral blood, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, skin and liver. Scientists in many laboratories are trying to find ways to grow adult stem cells in cell culture and manipulate them to generate specific cell types so they can be used to treat injury or disease. Some examples of potential treatments include replacing the dopamine-producing cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients, developing insulin-producing cells for type I diabetes and repairing damaged heart muscle following a heart attack with cardiac muscle cells. B. What tests are used for identifying adult stem cells? Scientists do not agree on the criteria that should be used to identify and test adult stem cells. However, they often use one or more of the following three methods: (1) labeling the cells in a living tissue with molecular markers and then determining the specialized cell types they generate; (2) removing the cells from a living animal, labeling them in cell culture, and transplanting them back into another animal to determine whether the cells repopulate their tissue of origin; and (3) isolating the cells, growing them in cell culture, and manipulating them, often by adding growth factors or introducing new genes, to determine what differentiated cells types they can become. Also, a single adult stem cell should be able to generate a line of genetically identical cells -- known as a clone -- which then gives rise to all the appropriate differentiated cell types of the tissue. Scientists tend to show either that a stem cell can give rise to a clone of cells in cell culture, or that a purified population of candidate stem cells can repopulate the tissue after transplant into an animal. Recently, by infecting adult stem cells with a virus that gives a unique identifier to each individual cell, scientists have been able to demonstrate that individual adult stem cell clones have the ability to repopulate injured tissues in a living animal. C. What is known about adult stem cell differentiation?  Figure 2. Hematopoietic and stromal stem cell differentiation. Click here for larger image. As indicated above, scientists have reported that adult stem cells occur in many tissues and that they enter normal differentiation pathways to form the specialized cell types of the tissue in which they reside. Adult stem cells may also exhibit the ability to form specialized cell types of other tissues, which is known as transdifferentiation or plasticity. Normal differentiation pathways of adult stem cells. In a living animal, adult stem cells can divide for a long period and can give rise to mature cell types that have characteristic shapes and specialized structures and functions of a particular tissue. The following are examples of differentiation pathways of adult stem cells (Figure 2). Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all the types of blood cells: red blood cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets. Bone marrow stromal cells (mesenchymal stem cells) give rise to a variety of cell types: bone cells (osteocytes), cartilage cells (chondrocytes), fat cells (adipocytes), and other kinds of connective tissue cells such as those in tendons. Neural stem cells in the brain give rise to its three major cell types: nerve cells (neurons) and two categories of non-neuronal cells -- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Epithelial stem cells in the lining of the digestive tract occur in deep crypts and give rise to several cell types: absorptive cells, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Skin stem cells occur in the basal layer of the epidermis and at the base of hair follicles. The epidermal stem cells give rise to keratinocytes, which migrate to the surface of the skin and form a protective layer. The follicular stem cells can give rise to both the hair follicle and to the epidermis. Adult stem cell plasticity and transdifferentiation. A number of experiments have suggested that certain adult stem cell types are pluripotent. This ability to differentiate into multiple cell types is called plasticity or transdifferentiation. The following list offers examples of adult stem cell plasticity that have been reported during the past few years. Hematopoietic stem cells may differentiate into: three major types of brain cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes); skeletal muscle cells; cardiac muscle cells; and liver cells. Bone marrow stromal cells may differentiate into: cardiac muscle cells and skeletal muscle cells. Brain stem cells may differentiate into: blood cells and skeletal muscle cells. Current research is aimed at determining the mechanisms that underlie adult stem cell plasticity. If such mechanisms can be identified and controlled, existing stem cells from a healthy tissue might be induced to repopulate and repair a diseased tissue (Figure 3). D. What are the key questions about adult stem cells? Many important questions about adult stem cells remain to be answered. They include:   How many kinds of adult stem cells exist, and in which tissues do they exist? What are the sources of adult stem cells in the body? Are they ""leftover"" embryonic stem cells, or do they arise in some other way? Why do they remain in an undifferentiated state when all the cells around them have differentiated? Do adult stem cells normally exhibit plasticity, or do they only transdifferentiate when scientists manipulate them experimentally? What are the signals that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells that demonstrate plasticity? Is it possible to manipulate adult stem cells to enhance their proliferation so that sufficient tissue for transplants can be produced? Does a single type of stem cell exist -- possibly in the bone marrow or circulating in the blood -- that can generate the cells of any organ or tissue? What are the factors that stimulate stem cells to relocate to sites of injury or damage?  Figure 3. Plasticity of adult stem cells. Click here for larger image. Up to Top V. What are the similarities and differences between embryonic and adult stem cells? Human embryonic and adult stem cells each have advantages and disadvantages regarding potential use for cell-based regenerative therapies. Of course, adult and embryonic stem cells differ in the number and type of differentiated cells types they can become. Embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body because they are pluripotent. Adult stem cells are generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. However, some evidence suggests that adult stem cell plasticity may exist, increasing the number of cell types a given adult stem cell can become. Large numbers of embryonic stem cells can be relatively easily grown in culture, while adult stem cells are rare in mature tissues and methods for expanding their numbers in cell culture have not yet been worked out. This is an important distinction, as large numbers of cells are needed for stem cell replacement therapies. A potential advantage of using stem cells from an adult is that the patient's own cells could be expanded in culture and then reintroduced into the patient. The use of the patient's own adult stem cells would mean that the cells would not be rejected by the immune system. This represents a significant advantage as immune rejection is a difficult problem that can only be circumvented with immunosuppressive drugs. Embryonic stem cells from a donor introduced into a patient could cause transplant rejection. However, whether the recipient would reject donor embryonic stem cells has not been determined in human experiments. Up to Top VI. What are the potential uses of human stem cells and the obstacles that must be overcome before these potential uses will be realized? There are many ways in which human stem cells can be used in basic research and in clinical research. However, there are many technical hurdles between the promise of stem cells and the realization of these uses, which will only be overcome by continued intensive stem cell research. Studies of human embryonic stem cells may yield information about the complex events that occur during human development. A primary goal of this work is to identify how undifferentiated stem cells become differentiated. Scientists know that turning genes on and off is central to this process. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to abnormal cell division and differentiation. A better understanding of the genetic and molecular controls of these processes may yield information about how such diseases arise and suggest new strategies for therapy. A significant hurdle to this use and most uses of stem cells is that scientists do not yet fully understand the signals that turn specific genes on and off to influence the differentiation of the stem cell. Human stem cells could also be used to test new drugs. For example, new medications could be tested for safety on differentiated cells generated from human pluripotent cell lines. Other kinds of cell lines are already used in this way. Cancer cell lines, for example, are used to screen potential anti-tumor drugs. But, the availability of pluripotent stem cells would allow drug testing in a wider range of cell types. However, to screen drugs effectively, the conditions must be identical when comparing different drugs. Therefore, scientists will have to be able to precisely control the differentiation of stem cells into the specific cell type on which drugs will be tested. Current knowledge of the signals controlling differentiation fall well short of being able to mimic these conditions precisely to consistently have identical differentiated cells for each drug being tested. Perhaps the most important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues   that could be used for cell-based therapies. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used to replace ailing or destroyed tissue, but the need for transplantable tissues and organs far outweighs the available supply. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Figure 4. Heart muscle repair with adult stem cells. Click here for larger image. For example, it may become possible to generate healthy heart muscle cells in the laboratory and then transplant those cells into patients with chronic heart disease. Preliminary research in mice and other animals indicates that bone marrow stem cells, transplanted into a damaged heart, can generate heart muscle cells and successfully repopulate the heart tissue. Other recent studies in cell culture systems indicate that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of embryonic stem cells or adult bone marrow cells into heart muscle cells (Figure 4). In people who suffer from type I diabetes, the cells of the pancreas that normally produce insulin are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. New studies indicate that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells in cell culture to form insulin-producing cells that eventually could be used in transplantation therapy for diabetics. To realize the promise of novel cell-based therapies for such pervasive and debilitating diseases, scientists must be able to easily and reproducibly manipulate stem cells so that they possess the necessary characteristics for successful differentiation, transplantation and engraftment. The following is a list of steps in successful cell-based treatments that scientists will have to learn to precisely control to bring such treatments to the clinic. To be useful for transplant purposes, stem cells must be reproducibly made to: Proliferate extensively and generate sufficient quantities of tissue. Differentiate into the desired cell type(s). Survive in the recipient after transplant. Integrate into the surrounding tissue after transplant. Function appropriately for the duration of the recipient's life. Avoid harming the recipient in any way. Also, to avoid the problem of immune rejection, scientists are experimenting with different research strategies to generate tissues that will not be rejected. To summarize, the promise of stem cell therapies is an exciting one, but significant technical hurdles remain that will only be overcome through years of intensive research. The NIH has a wide array of new scientific programs designed to support research that uses embryonic stem cell lines. VII. Where can I get more information?

GX253-57-11200634	Use of Human Embryonic Stem Cells In NIH Supported Intramural and Extramural Research On August 9, 2001, at 9:00 p.m. EDT, the President announced his decision to allow Federal funds to be used for research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines as long as prior to his announcement (1) the derivation process (which commences with the removal of the inner cell mass from the blastocyst) had already been initiated and (2) the embryo from which the stem cell line was derived no longer had the possibility of development as a human being. In addition, the President established the following criteria that must be met: - The stem cells must have been derived from an embryo that was created for reproductive purposes; - The embryo was no longer needed for these purposes; - Informed consent must have been obtained for the donation of the embryo; - No financial inducements were provided for donation of the embryo. In order to facilitate research using human embryonic stem cells, the NIH is creating a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry that will list the human embryonic stem cell lines -- at varying stages of development -- that meet the eligibility criteria. Entities that have developed stem cell lines that meet the President's criteria and are therefore eligible for federal funding are listed at the following location: http://escr.nih.gov.

The Working Group supported this research area and proposed an embryonic stem cell data workshop to standardize data collection and facilitate data comparisons among laboratories. A greater  -2-   availability of human embryonic stem cell lines to the scientific community was seen as essential. The W orking Group saw the need f or Institute-sponsored stem cell research centers, such as the Specialized Centers of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCORs) to encourage collaborative teams with multi-disciplinary basic and clinical investigators, including an assessment of stem cell delivery and safety. The Working Group also recommended utilization of genomic and proteomic techniques to characterize the progression from a stem cell to adult cell types. A number of resource needs, including stem cell banks and animal models to establish treatment eff icacy, were also identified.  -3-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR REGENERATIVE & RE PARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Background Recent discoveries provide new and unprecedented opportunities for the therapeutic use of stem, progenitor, and differentiated cells for new treatments of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. In August 2001 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) formed the Cell-based Therapy Group in order to address stem cell and cell-based therapy issues, to track human embryonic stem cell applications and grants, and to formulate a strategic plan for the development of a research program leading to new cell-based therapies. The Cell-based Therapy Group is formulating an Institute-wide implementation plan integrating basic and translational research programs to support the development of new cellular therapies. Potential cell-based therapies could involve a variety of cell sources. Bone marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood stem cells have been used to treat serious blood disorders, malignant disease, and inherited diseases. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cells but may also differentiate into other cell lineages. For example, the capacity of bone marrow derived cells to engraft as alveolar type 1 epithelial cells and as bronchial epithelial cells has been demonstrated. Bone marrow and cord blood are also being used as a source of endothelial progenitor cells for exploratory treatments for cardiac and limb ischemia. Mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow have been demonstrated to differentiate into a variety of non-hematopoietic tissues including bone, cartilage, tendon, fat, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and early progenitors of neural cells. Interesting preliminary data suggests mesenchymal stem cells may promote hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and foster tolerance and facilitate transplantation of heart, lung, or blood tissues from unrelated donors. Adult bone marrow cells have been reported as a source of cells for repairing various tissues, including blood vessels, heart muscle, skeletal muscle and nervous tissue. A novel multipotent adult progenitor cell isolated from bone marrow is reported to differentiate into cells associated with all three germ cell layers and the potential of these cells is just beginning to be explored. Adult skeletal muscle cells are being utilized and cultured as a potential cell source for cellular cardiomyoplasty for the treatment of heart disease. In addition, it has been speculated and there is pre liminary eviden ce that cardiovasc ular and lung tissue s may conta in one o r more progenitor or stem cells that could be induced to proliferate and repair cellular damage. The National Institutes of Health is implementing a policy permitting federal funding of research using human embryonic stem cell lines from a registry of cell lines that meet the eligibility criteria. Embryon ic stem cells can d iff erentia te into ce lls associate d with all three germ cell layers and have been sho wn to form cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic cells. The best source of cells and their potential for cell-based therapy is a key research question. In order to plan for a working group for 2002, the Cell-based Therapy group convened a sixmember teleconference on October 15, 2001. The six panel members were: 1) Dr. Ray C.J. Chiu in Division at Cardiothoracic Surgery at McGill University; 2) Dr. Cynthia Dunbar in the Hematology Branch at National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; 3) Dr. Loren Field in the  -4-   Department of Medicine at Indiana University; 4) Dr. Margaret Goodell in the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine; 5) Dr. Saul Sharkis in the Experimental Hematology Program at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center; and 6) Dr. David Warburton in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. They provided perspectives for developing a program in cellular therapies that assisted the Cell-based Therapy Group in formulating a framework for a working group to be convened in 2002. The panel also provided names of scientific experts, outlined roadblocks and priorities to be addressed, and cited resources missing from current programs. Using this information, the Cell-based Therapy group outlined the agenda and convened a working group May 1-2, 2002 to define the state-of-the-art on cell-based therapies, discuss the implications of that knowledge for research and medicine, and identify opportunities and obstacles to successfully exploiting cell-based therapies for repairing or replacing damaged, diseased, or defective tissue with new, functional tissue. The meeting organizers included Mary Anne Berberich from the Division of Lung Diseases, Chris Kelley and John Fakunding from the Division of Heart and Vascular Diseases, and John Thomas from the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources. The twenty-four scientific experts listed below were scheduled to participate in the working group, however, the meeting chair, Dr. Helen Blau, and the one session chair, Dr. Anthony Atalia, were not able to attend du e to illness. The meeting was organized into four sessions: 1) Tools, Technologies and other Resources; 2) Basic Science Knowledge; 3) Clinical Applications; and 4) Master Plan: Vision, Scope and Direction. The entire agenda is included in the Appendix.                       Antho ny J. Atala Barbara E. Bierer Helen Blau Ray C. J. Chiu Ronald Crystal Francesco J. DeMayo Cynthia Du nbar Jonat han A.

Stem cells must undergo tissue-specific differentiation either prior to transpla ntatio n or in vivo and be expandable to the scale required for clinical application. Safety considerations are paramount, including a lack of tumor formation and an inability for germ line transmission. The advantages of embryonic stem cells as a cell source, include virtually indefinite growth and differentiation potential that encompasses all cells and tissues. Specific differentiation in vitro into cells with th e phen otypic cha racteristics of cardiomyocyt es, neu ral cells, insulin produc ing bet a cells, and hemato poietic ce lls has bee n demon strated . However, emb ryonic stem cells give rise to teratomas, suggesting the need for complete stem cell differentiation or the removal of any remaining undifferentiated embryonic stem cells from a graft. If human embryonic cell lines are used, they would be allogeneic to potential recipients. The generation of auto logous embryonic stem cells would require nuclear transfer techniques. An alternate cell source is somatic stem cells. These so-called ""adult"" stem cells could be derived from specific tissues including hematopoietic, mesenchymal, neuronal, and endothelial stem cells and possibly ste m cells from the heart, lun g and live r. If tissue-spe cific stem ce lls have the ability to acquire the fate of cell types different from the tissue of origin, termed ""stem cell plasticity,"" this will further expand th e utility of somatic stem cells for cellular therapy. To date mo st demon strations of ste m cell plasticity invo lve only a f raction of 1 percen t of th e cells in a tissue. For clinical application plasticity must be rigorously demonstrated to include a robust, persistent engraftment resulting in functional improvement.  Models and Functional Assessment Discussion Panel: Field, Fine, Chiu, Keating, Whitsett The development of models for functional assessment of cell-based therapies requires accurate stem cell tracking, evaluation of the stem cell differentiation, and the selection of physiologic endpoints or surrogate markers for assessing impact on function. Cell tracking or cell diff erentia tion f ate map ping ha s used ge netic markers, such as Y or X chromo some markers or enzyme polymorph isms. The inhe rent error rate of th ese tech nique s is problemat ic when the cell frequency is low. An alternate method, transgene markers, are more difficult to use clinically and this method cannot be applied to banked samples. Metabolic tags such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling can be useful for cell transplantation studies but the  -7-   results are subjective and sensitivity may be an issue if the transplanted cells proliferate. The assessment of dif ferentiation or trans-diff erentiation events can use en dogenou s phenotypic markers, but multiple markers are needed to increase reliability. Lineage restricted reporter genes can provide an unambiguous assay if designed and performed correctly, but they are more difficult to use clinically and this method cannot be applied to banked samples. In more complex systems ""nonspecific"" complications may arise, such as transgene methylation. Assessment of the physiologic consequences of the process requires consideration of the mechanism for the physiologic endpoint. A cell-based therapy could result in the development of functional new cells. Alternatively, the therapy could increase growth of a nearby tissue, increase tissue circulation, have a positive effect on connective tissue remodeling, or alter infla mmatory or immune response s. That is, the cellular thera py may result in a direct cellspecific effect or may result in an indirect effect. Therapy may improve function over time or attenuate a decreasing physiological function. The pursuit of new cell-based therapies requires d emonstra tion of long-term ef ficacy in a longitu dinal stu dy, not merely single time point measurements.  -8-   Session II: Basic Science Knowledge Lessons from Developmental Biology for Cell-based Therapy Discussion panel: Warburton, Hogan, DeMayo, Epstein, O'Reilly, Whittset The disciplines of developmental biology and stem cell biology are closely linked. Issues at the core of developmental biology research are reemerging as important subjects relevant to therapeutic interventions utilizing stem cells. Recent discoveries in organ morphogenesis and stem cell-based organ regeneration support a cautious optimism about their successful application to heart, lung and blood disease. However, useful information about the possibilities for exploitation of human genome programs governing organogenesis, and by analogy, regeneration by stem cells, is as yet rudimentary. Therefore, the successful application of cell-based therapies to disease conditions is realistically limited by insufficient basic science knowledge of fundamental processes. Studies in flies and mice have identified only a few of the key genes that determine organogenesis. More basic research is required to comprehend the full repertoire of genomic and proteomic interactions that determine organspecific form and function. Because much of the specificity is derived from temporo-spatial interaction between signals of mesodermal, endodermal or ectodermal origin, knowledge of these interactions is a necessary prerequisite to devising rational cell therapies for repair or regeneration. Central to any discussion of cell-based therapies is the need for some agreement on the def inition of a ""stem cell"" and how it dif fers f rom a ""proge nitor cell."" A stem ce ll is a relatively undifferentiated cell that has the capacity for sustained self-renewal, often throughout the lifetime of an animal, as well as the potential to give rise to differentiated progeny. A multipotent ""stem cell"" can self renew and give rise to several different mature cell types. In the lung, a multipotent stem cell might give rise to ciliated cells, clara cells, alveolar type II cells, and other cell types. Due to complexity of structure, the lung, like the heart, may lack tissuespecific stem cells. A progenitor cell usually belongs to a transitory amplifying population of cells derived from a ste m cell. It does not have th e capa city for su stained , undif fere ntiate d self renewal. Unfo rtunate ly, studies on stem cell bio logy in the lung are n owhere n ear as ad vanced as in other endoderm-derived organs such as the intestine and pancreas. However, an investment in basic ste m cell biology, along with continu ed prog ress in lung e mbryology, should a lter this disparity. A major need has been identified as a ""molecular lung anatomy project"". The goal of this project would be to describe the lineages of all the different cell types in the lung and to identify the nature and function of genes and proteins expressed in them. This could be achieved by introducing ""tags"" or ""reporters"" into specific kinds of epithelial or mesenchymal cells and following their fate in embryonic lung, in normal adult lung, and in lung undergoing reparative growth. This approach is very versatile; marked cell populations could be isolated and their gene expression profiles determined, or the effect of changes in specific genes on cell behavior could be followed in vivo. This approach would generate searchable, annotated, internet accessible databases of expressed genes that can be compared to similar databases gene rated f rom stem and progen itor cells fro m other tissu es, fo r instance , the he matopo ietic system, maintained by Dr. Ihor Lemishka at Princeton.  -9-   Preliminary proof of the principle that several possibilities for tissue regeneration exist has been obtained for cardiac regeneration, either from resident stem cells and from homing of bone marrow or body f at-derived stem cells. Howeve r, the biolo gy of both resid ent ste m cells and tissue specific stem cell homing remains obscure. Specificity of homing mechanisms for bone marrow, fat or mesenchymal stem cells to specific tissues is a high priority pursuit and should be explored. The development of suitable gene markers to be able to identify stem cells and to follow their fate in vivo would represent a major advance and would accelerate discovery in therapeutic applications. An important lesson from developmental biology relevant to this po tentia l is that the re are altern ative emb ryological o rigins of mature cardiova scular structu re. For example , recent st udies ind icate tha t there a re at least two early heart fields with cells capable of ultimately contributing to the myocardium. Likewise, both lateral plate mesoderm and neural crest cells are able to differentiate into smooth muscle, yet the respective progenitor cells are quite different. As in the lung, with its diverse assortment of cell types, it remains unclear if the intra- and extra-cellular signaling pathways that trigger terminal dif fere ntiation of th ese un related progen itors are iden tical or relate d. For stem cells derived from adult or embryonic tissue, the growth factor and signaling pathways governing the process of appropriate differentiation may not be conserved. Each cell type will need to be investigated in detail and premature extrapolation from one to the other should be avoided. Studies on the basic biology of stem cells are needed. Areas to emphasize include: 1. Develop RNA and protein expression profiles, cell-surface markers and/or monoclonal antibodies to define the stages of progression from a stem cell to a functional diff erentia ted cell. (This may lack the `hyp othes is driven' labe l becaus e of its inheren tly descriptive nature but it is a fundamental requirement for success.) 2. Provide evidence for the existence of a stem cell in the lung. Determine how many different kinds of stem cells are present, i.e., one for each type of cell present. 3. Characterize the stem cell markers. Determine how robust they are and whether they can be used to sort out the stem cells. 4. Determine whether they respond to signals and whether these signals can be manipulated to promote proliferation of stem cells after injury. 5. Determine and characterize the cytoplasmic, nuclear and genetic factors regulating stem cell phenotypes. 6. Continue studies of basic mechanisms of tissue and organ patterning and regeneration. 7. Develop small and large animal models of cell-based therapies with appropriate delivery devices and in vivo imaging capabilities. 8. The ""molecular lung anatomy project,"" using cre-lox technology for tagging presumptive stem cells and follow th eir course in lun g deve lopment in transge nic mice, is equ ally applicable to heart and would provide for sharing of these mouse stem cell models and the data base of gene function and lineage specification generated from them. Immune Aspects of Cell-based Therapy Discussion p anel: De Mayo, Matzinger, O'Re illy One of the goals of investigating the role of the immune system in cell-based therapies is to understand how the immune system regulates cell function, circulating stem cell and progenitor cell repair, an d transp lantat ion. This inclu des ho w the immune system regu lates pu lmonary epithe lial cell fun ction, ho w the pulmo nary tissue regulate s the activit y of th e immune syst em in  -10-   the lung and how circulating stem cells may contribute to pulmonary cell repair in this milieu. Critical elements that control proliferation versus differentiation choices of resident heart, lung, blood stem cells are only beginning to be understood. This information is of paramount importance in keeping stem cell therapy under control. The use of animal models where gene expressio n and a blation can be co ntrolled in a regulat ed f ashion , in combina tion with ge nomic approaches will allow the development of such therapies. Further development and characterization of animal models mirroring human disease, for example, storage diseases, could be used to define the potential therapeutic effects of stem cell therapies at different stages of development. The basic science of physiologic and immunologic barriers to stem cell transplantation must also be defined. It will be important to determine whether cell-based therapies will enjoy immune tolerance and, if not, to develop an immune-tolerant universal donor pool of stem cells. An evaluation of the immunogenicity of embryonic stem cells and adult mult i-poten tial stem cells comp ared to h ematop oietic stem ce lls, diff erentia ted cells in organ allografts, and dendritic cells could reveal whether embryonic stem cells have alternative mechanisms for inhibiting or evading alloresponsive T cells, such as those operating in the developing fetus. All this would be facilitated by establishing a gene activation registry of appropriate transgenic mouse model constructs. Development of better imaging techniques would assist in the characterization of phenotypes. Stem cell transfer likely involves definition of critical pairings of cell types essential to lineage specific stem cell differentiation. The influence of established, specialized cell niches permissive to in vivo development, organ specific differentiation and functional integration must be explored. It is critical to bear in mind that immed iate clinical tra nslation will likely be impossible o r dange rous withou t more basic knowledge of the fundamental processes involved in the immune aspects of cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine.  -11-   Session III: Clinical Applications In considering clinical applications for cell-based therapies, we need to reflect on lessons learned from the experience with gene therapy. First and foremost will be adequate characte rization of cell prepara tions tha t are to be utilized f or cell-based therapie s. It is necessary that adequate characterization of cells has taken place to be able to understand and follow the f ate of cells. In terms of control issues, there is concern that utilizing cells, particularly stem cells, may have unintended consequences, such as the development of malignancies or teratomas. In addition, with therapies utilizing cells, there is the possibility that too many cells will be introduced, that the wrong cell type will be utilized or incorporated, or that cells will either end up in the wrong place within the target tissue or organ or be distributed outside of the intended target with a possible adverse conseq uence. There may be instances, such as th ese, whe re it may not b e bene ficial to have th e cell-base d therap y continu e or there may be a need for a means of cellular control. In this instance, there may be a consideration of utilizing suicide genes or other similar strategies to halt or limit the cell-based therapy. Stem cell products have long been used and manipulated in various ways largely focused on deple ting sub sets of accompa nying immun e cells. Howeve r, the bu rgeonin g field of ste m cell biology h as posite d the ste m cell as a resou rce for reg enerat ing multiple cell types if manipulated properly ex vivo. Such manipulations involve complex culturing systems and a sophisticated understanding of the basic biology of the cells coupled to bioengineering expertise. In addition, recent advances with in vivo selection systems for genetically modified stem cells have raised the possibility of using in vivo selection to artif icially amplify g enetica lly modified cells in diseases (e.g., sickle cell disease, Cooley's anemia) where a therapeutic gene alone is expected to confer little growth or survival advantage. There is a clear need for facilities where basic investigators can transform validated hypotheses into clinical applications. Some of the preclinical tasks of a cell processing facility include the qualification and testing of reagents, scale-up of methods, high-end cell selection and culturing, development of standard operating procedures, ongoing process validation, and the provision of controlled good manufacturing practice (GMP) infrastructure. An add itional con sideratio n is the ne ed f or controlle d studie s to monito r the delive ry of cells and the use of appropriate controls. Is the effect of a cell-based therapy the result of the use of a specific stem cell or are similar results obtained using control cells that would not be expected to produce the same results. For example, in cell transplantation studies in the heart, th e injection of ske letal muscle ce lls have be en repo rted to impro ve fu nction. However, the question remains, would cardiac function also be improved using non-muscle cells such as fibroblasts or hepatocytes? Once the science has developed to the point of initiating clinical studies in cell-based therapies, there will be special concerns for patient safety and data integrity. Current regulation, policies and procedures in place for data and safety monitoring should suffice for clinical studies and trials of cell-based therapies. However, there may be a need for implementing the types of stringent controls on human subject research that apply to gene therapy protocols. Disease Candidates for Cell-Based Therapies  -12-   Discussion Panel: Drs. Dunbar, Fine, Crystal, Keating, and Quertermous The capacity of bone marrow derived cells to serve as precursors to differentiated cells of various organs has challenged long held views regarding the potential origin of somatic stem cells and the fixed nature of stem cell potential. Indeed, recent studies indicate that postnatal stem cells can give rise to tissue structures previously held to originate from only one of the different embryonic cell layers. In the mouse lung, collagen producing interstitial cells, and epithe lial cells of th e airway and alveolus h ave be en sho wn to arise f rom marrow cell precursors after bone marrow transplantation or direct systemic injection. The relevance of these observations to normal organ function and the pathogenesis of disease remains uncertain. Regardless, these observations have sug gested a therape utic strategy in which marrow cells are employed as an alternative source of progenitor cells for the replacement of specific cell types damaged or lost during the course of disease. The relative ease of obtaining and purifying marrow cells makes this an attractive option. Clinically, cell-based therapies may consist of cell transplantation strategies, cell mobilization and regeneration, or tissue engineering for replacement tissues and organs. In terms of therapeutic candidate s for cell-based therapies, there are a number of possibilities. These include new bone marrow reconstitution strategies and possible nuclear transfer for autologous stem cell gene therapies for blood diseases such as sickle cell disease and hemoglobinopath ies. In addition, cell-based therapies could be employed to establish hematopoietic chimerism to induce transplant tolerance. In terms of cardiovascular disease, cell-based therapies offer the potential to correct myocardial sinus and pacemaker dysfunction, and potentially to treat rhythm disturbances. Cell-based therapies could be utilized to treat conge stive hea rt failure , either th rough in creases in th e fu nctiona l capacity o f the heart muscles or through replacement or repair of damaged or defective tissue. Cell-based therapy could be utilized to re pair the h eart soo n af ter a hea rt attack, a s a preven tive measu re to limit cardiac problems, such as the development of heart failure. Cell therapy for vascular bed could prevent heart attacks by targeting an d repairing atherosclerotic vessels or be used as a means of stimulating new blood vessel formation and blood flow to the ischemic heart through the stimulation of angiog enesis. The uniq ue prop erties of the lung provide inh erent ob stacles, b ut also op portun ities fo r a cellbased therapy strategy for diseases of this organ. One major obstacle is the slow turnover of lung cells. As a result, lung engraftment may require prior treatments to create ""space"" for exoge nously a dministered cells. It is notable that th e growing lung ha s height ened cell turnover, and thus, may be a more amenable therapeutic target than its adult counterpart. Another limitation is conceptual: a more complete understanding of the factors and cues that control lun g cell dif fere ntiation would provid e addit ional too ls for a ce ll-based th erapeu tic strategy. The multitude of cell types that comprise the intact lung contribute to the complexity of this issue. Defining marrow cell subtypes that have the capacity to differentiate into particular lung cell lineages is another key issue. The app ropriate h oming an d insertion of ex ogen ously de livered precu rsor cells to spe cific parenchyma sites require migration through vessel walls, basement membranes, and the extracellular space. Organ injury may improve engraftment efficiency, in part, by breaching the integrity of anatomical barriers, and by causing release of local inflammatory chemoattractant  -13-   substances. Hence, migration of marrow cells into an acutely injured heart or lung will likely be facilitated. Indeed, distal injury to lung or heart appears to significantly enhance homing, engraftment and differentiation of marrow cells into alveolar T1 or myocardial cells in mice. The unique anatomical configuration of the lung, however, suggests the possibility of direct airway delivery in con ditions th at are no t associat ed with sign ifican t infla mmation or alt eration s in barrier function. Moreover, the lung has a very extensive capillary network and receives the entire card iac outp ut. Thus, the ove rall delivery of cells to the lung may no t be limiting. Ra ther, targeting and migration into specific micro-anatomical compartments is likely to be a formidable limitation. These init ial observa tions, de rived fro m highly rarif ied systems, are intriguin g but will requ ire novel approaches to ascertain the ir true physiological significance. As a treatment strategy, cell-based therapy holds gre at promise f or reconst ituting d amage d tissue. Further, this approach may provide an alternative strategy for gene delivery. However, progress to this end will depend on: 1) the identification of cell types that require replacement in specific disease states; 2) a clearer understanding of the engraftment process; 3) and the identification of fact ors and co ndition s that au gment a nd con trol engra ftmen t. Ultimately, the eff icacy of cellbased therapies for lung and cardiac diseases will need to based on improved physiological function. Significantly more information regarding the fundamental biology of stem cells is required before rational therapies can be implemented. In this regard, early years of support may be directed at specified topics, including ""stem cell niche"" biology and better identification of precursor cell types that have trans-differentiation potential. Further, the development of certain key technologies would propel the field forward. A focus on new non-invasive methods of tracking cells into organs would be particularly useful. Once it becomes clear whether autolo gous o f allog eneic so urces of precursor cells a re adeq uate a nd nec essary f or cell therapies, a better understanding of transplantation immunology as it applies to stem cells may be required. It seems most reasonable that only after the biology of stem cells is better characterized that true translational research be supported. Moving forward with clinical protocols too early may in fact set the field back, as has occurred in the area of gene therapy. Regardless, there was a sense that certain target diseases should be identified. Severe congestive heart failure and end-stage emphysema were both th ought to be reason able starting points. Cell-based Approaches to Drug Development, Testing, Delivery Discussion Panel: Field, Fine, Chiu, Keating, and Whitsett The routine availability of human cell types and tissues would have a dramatic impact on the drug discovery process. To date, most human primary cell types are available in only restricted quantities from biopsy, donation, or autopsy tissues, and have limited functional and life span in culture. In more limited supp ly are a variety o f primary cell typ es from in dividuals with welldefined disease susceptibilities or genetic backgrounds. This paucity of human cells and tissue samples complicates the discovery of drugs to treat human disease and restricts thorough preclinical efficacy and safety profiling.  -14-   For the drug discovery process today, either biochemical or cell-based assays are used to screen f or lead dru g cand idates. In most cases, th e cells used during scree ning are immortalized cell lines that in some instances have been engineered to express a target molecule or reporter system. These cells are plated in multi-well formats and used to screen a few co mpoun ds to f ull libraries of chemical en tities. Fresh t issue or primary ce lls are gene rally only used in confirmatory studies when and if it is available. For drug metabolism and toxicity testing, candidate drugs are usually tested on immortalized cell lines representing gut epithelium, renal tubular epithelium, liver and other tissues representing target and non-target organs. In many of these cell lines, especially ""hepatocyte"" cell lines, many of the phenotypic and metabolic activities observed in the primary adult tissue are not ma intaine d in tissue cu lture limiting th e true pre dictive valu e of these te sts. As a resu lt it is often difficult to get an accurate early indication of the potential toxicity of a lead compound without elaborate animal and even human clinical studies. A renewa ble source of ce lls represent ing norma l and dise ased tissu e compon ents wou ld greatly facilitate target validation, drug screening, and drug metabolism and toxicity testing of drug can didate s. Diff erentia ting stem ce ll popula tions, es pecially plu ripoten t human embryonic stem cells, could fulfill this need. Embryonic cells have been derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst and will divide essentially indefinitely in vitro. Under appropriate cues, these cells will differentiate into representatives of all three germ lineages of the embryo, namely the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. To date, researchers have demonstrated the differentiation of neurons, cardiomyocytes, endothelial, hematopoietic, hepatocyte-like, and insulin-producing cells from human embryonic stem cells. Efforts are now underway in an increasing number of laboratories to define conditions which will direct differentiation to particular lineages and to use these derivatives to model and construct complex tissues. Differentiated cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, whether as purified or mixed populations of cells, should facilitate the functionalization and validation of drug targets along with the identification of candidate drugs. For instance, development of mixtures of neural components from stem cell populations could facilitate study of synapse formation, function, and degen eration, and lead to discovery of n ew molecules to treat neurodegene rative diseases. Combinations of neural and muscle cells could be used to investigate processes active at neuromuscular junctions with the consequent development of new therapeutics for movemen t disorders a nd disea ses. The ro utine a vailability of cardiomyocyt es could permit direct screening for drugs that will maintain or improve cardiac muscle contractility and prevent apoptosis or remodeling after ischemic episodes. Development of stem cell lines containing gene tic predispo sitions to d isease co uld be u sed to d erive targe t cells that co uld be u sed in basic research and in screening activities. Human embryonic stem cell derivatives could also facilitate the introduction of drug metabolism and toxicity testing earlier in the drug discovery process. Use of such cells could allow the earlier detection of potentially ineffective or toxic drug candidates before even animal or human testing. The establishment of embryonic cell lines representing multiple haplotypes which could subsequently be differentiated for hepatocytes, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and other cell types for drug metabolism and toxicity testing could facilitate the determination of the potential benefits and safety issues amongst different patient populations. The continuous  -15-   availability of such human cells would facilitate creation of information databases on the performance and safety of compounds, providing a reference standard for comparison for new drug candidates. In all of th e abov e applica tions, th e stem cell-de rived dif fere ntiate d cells could be used directly in the same assays tha t are used routinely to day in the drug disco very process . This techn ology wou ld compleme nt othe r techno logies th at are alrea dy availab le or are in development to monitor gene a nd protein changes in cells. The succe ssfu l isolation o f hu man stem ce lls from adu lt, fet al and e mbryonic sou rces of fers the promise for developing an array of novel therapeutics. Biologic therapies comprised of stem cells are expected to be effective in treating a wide variety of medical conditions through tissue reg enerat ion and repair as well as th e target ed delive ry of ge netic mate rial. Stem cellbased therapie s represen t a complex b iological e ntity. Followin g transp lantat ion, stem ce lls interact intimately with, and are influenced by the physiology of the recipient. Prior to patient administration cultured human stem cells are maintained under conditions that promote either the self-renewing expansion of undifferentiated progenitors or the acquisition of differentiated properties that are indicative of the phenotype the cells will assume. Once transplanted, incompletely differentiated populations of stem cells are impacted by additional fine-tuning that occurs as a consequence of instructions received from the microenvironment of the surrounding milieu encountered within the recipient. The intrinsic capacities for self-renewal and differentiation point simultaneously to the perceived therapeutic potential for stem cells, as well as, the challenge of assessing their safety from a regulatory perspective. Regardless of the sou rce of d erivation , assessin g human stem cell saf ety throu gh clinical inve stigation will require implementation of a comprehensive strategy. Each checkpoint in the process of developing a therapeutic product comprised of human stem cells beginning with identification and evaluation of suitable sources will require careful scrutiny. Included in a global assessmen t are the derivation , expan sion, man ipulation , and ch aracteriza tion hu man stem ce ll lines, as well as preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing in appropriate animal models. Being able to trace back from the cellular preparation for transplantation to the source of the founder stem cell population is critical as this allows each safety checkpoint to be connected, one to the oth er. Assessme nt and analysis of stem cell saf ety in the clinical setting will be vitally important to the development of eff icacious stem cell therapies.  -16-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR REGENERATIVE & RE PARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Recommendations The Working Groups' recommendations have been designated into three general categories depending upon whether implementation might occur on level of an individual NHLBI Division (Division Interest), or the entire Institute (NHLBI Interest), or involve multiple Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-wide Interest). In addition, it is noted whether the recommendation is for a new program, the continued support of an ongoing program, or for both. The items are liste d in priority orde r. 1. Basic research on stem cell biology (NIH-wide Interest). The recommendation is for a strong, continued emphasis o n the su pport of basic stem cell research as the basis for future preclinical and clinical advances for new cell-based therapies. Stem cell niche (NHLBI Interest). The W orking Group recommends new projects on the influence of the stem cell niche or environment on the differentiation of the cells. It is felt tools are available to structurally and fun ctionally d efin e the ste m cell niche inclu ding ste m cell-stromal cell interactions. Cellular and tissue rege nera tion (NHLBI Intere st). The Working Group recommended new studies of natural cellular or tissue mechanisms for the regeneration of cells, tissues and organs involving resident stem, precursor, and diffe rentiated cell types. Immune response (NHLBI Intere st). New research needs to be initiated on the immunoge nic pote ntial of stem and precursor cells a re recommend ed. This will address the question of tolerance or the development of histocompatibility for engrafte d allogeneic cells. Non-invasive new imaging techniques (NIH-wide Interest). The Working Group unanimously indicated new and improved methods are needed to track cell fat e in vivo f or animal stu dies and for clinical res earch. The Group f elt advances in these techniques would greatly accelerate the pace of research. Advancement of new lung cell-based therapies (Division Interest). The Working Group identified pulmonary stem and progenitor cell research as key areas in need of development. The following new areas were recommended by the Group to as key focus areas to accomplish this goal: (1) Studies to identif ying curren tly unide ntifie d lung ste m cells; (2) Research on the facto rs that control growth and development of lung and lung vasculature; (3) Development of lung cell clonogenic assays; (4) Tools for lung functional genomics such as gene inactivation techno logy; (5) a lung genome project modeled afte r the hematopoietic stem cell database; (6) a lung resource project to generate cDNA libraries from embryonic and adult lung cells; and (7) preclinical an imal models an d translat ional stu dies inves tigating stem cell repair of lung injury. Cardiomyogenic potential of stem cells (Division Interest). This new area was of interest to the W orking Group due to its clear clinical relevance. To  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  -17-   8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  13.  14.  accelerate this area, the Group recommended preclinical research in three key areas: (1) assess of the cardiomyogenic differentiation potential of various stem cell sources; (2) determina tion of the exte nt and basis of physiolog ic improvement as the result of the cellular therapy; and (3) determination of the mechanism of improvement and heart repair whether due to the incorporation of cardiomyocytes or due to alternate mechanisms. Tissue engineering and bioengineering (NHLBI Interest). The Group thought these programs were playing a key role in the development of cell-based therapies and recommended continued support of the Bioe ngineering Research Partnerships and Tissue Engineering grants. Training programs (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended sponsorship of both new training programs and the continuation of on going training p rograms to build interdisciplinary communities of investigators who study stem cells and cell-based therapies. Stem cell meetings and workshops (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended both new stem cell workshops and the continuation of regular stem cell meet ings spo nsored by NHLBI to f oster the exchan ge of scientif ic info rmation an d to bu ilding inte rdisciplinary commu nities of stem cell investigators. As the field develops, the group recommended the NHLBI sponsor the formation of workshops to address a specific preclinical or clinical issue for the purpose of developing a consensu s report on the topic. Embryonic stem cells (NHLBI Interest). The Working Group thought the new area of human embryonic stem cell lines off ers unique therapeutic oppo rtunities, a novel avenue for developmental biology studies, and new opportunities for preclinical testing and pharmaceutical development. The Group recommended six research areas be pursued to promote this new area: (1) the development of so matic cell nucle ar recond itioning f or the ge neratio n of non-immuno genic cells fo r use in transp lantat ion; (2) the establish ment of protoco ls for large -scale cell differentiation and isolation of cells for therapeutic use; (3) the development of gene transfer protocols for use with embryonic stem cells; (4) the develo pment o f tran splanta tion meth ods to remo ve und iff erentia ted emb ryonic stem cells f rom cellular prod ucts; (5) the develop ment of cell delivery syste ms for clinical use; and (6) preclinical translational studies to study the use of embryonic cells as cell-based therapies. Embryonic stem cell data workshop (NIH-wide Interest). The Group recommended a new workshop be held to standardize embryonic stem cell data collection and comparisons, thus enabling the direct comparison of data among stem cell laboratories. The Group felt this should include the standardization of cell reference standards and reference techniques, such as the choice of the microarray. Centers (NHLBI Interest). The Working Group recommended new or continuation of ce nters, con sortiums, or Sp ecialized Ce nters of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCORs) to encourage collaborative teams with multi-disciplinary basic and clinical investigators. Some members of the Group thought Cente rs were the best approach to achieve new regene rative therapies. Clinical studies (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended new clinical studies in four areas: (1) stem cell delivery; (2) integration of cells into the target  -18-   15.  16.  tissues; (3) clinical outcome of the therapy; and (4) safety of cell-based therapy. The Group thought clinical trials should not be undertaken prematurely, but at the appropriate time important initial clinical disease targets include these f ive areas: (1) heart failure due to myocardial infarction; (2) heart failure due to cardiomyopathies; (3) severe congestive heart failure; (4) end stage emphysema; and (5) obstructive vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. From stem cell to somatic cell (NHLBI Interest). Using genomics and proteomics for characterization of RNA and protein expression profiles, the Working Group recommended new studies to define the progression from stem cell to adult cell type, such as mature cardiac myocyte, smooth muscle, endo thelial cell, p neumo cyte, an d blood cells. The Grou p fe lt basic developmental studies were a key to accelerating new therapies. Resource needs (NHLBI Interest). The Group identified the following seven new research resources needed to remove potential roadblocks in the field: (1) stem cell banks to increase the availability of cells to all investigators; (2) bioinformatics and informatics network to promote sharing stem cell data, e.g., microarray ana lysis data; (3) central reso urces f or major equ ipment, e .g., cell sorters an d conf ocal microscop es, not available at individu al laborat ories; (4) a registry of transge nic mice fo r use in stem ce ll research stu dies; (5) core facilities for functional genomics and proteomics to increase the availability of these tools; (6) a ste m cell website pro viding inf ormation f or both in vestigat ors and patient groups; (7) availability of good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade mediators and factors needed for culture of stem cells in vitro; and (8) the develo pment o f an imal models to establish eff icacy and assess ph ysiologic utility for repair, to develop delivery devices and imaging capabilities, and to develop models to mirror human diseases.  -19-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR RE GE NER ATIV E & REPARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Po ok s Hill Ma rr iott, B ethe sda , MD May 1-2, 2002 May 1 7:45 AM 8:15 8:30 Coff ee/Continental Breakf ast Welcome and Charge to group: Dr. Al ving , De pu ty Dir ect or, NHLB I Current state of the science Session 1 9:00 9:15 10:30 10:40 10:55 12:00 Tools, Technologies and other Resources Dr. Blau Dr. Sharkis Dr. Verfa illie  Sources of Cells for Cell-based Therapies Discussion Panel: Drs.
