GX035-31-15769904	EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS                                   Recent earthquakes on and near the Island of Hawaii,  1962-1985.          The Island of Hawaii experiences thousands of earthquakes each year; most are so small that they can only be detected by instruments, but some are strong enough to be felt, and a few cause minor-to-moderate damage. Most of Hawaii's earthquakes are directly related to volcanic activity and are caused by magma moving beneath the earth's surface. Earthquakes may occur before or during an eruption, or they may result from the underground movement of magma that comes close to the surface but does not erupt. A few of the island's earthquakes are less directly related to volcanism; these earthquakes originate in zones of structural weakness at the base of the volcanoes or deep within the earth beneath the island.    Strong earthquakes endanger people and property by shaking structures and by causing ground cracks, ground settling, and landslides. Strong earthquakes in Hawaii's past have destroyed buildings, water tanks, and bridges, and have disrupted water, sewer, and utility lines. Locally, such damage can be intensified where soft, water-saturated soils amplify earthquake ground motions. On steep slopes, such soils may fail during an earthquake, resulting in mudflows or landslides. An indirect hazard produced by some earthquakes is a tsunami, a large sea wave that can be far more damaging than any of the direct seismic hazards.    The size of an earthquake is commonly expressed by its magnitude on the Richter scale, which is a measure of the relative size of the earthquake wave recorded on seismographs. An increase of one whole number on the Richter scale  represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the seismograph recording. Earthquakes greater than about magnitude 3 usually can be felt by people near the source area, those greater than magnitude 5 are potentially damaging, and any earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater that occurs near populated areas is certain to cause widespread property damage.    The earthquakes directly associated with the movement of magma are concentrated beneath the island's active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa. Very shallow earthquakes frequently precede or accompany an eruption. Hundreds of such earthquakes make up swarms that commonly occur over a period of several hours or days before an eruption as magma forces its way into a new area. These earthquakes are seldom large enough to cause widespread damage, but they may produce extensive ground fracturing close to the potential eruption site. Once an eruption begins, the earthquakes usually diminish.    Other earthquakes beneath the active volcanoes are generated by the pressures exerted by magma that never reaches the surface. Kilauea's east rift zone is continually being wedged apart by the injection of new magma, much of which is stored underground deep within the rift zone. Since the north flank of Kilauea is immobilized by the adjacent mass of Mauna Loa, the south flank, which faces the ocean, must move outward to make room for the additional magma. Periodically, Kilauea's south flank abruptly shifts seaward in response to this pressure, causing earthquakes. Most such earthquakes are small, but a few are large and can cause damage.                              Generalized locations of damaging earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater since 1868 on the Island of Hawaii. The same earthquakes are listed in the accompanying table. The magnitudes marked by an (*) are based on eyewitness accounts of the earthquakes' effects and on reports of damage. Since about 1950, the accuracy of location, magnitude, and depth determinations has continually improved as the capability of seismic instruments has increased.                   Year     Date     Region     Magnitude     Depth (Mi)      1868    Mar. 28    Mauna Loa south flank     6.5-7.0*      No data      1868    Apr. 2   Mauna Loa south flank     7.5-8.1*     No data      1929    Oct. 5   Hualalai   6.5*       No data      1941    Sept. 25   Kaoiki    6.0*     No data      1950    May 29    Mauna Loa southwest rift     6.2     No data      1951    Apr. 22     Kilauea    6.3    20      1951    Aug. 21    Kona    6.9    5      1952    May 23    Kona    6.0        5      1954    Mar. 30    Kilauea south flank     6.5    5      1962    June 27   Kaoiki    6.1      6      1973    Apr. 26    Honomu    6.2    25      1975    Nov. 29    Kilauea south flank     7.2     6      1983    Nov. 16    Kaoiki    6.6     7      1989    June 25   Kilauea south flank     6.1    9              In 1975, Kilauea's south flank was the site of the magnitude 7.2 Kalapana earthquake, the highest magnitude event in this century. The Kalapana coast subsided as much as 11 feet, generating a huge tsunami that claimed two lives in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, destroyed houses in Punaluu, sank fishing boats in Keauhou Bay, and damaged boats and piers in Hilo. The most recent large earthquake on Kilauea's south flank occurred in June 1989. With a magnitude of 6.1, this quake caused much less damage than the 1975 event.

The Kealakekua fault zone on Hawaii's Kona coast was the site of an earthquake of about magnitude 6.9 in 1951 that may have been related to the 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa's southwest rift zone. The largest Hawaiian earthquake in recorded history occurred in 1868 beneath the Ka'u district on the southeast flank of Mauna Loa; it had an estimated magnitude of between 7.5 and 8.1. The 1868 earthquake caused damage across the entire island and was felt as far away as the Island of Kauai. The devastation was greatest in the Ka'u district, where an earthquake-triggered mudflow killed 31 people and coastal subsidence produced a tsunami that destroyed several villages. At least 79 people perished during this earthquake; most of these casualties resulted from the landslide and tsunami.   Earthquakes in the Kaoiki region, centered between Kilauea and Mauna Loa, are also thought to be related to stresses in the earth's crust that are produced by the activity of the two volcanoes. In the last half century, earthquakes with magnitudes from 5.5 to 6.6 have shaken the Kaoiki region about once every 10 years. The latest large earthquake in this area had a magnitude of 6.6 and occurred in 1983. This event caused substantial damage to structures in Ka'u, Puna, and North and South Hilo districts. Ground cracking and settling led to temporary road closures, and landslides occurred on steep slopes. The financial losses caused by the earthquake were estimated at $7 million. Fortunately, there were only minor injuries because the earthquake struck early in the morning when most people were still in bed.    Large earthquakes unrelated to volcanic activity also occur at irregular intervals on the Island of Hawaii. In 1973, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake located 25 miles beneath Honomu, north of Hilo, injured 11 people and caused $5.6 million worth of damage. Such earthquakes have no known recurrence interval and are difficult to predict.                      Hilo building damaged by the November 1983 Kaoiki earthquake.  (Photograph by J.M. Buchanan-Banks, USGS)           Defining hazard zones for the effects of earthquakes is more difficult than for eruptions and has not been attempted for the Island of Hawaii. For the most part, earthquakes on Hawaii are concentrated beneath Kilauea and Mauna Loa, particularly beneath the south flanks of both volcanoes, and in the Kaoiki region between them. The likelihood of a damaging earthquake on Kilauea or Mauna Loa probably increases with long-lived activity of the rift zones, but its precise time and magnitude are impossible to predict.    Small, non-damaging earthquakes will be felt more frequently by people living on the slopes of these volcanoes. The effects of a large earthquake under Kilauea or Mauna Loa, however, will not be limited to the immediate area and may cause damage over much of the island. Similarly, deep earthquakes, such as the 1973 Honomu earthquake, can take place under any part of the island and can produce damaging effects over a wide area.    One problem in assigning seismic hazard zones to the island is that the ground shaking during a strong earthquake may vary within a small area. This variation is because the effects of earthquakes are closely related to the nature of the underlying ground; for example, whether it is mainly lava bedrock or soil. Two homes in the same neighborhood may suffer different degrees of damage depending on the properties of the ground upon which they are built. In addition, local topography strongly affects earthquake hazards. Steep slopes composed of loose material may produce large landslides during an earthquake.    The risk from living in a seismically active area, unlike that of living in an area prone to being covered by lava, also depends to a large degree on the type of construction used in a given home. Earthquake shaking may damage certain types of houses, while leaving other types of construction unscathed. For all of these reasons, earthquake hazards are highly localized, and it is difficult to define broad zones with the same relative degree of hazard.

In 1997, there were 117 Flood/Flash Flood related fatalities, 14 less than 1996 and 7 more than the annual national average. Some notable flood/flash flood events: May 31, 1889  The Johnstown Flood claimed 2,209 lives when the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River was breached. Heavy rainfall contributed to the erosion of the earthen dam wall, which was 75 feet high and 900 feet long. Eventual failure of the dam occurred resulting in a wall of water (35-40 feet) to move through Johnstown. The lake was over 2 miles long, 1 mile wide and up to 100 feet deep. The flood resulted in 1600 homes lost, 280 businesses destroyed, and an estimated $17 million in property damage. In August 1969  114 fatalities occurred in Western Virginia during floods associated with Hurricane Camille. On June 9-10, 1972  237 fatalities occurred in Eastern South Dakota during flash floods. On August 1, 1976  Thunderstorms in the Rocky Mountains near Estes Park, Colorado, sent a 19-foot wall of water down the Big Thompson Canyon, killing 140 people. September 12, 1977  16 inches of rain fell in the Kansas City metropolitan area, causing a flash flood that killed 25 people and caused an estimated $90 Million dollars property damage. On June 14, 1990  In Shadyside, Ohio, 4 inches of rain fell in less than 2 hours resulting in a flash flood that caused 26 fatalities. December 1991  January 1992 - Up to 17 inches of rain fell in South-central Texas causing wide-spread river flooding on the Guadalupe, Brazos, Trinity, and Colorado Rivers accounting for 15 fatalities. Summer 1993  Persistent rains in the Mississippi River Valley caused major flooding of the Mississippi River and many of its tributaries. The floods resulted in 52 fatalities and an estimated $20 billion in damage. Nearly 50,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and more than 15 million acres of farmland were affected July 1994  Tropical Storm Alberto's torrential rainfall caused floods in central Georgia killing 32. January - March of 1995  Much of California experienced periods of heavy precipitation, causing floods which resulted in over $3 billion in damages and 27 fatalities. January 18-19, 1996  Large amounts of rain coupled with a rapidly melting snowpack resulted in flash floods that caused 30 deaths in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US. March 1-7, 1997  Flooding of the Ohio River resulted in 33 deaths in the Ohio Valley.   57 Year List of Flood/Flash Flood Fatalities 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 60 47 68 107 33 91 28 55 62 48 93 51 54 40 55 302 42 82 47 25 169 93 53 41 142 188 56 53 57 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 445 131 68 555 178 111 127 193 210 125 121 82 84 155 204 126 166 94 70 31 85 142 61 62 103 91 80 131 117 1997 fatalities by locations: 39% 38% 4% 6% 2% 8% 3% vehicle in or near a waterway permanent home mobile home boats or boating unknown/other camping  1997 fatalities by state: TX AZ KY CO CA MO OH WV TN NC NV PA 20 20 16 9 8 5 5 5 4 3 3 3 FL ND NM OK AR IA IL IN LA PR UT WA Total 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 117   National Summary of Lightning, 1997 Stuart Hinson and William Angel National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Environmental, Satellite, Data and Information Service National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC  There were 42 deaths contributed to lightning in 1997, 10 less than 1996, which is 53% below the annual national average of 90. A 46% increase of deaths in open areas such as parks and fields was reported while there was a 76% decrease in various/other unknown locations. This is most likely due to the increased accuracy in the definition of death/injury locations. There were 306 injuries reported in 1997, 10% above the annual average of 280. In 1997, Florida ranked number 1 in both lightning deaths with 8 (19%) and injuries with 55 (17.9%).

GX012-10-0664150	Introduction     It is a pleasure to address an audience that has had so much to do with the broad successes of GPS, not only in the field of earthquake research that I will discuss today, but across the whole range of military and civil applications of GPS.  I will concentrate on describing to you the interesting new applications within my field.    I would like to share with you some of the excitement among earth scientists about how GPS allows precise measurements of ground deformation. GPS allows us to measure the motions of earth's tectonic plates, and motions across fault systems. Moreover, we are now beginning to make GPS receivers an integral part of our network of instruments that record continuously, and monitor earthquake activity across the southern California region.    Beginning in 1990, a group of researchers mainly within the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC); including my colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Lab and at UCSD (Scripps), began trying to obtain funds from a variety of sources to start up an array of continuously recording GPS stations in southern California. I recall a special session at the American Geophysical Union less than 5 years ago today, at which several of us indicated a strong feeling that more continuous GPS stations would be the best way to vastly improve measurements of crustal deformation - at that time, it was considered preposterous to deploy even as many as 100 continuously operating GPS receivers in southern California.  We also recall one proposal after another being turned down, but we stuck with it. In retrospect, the receivers that were available in those days were not quite highly enough evolved to reliably provide good data, and there were still some problems with automating our analysis and management of the data. Through these early efforts, however, the network began to emerge.    On January 17, 1994, at 4:31 am, the Northridge earthquake did its part to remind southern Californians of the earthquake hazards we all live with, and to speed the development of our GPS monitoring system.  Since that earthquake, we have been successful in raising funds to implement a network of 250 GPS receivers across southern California. Although we are still only past the halfway mark in raising sufficient funds for this new experiment, the project of upgrading our existing 50 stations, and of installing the next 200 stations, is at hand. These stations will be deployed at the same time that the seismic monitoring network is also being upgraded with digital sensors and improved telemetry.    Across the Pacific in Japan, an even more ambitious deployment of GPS and seismic equipment is being undertaken, partly in response to the Kobe earthquake of January 17, 1995. Depending on the relative successes of these instrumental initiatives over the next several years, it seems likely that GPS will become as important to earthquake monitoring and research as seismographic instruments have been during the past century. We hope and expect to learn new things about the earth from the new GPS array, in the same way one might hope to learn something new about the universe when turning the latest new telescope skyward. And, when the next earthquake disaster strikes southern California, this new array will provide the information that emergency responders need in order to make well informed decisions.    I will describe;     the main uses of GPS in earthquake research today,     the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN), and     application of GPS to monitoring engineered structures.

The INEEL seismic network began in 1971 with a single station and evolved into a three-station network by October of 1972 for the purpose of developing a historical earthquake database. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s additional seismic stations were installed to improve earthquake monitoring of earthquake sources that may affect INEEL facilities. These sources include the volcanic rift zones within the eastern Snake River Plain, range-bounding faults along the southern portions of the Lost River Range, Lemhi Range, and Beaverhead Mountains, and background seismicity in the Intermountain Seismic Belt. Currently, the INEEL operates 27 seismic stations located throughout southeastern Idaho.   The INEEL accelerograph network began in 1973 when 11 strong-motion accelerographs were installed in buildings at the INEEL Site. Additional strong motion accelerographs were installed at the INEEL Site following the 1983 M 7.3 Borah Peak, Idaho earthquake and at seismic stations in 2002. At the INEEL Site, the strong-motion accelerographs are located within buildings at basement, floor and rooftop levels and outside of buildings at ground surface level (referred to as free-field sites).  The strong-motion accelerograph locations at the INEEL Site have been selected to provide information on the building, ground surface, and soil-building responses to strong ground motions of future large earthquakes. At seismic stations, three-component accelerometers were installed to record near-field acceleration data from small to large magnitude normal faulting earthquakes. The INEEL currently operates 31 strong-motion accelerographs.         INEEL seismic stations (red triangles) are located near potential sources of earthquakes such as range bounding faults and volcanic rift zones. Accelerometers (inverted red triangles) and continuous GPS receivers (yellow solid circles) are co-located at some INEEL seismic stations.        INEEL Seismic Station Instrumentation                A view to the southeast of seismic station Italian Canyon located along the Beaverhead fault.        The INEEL short-period seismic stations are composed of one or three seismometers. A single-component station has a vertically oriented seismometer that is either a Teledyne Geotech model S-13 or S-13 borehole Jr. Eleven stations within the eastern Snake River Plain have vertical seismometers located in 20-m (or 65 ft) deep boreholes. The remaining stations have vertical seismometers buried within 3 m (or 10 ft) of the ground surface near rock outcrops or set upon concrete pads affixed to rock outcrops. Five seismic stations have three-components, one vertically oriented sensor as described previously and two horizontally oriented Teledyne Geotech model S-13 seismometers located within concrete vaults. Additionally, six seismic stations have Applied MEMs Inc. model SF1500A tri-axial accelerometers (described below) and two have UNAVCO continuous recording GPS (Global Positioning System) (see  crustal deformation ) receivers collocated at them.   The seismic stations have DAQSystems NetDAS recording units with an embedded LINUX computer, a GPS clock and Symmetric Research 24 bit digitizer.    The NetDAS time stamps the seismic data with accuracies greater than 0.001 seconds. The seismic data are transmitted to the INEEL Research Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho using the FreeWave Technologies DGR115 900 MHz Wireless Modem. The wireless modem uses standard IP (Internet Protocol) networking features included in the embedded LINUX. INEEL uses both the 4 and 8 channel NetDAS recorders that boot from flash memory providing high reliability and low power consumption. NetDAS employs a highly efficient Generic Recording Format (GRF) that is interfaced with the U.S. Geological Surveys EARTHWORM data acquisition software. At the INEEL Research Center located in Idaho Falls, seismologists analyze the earthquake data using the SEISAN program.   INEEL Strong Motion Accelerographs                 Strong motion accelerograph located at the INEEL Research Center in Idaho Falls.      The 25 strong motion accelerographs at the INEEL Site consist of DAQSystems NetDAS four-channel recorders that contain Applied MEMs Inc. model SF1500A tri-axial accelerometers. The accelerographs are set to trigger at approximately 0.005 g. At some facility areas, several strong motion accelerographs are interconnected so that when one accelerograph is triggered, they all turn on to record earthquake data. Several strong motion accelerographs are also connected to phone lines providing quick access to acceleration data in the event of a large earthquake. The remaining accelerographs save the data on memory cards for INEEL personnel to retrieve. Acceleration data are analyzed using the SEISAN program that can produce both corrected and uncorrected acceleration, velocity and displacement time histories and amplitude spectra.   Earthquake Data Sharing     INEEL exchanges data in real-time with several nearby seismic networks using the U.S. Geological Surveys EARTHWORM program. INEEL records earthquake data from seismic stations owned and operated by BYU-Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho, Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology in Butte, Montana, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado. INEEL also provides data from some its seismic stations to these seismic networks. Real-time data exchange with surrounding networks helps to fill in gaps between seismic networks and assists with determining more precise locations of earthquakes.

Clicking on a station code will take you to a plot of the north, east and up components  of the station as a function of time.    The station velocities are in an itrf97-NA-fixed reference frame. The reference frame is described more fully under the Summary Info button on each station page. See  gp processing . for more information about the processing. Please read disclaimer below.      Disclaimer:       Be advised that these results are preliminary.  The station positions are unchecked and should not be used for any engineering applications. There may be errors in the antenna heights.  The velocities are very dependent on the length of the span of observations.

GX061-01-2741202	Hazard Mapping     Table of Contents     Geologic Hazards              USGS Response to an Urban Earthquake -- Northridge '94       Communicating and Applying What We Have Learned   C ommunicating the scientific findings of the USGS and applying those findings to meaningful seismic-hazards reduction are multifaceted and long-term efforts. Com-municating the results ranges, for example, from providing raw data to researchers via the Internet to distributing highly interpreted seismic concepts to the general public. Applying the lessons learned from the earthquake ranges from changing laws and building codes to initiating long-term research and instrumentation programs in anticipation of future events. Some of these activities can be systematically planned and executed; others are highly experimental and must rely on ad hoc decisions and windows of opportunity for successful implementation. The USGS, however, has anticipated many communication and application needs of society, and has practiced and established its role in this regard since the inception of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) in 1977. The evolution of this role to date is partly encapsulated in this section through several examples of current communication and application techniques used by the USGS.     This Report   T his report is part of a multimedia approach for reporting USGS findings on the Northridge earthquake. The USGS processed in parallel (1) this printed document, (2) a replication of this document in electronic format, and (3) a hyperlinked Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tour of USGS and related findings beginning at the Northridge Earthquake Home Page on the World Wide Web (WWW) (see p. 8). This multiphased, interconnected approach serves many functions which allow for a variety of views and levels of detail for readers with widely disparate interests and levels of scientific understanding.   The electronic copy of this report is contained in several Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files. These files contain all text and illustrations seen in the printed report, and may be downloaded and printed using commonly accessible Internet protocols as well as viewed using Adobe Acrobat reader software. The PDF files are readily accessible through links from the Northridge Earthquake Home Page on the WWW.   The HTML tour of the Northridge earthquake investigations and findings is based on the outline of the printed report, yet the tour is not a linear process. An investigator may immediately link into any chapter or topical area from the Northridge Earthquake Home Page. The HTML tour also provides links to scientific documents such as articles for scientific journals, reference lists, fact sheets, and other materials that formed the basis for this project. Additionally, the HTML tour provides many links to earthquake-related topics beyond the scope of the Northridge earthquake project. The HTML tour is a “living” entity that will be updated and modified continually by the USGS as new information becomes available, or as obsolete materials are deleted.              Access this report via the WWW at: http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov              Upgrading the Seismic Instrumentation Network   A  major function of the USGS is to provide earthquake information quickly to other government agencies, emergency response organizations, utility companies, transportation entities, and others immediately affected by earthquakes. The USGS and Caltech have substantially improved seismic recording in southern California, and they have developed a program for continuing to upgrade the system to improve its reliability and speed of data transmission.   Specific goals of the instrumentation program are:       Recording and distributing ground-shaking information in near real time (within a few minutes of detection  of shaking) that can be used for estimating the extent and distribution of the resultant damages (see p. 72).   Maintaining the traditional functions of a strong-motion network; that is, onsite recording of strong shaking  (up to 2g) in the event of a telemetry failure.   Ensuring that the analysis system and telemetry are easily extended to include additional sensors, and are  able to readily interface with other regional seismic networks.   Ensuring that the network remains functional in the event of single-station failure.   Developing a pilot program on very rapid information transmission that can be used for early warning of strong  shaking.     The instrumentation program received startup funding through the NEHRP agreement (see p.4). Other funding sources include Pacific Bell Telephone for assistance in developing a telemetry system; the California OES through a proposal by Caltech and the CDMG; the NSF through a proposal by Caltech, and private funds raised by Caltech.   A USGS scientist kneels beside a portable seismograph station during the Northridge earthquake aftershock study. The site is a parking lot in front of the collapsed parking garage at California State University, Northridge.     Continuous GPS Monitoring   A  consortium of agencies (SCEC, USGS, and NASA) is currently installing a network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments throughout southern California. The network, named the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN), provides rapid, continuous measurements of ground deformation. As of April 1996, 38 stations were established, and there are plans for 30 more to be placed by the end of the year. Data have been collected from several stations that began operation in late summer 1994, and so far data quality has been excellent. The data are processed at the Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) in La Jolla and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena primarily through funding by the USGS, NSF, and NASA. .   Continuously recorded GPS data have provided a new baseline for studying compression of the Earth’s crust across southern California. Displacements due to compression may prove to be indicators of stress accumulation on blind thrust faults similar to the fault that ruptured in the Northridge earthquake.   Continuous GPS Monitoring All of the current and archived GPS raw data from the network are available through several anonymous  FTP  (file-transfer protocol) sites on the Internet (see p. 8). The most recent results of the continuously operating GPS array are analyzed by the USGS and researchers at SOPAC and JPL.              GPS results may be viewed on any of several sites on the WWW that may be accessed through the following Uniform    Resource Locator (URL):  http://scec/gps.caltech.edu/scign.html              Speeding Earthquake Disaster Relief Using CUBE (Caltech/USGS Broadcast of Earthquakes)   S cientists and engineers from the USGS and other institutions and agencies aided emergency managers by preparing a shaking-intensity map for the Los Angeles area (see p. 55). This map showed estimated severity of shaking and the levels of damage likely associated with such shaking. This map was available long before a complete picture of the damage could be assembled, and it enabled emergency managers to promptly locate the hardest hit areas and to send appropriate help. The shaking-intensity map was the first use of such a map to help focus relief efforts during a disaster.   To quickly prepare accurate shaking-intensity maps after an earthquake, essential information about the location, size, and nature of the earthquake was compiled. A comprehensive broadcast system for reporting this essential information was established in 1991 in southern California. The broadcast system, called CUBE, automatically reports earthquakes recorded by the 350-station southern California seismograph network operated by the USGS and Caltech. (A companion seismograph network and broadcast system reports earthquakes in northern California; similar networks are located in other earthquake-prone areas of the United States.)   Whenever a sizable earthquake strikes, designated scientists are notified via telephone pager. Subscribers to the CUBE system, such as railroad companies, utility companies, and television stations, are also simultaneously notified. Instead of a telephone number, the location, size, depth, and other information about the earthquake scroll across the pager display. This information is fed into a computer-modeling system that incorporates geological conditions of an area. Scientists use the modeling system to calculate the shaking intensity for different locales within a large area surrounding the earthquake’s epicenter. Thus, rapid, reliable information from seismograph networks, until recently used primarily for research, is proving its value during earthquake disaster-relief operations.   These are the basic elements of the broadcast system that transmits information about earthquakes in southern and northern California. Energy from earthquakes is recorded at numerous field stations on instruments called seismographs. These seismic signals are relayed nearly instantaneously from this seismograph network to analysis centers at Caltech in Pasadena and at the USGS in Menlo Park. From these centers, earthquake information including time, location, and magnitude is relayed to designated scientists and to system subscribers via pager within 1 or 2 minutes of an earthquake. The information can also be displayed as a map on a personal computer.     Special Publications -- Magazines and Fact Sheets   D uring 1994-96, the USGS produced several specialty documents related to the Northridge earthquake. These included two issues of the USGS magazine Earthquakes & Volcanoes devoted entirely to early findings about the earthquake, and several fact sheets in the series Reducing Earthquake Losses Throughout the United States. Printed copies of Earthquakes & Volcanoes, v. 25, nos. 1-2, 1994, and the fact sheet series (1995-96) may be obtained from the USGS using the following contact:       USGS Information Services   Box 25286, Building 810   Denver Federal Center   Denver, CO 80225-0046 USA   Tel: 303-202-4200   URL:  http://www.usgs.gov                 The fact sheet series is also available on the WWW at the following URL:       http://quake.wr.usgs.gov              The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Knowledge Transfer Program   T he USGS actively supports and collaborates with SCEC (see p. 7) in its scientific and knowledge-transfer functions through membership on SCEC’s Board of Directors. SCEC’s Knowledge Transfer Program, funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), targets end users—the people and entities who make ultimate use of scientific data and interpretations. Specifically, these include disaster preparedness officials, practicing engineering design professionals, policy makers, southern California business communities and industries, local, State and Federal government agencies, the media, and the general public. Knowledge-transfer activities consist of forums and workshops, discussions among groups of end users and scientists, documenting and publishing these interactions, and developing products compatible with user needs. In 1994, the SCEC Board of Directors endorsed the concept for a Research Utilization Planning Process that focused on full scientific participation throughout the process and in implementing the plan. The process distinguished the end users that should be targeted for product development from the end users who need information, but not in the form of specialty products. SCEC is now working toward producing several reports for specific end-user groups such as property and casualty insurance underwriters, civil and structural engineers, engineering geologists, urban planners, and the general public. Examples of collaborative knowledge transfer between the USGS and SCEC include the handbook Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country (described below), and the Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE) (see p.19). The very nature and contents of these two ventures—one for the general public, one for scientific researchers—clearly illustrates the breadth of communications achievable by the USGS and its collaborators.              “Putting Down Roots in Earthquake County” can be inspected on the WWW at:       http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/roots/roothome.html       Results from The Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE) are frequently updated on the WWW at:       http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/larse.html              “Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country” -- A Personal Handbook for Earthquake Safety   Part of the USGS effort to reach out to citizens is a 32-page personal handbook that was distributed through public libraries in southern California in October 1995. This handbook encourages earthquake awareness and preparedness by helping people understand the hazards we all face and what can be done about them. Many people in southern California and elsewhere do not take measures to prepare themselves for earthquakes for a variety of reasons, including fear, denial, and ignorance. We avoid thinking about the things that frighten us; we deny that rare events will affect us; and in many cases, we simply do not know what we can do to help ourselves. The new handbook  Putting Down Roots  in Earthquake Country speaks to our fear, denial, and ignorance in three parts:       The Earthquake Hazard —Confronting the Inevitable: How concerned should we be about earthquakes? The  handbook tells us what we can expect from the earthquake threat while we live in southern California.   The Earthquake Risk —Taking Control: Earthquakes are inevitable, but the damage from earthquakes is not.  We can take control of our environment to make our homes and workplaces safer. The handbook clearly illustrates  what individuals can do before, during, and immediately following an earthquake.   Earthquake ABC’s —Reviewing the Basics: Understanding reduces fear, and earthquakes and their effects  are understandable. The handbook offers clear explanations of earthquake science.        The handbook is a clearly written, profusely illustrated document carefully designed for easy reading and frequent reference. The many practical aspects of the handbook include an outline for an eight-step family earthquake plan and suggestions for training family members in earthquake safety.   The handbook was prepared and brought to southern Californians by the USGS, the National Science Foundation Southern California Earthquake Center, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, and other concerned businesses and organizations of southern California. Two million copies of the handbook were distributed in October 1995 to schools, companies, and the public through public libraries and the SCEC Knowledge Transfer Office.     From the Handbook...   “The road to earthquake safety.”   “We would all be better prepared for earthquakes if we knew when the next one was coming. However, unlike the storm front that must travel to you before rain can begin, there are no warning signs for earthquakes. We have found no scientifically verifiable way to predict earthquakes.”   “Even though we cannot predict the time of the next earthquake, science can help us live safely with earthquakes. The road to earthquake safety follows several steps. First, we must estimate what earthquakes of what size are likely to occur (geology). Given that earthquake, we then estimate what the shaking will be (seismology). Given that shaking, we estimate the response of different types of buildings (earthquake engineering). Only with all these steps completed can we take the steps as a society to enact building codes and retrofitting programs to make our community safer.”       Updating California’s Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program   T he State of California, through its Seismic Safety Commission, began a series of 5-year plans for the California Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in 1986. The report  California at Risk  details the plans and is updated annually to reflect new information and changing needs. The USGS contributes to the State program through membership on and liaison to the California Seismic Safety Commission, through participating regularly in updating the State report and by membership on FEMA’s post-disaster assessment teams whose recommendations are incorporated into State plans. As part of the response to the Northridge earthquake, the USGS participated on an interagency team that developed the 1994 post-earthquake update to California at Risk. This update, originally published separately as a 1994 Status Report will be fully integrated into the State Plan in late 1996. California at Risk is an excellent example of the link between scientific findings and applying those findings to earthquake-hazards reduction through updating building codes and changing and enacting legislation.

The network, which went on line in January 1999, ended a five-year gap during which there was only one operating station in Ohio. The state was dependent on seismographs in Kentucky and Michigan to record Ohio earthquakes.     It is surprising to many Ohioans that the state has experienced more than 160 felt earthquakes since 1776, and that 15 of these events have caused minor to moderate damage. The largest historic earthquake centered in Ohio was in 1937 in Shelby County. This event, estimated to have had a magnitude of about 5.4, caused considerable damage in Anna and several other western Ohio communities.  At least 40 earthquakes have been felt in the Anna area since 1875. Northeastern Ohio, east of Cleveland, including a 5.0 magnitude event in 1986 that caused moderate damage.  A broad area of southern Ohio has experienced more than 30 felt earthquakes.     The 23 stations of the Ohio Seismic Network are distributed across the state, but are concentrated in the most seismically active areas or in areas that provide optimal conditions for detecting and locating small earthquakes. These small earthquakes are important because they occur more frequently and help to identify the location of faults that may periodically produce larger, potentially damaging earthquakes.     The Ohio Seismic Network stations are located at colleges, universities, and other institutions. The seismographs employ new technology that not only makes them very accurate but also relatively inexpensive and easy to operate and maintain. In contrast to the old technology, in which a pen made a squiggly line on a paper drum, the new system is entirely digital and uses a Macintosh desktop computer to continuously record and display data. An inexpensive GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver is used to keep very precise time on the continuously recorded seismogram, and each station's computer is connected to the Internet for rapid data transfer. This system, including software to make all of the components work together and to analyze data, was developed by Dr. Larry J. Ruff at the University of Michigan.      Each seismograph station is a cooperative effort. The seismometer, the instrument that detects Earth motions, and other seismic components were purchased by the Division of Geological Survey with funds provided by the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) , through the  Ohio Emergency Management Agency , as part of the  National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program . The computers and Internet connection were purchased and provided by the cooperating institution.       The Division of Geological Survey coordinates the seismic network and operates from the Ohio Earthquake Information Center at the  Division's Laboratory  at Alum Creek State Park, north of Columbus. This facility functions as a repository and laboratory for rock core and well cuttings but has a specially constructed room for earthquake recording. The seismograph system allows for very rapid location of the epicenter and calculation of magnitude of any earthquake in the state. The earthquake records, or seismograms, from at least three seismograph stations are needed to determine earthquake locations (epicenters). These records can be downloaded from the Internet at any station on the network, and location and magnitude can be determined.      The Ohio Seismic Network provides a new dimension of understanding about the pulse of the Earth beneath Ohio. Although the seismograph network cannot predict earthquakes or provide an alert prior to an event, it provides insight into earthquake risk in the state so that intelligent decisions about building and facility design and construction, insurance coverage, and other planning decisions can be made by individuals, business and industry, and governmental agencies.

increases for this program total $876, of which $635 will be covered by     other program reductions and $241 will be absorbed.        Earthquake Hazards       Current Program Highlights       The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program provides the     scientific information and knowledge necessary to reduce deaths, injuries,     and economic losses from earthquakes.  Products of this program include     timely notifications of earthquake locations, size, and potential damage,     regional and national assessments of earthquakes hazards, and increased     understanding of the cause of earthquakes and their effects.       The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program is the applied     Earth science component of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program     (NEHRP) authorized by the "" Earthquake Hazards Reduction     Authorization Act of 2000 ,"" P.L. 106-503.  FEMA is the lead     agency of the national program and it coordinates the activities with the     three other principal NEHRP agencies:  USGS, National Science     Foundation (NSF), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).       The three basic elements of the USGS Earthquake     Hazards Program and their approximate budget share are:               Assessment and Characterization of Earthquake       Hazards, 40 percent.                         Monitoring, and reporting earthquake activity       and crustal deformation, 40 percent.                         Conducting Research into Earthquake Causes and       Effects, 20 percent.             These program areas are described in detail     below.  The USGS supports external research and monitoring activities     in each of these elements.  Approximately 25 percent of the total     Earthquake Hazards Program budget is directed toward research grants and     cooperative agreements with universities, State agencies, and private     technical firms.  The external work is carried out in all three     elements listed above.       Assessment and     Characterization of Earthquake Hazards  (estimates for FY 2000,     $8.2 million; FY 2001; $8.4 million; FY 2002, $8.6 million) -- The USGS     contributes to earthquake hazard mitigation strategies by estimating and     describing the likelihood and potential effects of moderate-to-large     earthquakes in high-risk regions of the United States, and by transferring     this knowledge to individuals, organizations, and agencies that can reduce     the impact of potentially damaging earthquakes.  Federal, State, and     local government agencies, architects and engineers, insurance companies and     other private businesses, land-use planners, emergency response officials,     and the general public rely on the USGS for earthquake hazard information to     refine building codes, develop land use strategies, safeguard lifelines and     critical facilities, develop emergency response plans, and take other     precautionary actions to reduce losses from future earthquakes.       Products for Earthquake Loss Reduction  --     USGS national seismic hazard maps are being used to develop new, unified     building codes for the United States.  The maps integrate geologic     mapping; fault locations, fault slip rates, and earthquake recurrence     intervals; and analyses of crustal deformation, ground-motion patterns, and     recent seismicity.  These maps are in digital format and give, as a     function of latitude and longitude, the maximum severity of ground shaking     (in terms of horizontal acceleration) that can be expected during exposure     periods of 50, 100, and 250 years.  As such, they are the basis for     applying the seismic design criteria contained in the building codes.      The maps and their associated databases are also being used to predict     earthquake losses and to define insurance risks.  A new seismic hazards     map for Hawaii was produced in 1999, and efforts are underway to produce     similar maps for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and     Guam.  Periodic review and updating of the seismic hazard maps to     incorporate new information are among the highest priorities for the USGS.      The next generation of maps is scheduled for release by the end of FY 2001,     and the USGS is working closely with earthquake researchers, engineers, and     State and local government representatives across the Nation to insure that     the base geologic data represent the most current and accurate information     available.       Earthquake Hazards Assessments in Urban Areas      -- The national scale earthquake hazards maps cannot take into account     variations in the amplitude and duration of seismic shaking caused by local     geologic structures and soil conditions.  The USGS is generating     products that address the specific hazards in high-to-moderate risk urban     areas, where the population and risks are greatest, such as the San     Francisco Bay area, and Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; Salt     Lake City, Utah; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charleston, South Carolina.      Earthquake shaking scenarios are being developed for public planning, and     modeling of ground motion is being provided for engineering     applications.  In conjunction with these products, the USGS conducts     workshops to assure the proper transfer of knowledge and to help design     effective mitigation.       Monitoring and     Reporting Earthquake Activity and Crustal Deformation  (estimates     for FY 2000, $19.0 million; FY 2001, $21.3 million; FY 2002, $21.5 million)     -- USGS has the assigned Federal responsibility for monitoring and     notification of seismic activity in the United States.  The USGS     fulfills this role by operating the U.S. National Seismograph Network (USNSN),     the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), and the National Strong     Motion Program (NSMP), and by supporting sixteen regional networks in areas     of moderate-to-high seismic activity.  All of these efforts are     coordinated under the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).  The     USGS also supports geodetic monitoring systems that measure the static     deformation of the Earth's crust due to earthquakes and     earthquake-generating processes.  The geodetic monitoring is done with     high-precision, land-based surveying techniques and the satellite-based     Global Positioning System (GPS).  Data derived from these monitoring     systems are used to identify seismic hazards and, following an earthquake,     to rapidly characterize the probable size and extent of damage, assess the     continuing risks from aftershocks and related ground-motion and     ground-failure hazards, and facilitate the work of response officials.       Regional Earthquake Monitoring  -- The USGS     and cooperating universities operate regional seismic networks in areas of     high seismicity.  Data from all U.S. seismic networks are used to     monitor active tectonic structures in much greater detail than is possible     with the national scale network.  Each region has a local data center     where the data are processed and regional catalogues of earthquakes are     produced.  These data centers serve as local distribution points for     information about earthquakes to the public, local and State agencies, and     other regional interests.  The regional data centers relay earthquake     data in real time to the National Earthquake Information Center as well as     to other regional networks.  Data centers also provide information     about regional earthquake hazards and accepted mitigation practices, and     those data centers located at universities provide training and research     facilities for students.       Monitoring Strong Motions Due to Earthquakes      -- Conventional seismometers used in earthquake monitoring networks cannot     accurately record strong ground and building motions caused by large, nearby     earthquakes, yet this technical data is extremely valuable for the design of     earthquake resistant buildings and other structures.  Through the     National Strong Motion Program, the USGS maintains about 840 strong motion     recorders in 35 States and territories.  The strong motion data show     the amplitude, frequency content, and duration of strong accelerations     caused by an earthquake.  These parameters are direct inputs to     computer models and scale models of structures to test their performance     under realistic earthquake shaking.       The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS)      -- In 2000, Congress authorized the upgrade of the seismic monitoring     networks in the United States through the implementation of an Advanced     National Seismic System (ANSS).  In the same legislation, Congress     requested an ANSS management plan that was delivered in May 2001.  The     ANSS is being used to improve management of the national and regional     seismic monitoring networks whenever funds are available to unify,     modernize, and expand earthquake monitoring equipment and activities in the     United States.  Implementation of an ANSS would involve five basic     components:  (1) An expanded U.S. National Seismographic Network; (2)     expanded and modernized regional networks; (3) creation of dense networks of     urban stations capable of monitoring strong motion both on the ground and in     structures; (4) two portable, temporary seismograph arrays that can be     rapidly deployed following an earthquake; and (5) upgrade and integration of     regional and national recording centers with the capability of disseminating     data and information in real time.  An important emphasis of ANSS is     improved monitoring in metropolitan areas in regions of high-to-moderate     seismic risk.  In total, ANSS envisions the addition of 6,000 new     seismic monitoring instruments in over 25 urban centers:  3,000 of     these would be deployed in reference sites (i.e., ground based) and an     additional 3,000 in structures.  Implementation of ANSS would also     result in improved integration of existing networks and the addition of     1,000 broadband stations in regional networks across the Nation.      Through the real-time hazards initiative, ANSS implementation efforts in FY     2000 focused on the installation of new recording sites in three     metropolitan areas:  Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle.      Instrumentation continued in these three urban centers in FY 2001, along     with new efforts in Anchorage, Memphis, and Reno.

Monitoring Changes in Shape of the Earth's     Surface  -- Geodetic networks provide essential information about     movement of the land surface near faults and earthquake source zones.      The USGS is working with universities and local agencies to conduct geodetic     investigations using GPS and laser-ranging surveys.  A dense network of     continuous GPS stations is being installed in Southern California, in     cooperation with NASA, NSF, and Scripps University, to determine the     distribution of long-term crustal deformation and the spatial and temporal     variations of the strain field.  During the next year, with funding     support from USGS cooperators, new stations will be sited and installed,     communications and data retrieval operations will be developed, and     processing and archiving centers will be established.  The USGS has a     lead role in operation of the network, with responsibility to maintain     stations and download and interpret the data.  In addition, the USGS is     investigating a new satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture     Radar (InSAR), that has the potential of quickly and accurately providing     large aerial maps of pre- and post-earthquake land deformation.  Work     is underway to develop computational tools necessary to efficiently analyze,     interpret, and model InSAR data.  The InSAR results in Southern     California will be used to augment, check, and if necessary, correct the     independent GPS measurements.       Conducting     Research into Earthquake Causes and Effects  (estimates for FY     2000, $7.6 million; FY 2001, $7.8 million; FY 2002, $7.9 million) -- The     USGS conducts research on the causes, characteristics, and effects of     earthquakes.  This research has direct application in earthquake     hazards assessments, earthquake forecasts, and earthquake mitigation     practices.       Studies of Earthquake Processes  -- A major     focus of USGS earthquake research is in understanding earthquake occurrence     in space and time.  Ongoing USGS investigations seek to understand the     physical conditions for earthquake initiation and growth; processes of     earthquake triggering; how individual faults in the same region interact;     why some faults slip slowly without generating earthquakes while others     generate earthquakes; and the factors that control variations in recurrence     intervals of earthquakes along the same fault.       Studies of Earthquake Effects  -- USGS     research efforts are also directed at improving the understanding of     earthquake-induced, strong ground shaking and its effects.      Specifically, USGS researchers are investigating how complexities in the     earthquake source, Earth's crust, and near-surface soils and deposits     influence seismic wave propagation and strong ground motion.  Improving     current techniques for forecasting the effects of strong ground motion will     greatly improve seismic hazard maps for urban regions; these efforts are     thus critical for cost-effective earthquake hazard mitigation.  Another     research priority is the identification and understanding of the behavior of     weak soils that liquefy and fail when subjected to earthquake shaking.      Research on ground failure, carried out in collaboration with structural and     geotechnical engineers, will lead to improved design of earthquake-resistant     infrastructure and lifelines, such as bridges and airports, commonly built     on fill or weak soil.       Short-Term Warnings  -- USGS earthquake     research also continues to address the problem of short-term warnings in the     days or hours before damaging earthquakes.  Well-documented geologic     and (or) hydrologic signals preceded the Loma Prieta and Kobe earthquakes,     warranting thorough investigation of these phenomena.  The ongoing USGS     earthquake prediction experiment at Parkfield, California, may permit not     only the recording of pre-earthquake signals, but also the possibility of     understanding their origin.  Additionally, the USGS will continue     research in the forecasting of earthquake aftershocks, which is of great     value to citizens and public safety officials in the aftermath of large     earthquakes.       Post-Earthquake Investigations  -- The USGS     responds to large domestic earthquakes and to some foreign earthquakes by     deploying portable seismic and geodetic instrumentation, conducting detailed     geologic field investigations, and evaluating damage patterns in relation to     geologic conditions and effects.  These investigations provide     essential information during and immediately after the emergency and an     opportunity to make substantial advances in our understanding of earthquake     geology and in the development of earthquake resistant design, construction,     and engineering practices.       External Cooperative Agreements and Grants  --     The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program supports a competitive, peer-reviewed,     external program of cooperative agreements and grants that enlists the     talents and expertise of State and local government, the academic community,     and the private sector.  The investigations and activities supported     though the external programs are closely coordinated with and complement the     internal USGS program efforts.  In general, routine monitoring efforts     are supported through 3-year cooperative agreements; research efforts are     supported through 1- or 2-year grants.  In FY 2001, 18 cooperative     agreements were funded to support regional seismic monitoring and long-term     research efforts in various parts of the country.  A total of 115     research grants were supported, 83 with universities and colleges, 9 with     State geological surveys, and 23 with private sector companies (see chart     below).  Many of the external projects are co-funded with other     agencies and sources, leveraging the effect of USGS support.  External     program activities include:  Monitoring and locating earthquakes by     regional seismographic networks, mapping seismic hazards in metropolitan     areas, developing credible earthquake planning scenarios including loss     estimates, defining the prehistoric record of large earthquakes,     investigating the origins of earthquakes, and improving methods for     predicting earthquake effects.  By involving the external community,     the USGS program increases its geographical and institutional impact,     promotes earthquake awareness across the Nation, encourages the application     of new hazards assessment techniques by State and local governments and the     private sector, and increases the level of technical knowledge within State     and local government agencies.  To support external work, $6.0 million     has been provided annually for competitively awarded earthquake research     grants; $3.0 million is provided through cooperative agreements for the     operation and maintenance of regional seismographic networks, and $1.1     million is provided to the Southern California Earthquake Center at the     University of Southern California in a cooperative agreement with the     university and the National Science Foundation.  The FY 2002 request     maintains this same level of funding.

The USGS national seismic hazard maps and     associated databases were recently used by FEMA to produce a landmark     national assessment of expected annualized losses from earthquakes (FEMA     report #366, released Sept. 2000).  Future distribution of Federal     funds for earthquake mitigation may, in the future, be tied to this     assessment.  In addition, USGS seismic hazard information is used by     numerous consulting companies to estimate earthquake losses for insurance     companies, pension funds, and other clients.  The USGS national hazard     maps are also used for regulatory purposes by the EPA for seismic design of     landfills.  In all of these cases, USGS national seismic hazard maps     allow users to assess the hazard and loss from future earthquakes, enabling     them to proactively mitigate the effects of these earthquakes and, hence,     save lives and property.       Seismic Hazard and Lifeline Maps in the Puget     Sound Region  -- A derivative product from regional hazard assessment     efforts in the Pacific Northwest has been the production of hazard maps with     critical transportation and utility lifelines superimposed.  These     lifeline maps were first generated for Kitsap County, WA, and were so well     received that counties up and down the I-5 corridor have requested that the     maps be extended to include their region.  Efforts are now underway to     extend the maps from the United States/Canada border, south to Eugene, OR;     Canadian counterparts will further extend the maps into British     Columbia.  Local counties in Washington and Oregon are providing     financial and technical assistance to complete this effort.  The maps     have been the primary means by which government officials have promoted     seismic retrofitting in the region.  Citizens recently approved     approximately $250 million for seismic retrofitting including the largest     voter-approved bond effort ever ($195 million).       USGS Hazard Information Used in Seismic Design     and Updating of Building Codes  -- A component of the seismic hazard     assessment effort is the preparation of design maps for use in model     building codes.  The USGS seismic hazard maps are incorporated into the      NEHRP Recommended Provisions , which serve as the resource documents     for the 2000 International Building Code (IBC) and the International     Residential Code (IRC).  The IBC and IRC are replacing regional-based     codes, which are expected to be implemented throughout the Nation, with     periodic updates every 3 years.       As part of the design map effort, USGS researchers     released a design CD-ROM that allows designers to easily locate pertinent     seismic map design parameters.  This represents significant timesavings     for designers who for the first time have a single source for all design     information.  The model code groups elected to include the CD with all     copies of the Code document that are sold.  There have been about     40,000 codes sold to date.       ANSS and Real-Time Hazards Seismic Monitoring     Upgrades  -- During FY 2000, the first 81 stations of the Advanced     National Seismic System (ANSS) were installed as part of the real-time     hazards initiative.  Forty of the 80 new ANSS strong motion stations in     FY 2000 were deployed in the San Francisco Bay area, while the remaining 40     were split equally between the Seattle and Salt Lake City regions.      Most of the new stations in the San Francisco Bay area were in place and     recording at the time of the September 5, 2000, magnitude 5.2 Yountville,     California, earthquake.  These instruments provided critical     information about why this quake caused so much damage in the vicinity of     Napa (see following re: ShakeMap).  In FY 2001, ANSS efforts will be     expanded to include three additional urban areas: Anchorage, Memphis, and     Reno; full implementation of ANSS would encompass over 25 urban areas across     the country.       Implementation of ""ShakeMap"" in     Northern California and the Yountville Earthquake  -- ShakeMap is a new     technique to estimate earthquake damage patterns and impact based on     instrumental recordings of seismic shaking in urban areas.  ShakeMap     was initially developed in Southern California where the real-time seismic     monitoring network (TriNet) allows for rapid computation of these     maps.  The ultimate goal is to provide a picture of an earthquake's     impact within minutes of the event so that emergency managers can speed     earthquake disaster relief, thereby saving lives.  Recent network     enhancements in northern California as part of ANSS have enabled preliminary     implementation of ShakeMap in this region as well.       On September 5, 2000, in response to the magnitude     5.2 Yountville earthquake, a ShakeMap was produced in northern California     just after the event and was updated as more data became available.      The ShakeMap confirmed human reports that the ground shaking resulting from     the Yountville earthquake was felt more strongly in the vicinity of Napa     (~10 miles away) than at the epicenter of the quake. (See:  http://quake.usgs.gov/recent/reports/napa/index.html ).      This may seem surprising, as seismic energy is typically strongest at the     earthquake's epicenter, dissipating outward.  However, two other     factors also influenced ground shaking in this event: the amplification of     shaking by young sediments along the Napa River; and the focusing of strong     motion to the southeast, the direction the earthquake rupture     propagated.  These contributing factors are evident on the ShakeMap,     which was designed with precisely this situation in mind - when damage is     not symmetric about an earthquake's origin.  ShakeMap can thus be a     powerful tool in the minutes and hours that follow an event in identifying     the likely distribution of damage.  Once ANSS network upgrades in the     San Francisco Bay area are complete, the technology will be in place to     generate ShakeMaps within the first several minutes following the onset of     shaking, thereby further facilitating emergency response efforts.       Earthquake Probabilities Calculated for     Istanbul, Turkey  -- The large Izmit and Düzce earthquakes that occurred     in Turkey in 1999 represent the latest in a series of westward-propagating,     large earthquakes on the North Anatolian fault since 1939.  If the     sequence of earthquakes continues to progress westward, then Istanbul, the     largest urban center in Turkey with a population of 10 million people, could     experience severe shaking because the city lies just north of the western     branching of the fault into the Marmara Sea.  The North Anatolian fault     is an excellent analog to the San Andreas fault, and as such, offers     important insights into strike-slip faulting processes that may be relevant     to California as well as Turkey.  For this reason, USGS scientists have     long been interested in the behavior of the North Anatolian fault, and most     recently have attempted to model its behavior.  Working with Turkish     counterparts, the USGS, in FY 2000, released a report estimating the     probability of a large earthquake striking near Istanbul.  The estimate     was based on a calibrated catalog of the historic earthquakes in the region     during the last 500 years and took into account the effect of stress     transfer from the most recent events.  USGS scientists computed a 62 ±     15 percent chance over the next 30 years and a 32 ± 12 percent chance     during the next 10 years of strong shaking from a large earthquake near     Istanbul.  The USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Office of Foreign     Disaster Assistance, is now involved in follow-up efforts with Turkish     scientists to enhance these models and to develop prototype microzonation     maps that can be used to locally assess seismic risk and guide seismic     retrofitting efforts.  The USGS will also consult with scientists at     the Kandilli Observatory in Ankara on efforts to upgrade seismic monitoring     networks in Turkey.       Studies of Prehistoric Earthquake Clustering in     the Seattle Region  -- The USGS conducts paleoseismology studies at a     number of sites across the United States to determine past earthquake     chronologies.  New studies in the Seattle region, along a newly     discovered strand of the Seattle fault, document at least three     surface-rupturing earthquake between 3,000 and 1,000 years ago.  In     contrast, these same studies show that no earthquake faulting or folding is     believed to have occurred during the preceding 7,000-13,000 years.  The     data suggest that an episode of earthquake clustering occurred (irregular     recurrence) at this site, approximately 12-kilometers west of downtown     Seattle.  Earthquake clustering on the Seattle fault implies that     similar clusters may characterize other, unstudied faults in the Puget     lowland.       Nisqually Earthquake  -- A magnitude 6.8     earthquake occurred 10 miles northeast of Olympia, Washington, on February     28, 2001.  The earthquake was widely felt in the Puget Sound area and     caused over $2 billion of damage in Olympia, Tacoma, and Seattle.      Fortunately, only one death and about 200 injuries were reported.  An     earthquake of similar magnitude, 6.7, occurred near Los Angeles in 1994,     killing over 60 and causing $40 billion in losses.       There are two dominant reasons for the contrast in     impact of these two earthquakes of similar magnitude:               The first is the difference in depth of the       earthquakes.  The earthquake near Seattle occurred 30 miles deep       within the Earth; the Los Angeles earthquake was less than 10 miles       deep.  The strong seismic shaking from the deeper Seattle earthquake       was attenuated as it traveled the extra 20 miles to reach the surface.                         The second reason is earthquake       preparedness.  The USGS Earthquake Program has been working in the       Seattle area for the past 15 years to assess earthquake hazards and to       relay these assessments to local officials in ways that could be       understood and acted upon.  The USGS has personnel stationed in       Seattle who work closely with geologists and seismologists at the       University of Washington.  This combined effort, through a series of       publications, briefings, and public workshops, raised the awareness of the       earthquake hazard in the region and led to the implementation of       mitigation measures.  For example, the USGS helped form the Cascadia       Region Earthquake Working Group (CREW), a consortium of private interests       such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Bank of America, which has been taking       measures to reduce the regional economic risks due to earthquakes in the       area.             The USGS recognized the importance of measuring     the severity and variation of strong ground shaking in the urban area during     an earthquake.  This data is essential for effective earthquake     resistant design, construction, and retrofitting of buildings.  In FY     2000, under a Real-Time Hazard initiative, which began the implementation of     the ANSS, 20 modern seismometers, capable of recording earthquakes of     magnitude 8, were installed in the Seattle region.  All 20 of these new     instruments worked during the earthquake and provided immediate information     on the severity and regional distribution of strong ground shaking.       Digital Fault Database for the United States      -- During FY 2001, the USGS completed compilation of a database containing     information on all known geologic faults in the United States active within     the last 2 million years (Quaternary).  This enormous task has     involved:  (1) Literature searches for information, with field checking     in some cases, on all Quaternary faults; (2) synthesizing data and compiling     concise descriptions in a common format; and (3) digitizing the faults     traces for inclusion in a Geographic Information System (GIS) with links to     the fault characteristics in the accompanying database.  The     compilation includes data for fault slip rates and the size and dates of     associated earthquake.  This database is structured so that new or     revised information can be entered easily in a standard format.  This     type of information is crucial for the revision of future national and     regional earthquake hazard maps and for developing earthquake scenarios for     emergency preparedness.                                                                                                                                                                                               Return to Office of Budget    For more information, contact:  cburzyk@usgs.gov           Privacy Statement     Disclaimer     FOIA     Accessibility                  U.S. Department of the Interior ,   U.S. Geological Survey  URL http://www.usgs.gov/budget/2002_Justification/02earthquake.html   Contact Us   Last modification: 19-Aug-2002@07:33"
