This list is also posted on the Inspector General Community's website,   IGNET, at http://www.ignet.gov.

Federal Entities are required to report annually to each House of the     Congress and OMB on audit and investigative activities in their organizations.     Federal Entities are defined as ""any Government corporation (within the meaning     of section 103 (1) of title 5, United States Code), any Government controlled     corporation (within the meaning of section 103 (2) of such title), or any other     entity in the Executive Branch of government, or any independent regulatory     agency"" other than the Executive Office of the President and agencies with     statutory Inspectors General.
