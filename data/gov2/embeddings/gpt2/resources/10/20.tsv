GX002-33-11824170	"Comparison            of Landsat 7 Level-0R and Level-1G Data                                    The two images below (subsections            of a full Landsat scene) illustrate the difference between Level 0R            and Level 1G. All Landsat 7 data will be archived as Level 0R and will            be available to users in that format or as Level 1G             Level 0R data is corrected            for scan line direction and band alignment only. No radiometric or geometric            correction is applied. In the example below, the pixel values have been            stretched to make the image more ""viewable"", but the geometric distortions            are as they will appear.             The Level 1G image is typical            of the products currently available from the Landsat system; geometric            corrections were applied.             Both images were generated            at EDC from data acquired November 6, 1984 over central Florida by the            Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5. The Level 0R image was            processed from a station tape (HDDT) using the TMACs system developed            by Hughes STX. The Level 1G image was processed through EDC's EL1PS            (EDC Level 1 Prototype System). The same three bands were used in each            image.                                       Landsat 0R image (320 kbytes)                               Landsat 1G image (352 kbytes)                               (Images courtesy of C.

GX002-80-4380911	Landsat TM Scene over the ARM NSA Barrow Site.                         MAP INFORMATION     This Landsat TM Scene (composite of bands 7,4,2) was taken on July 31, 1992 (path 80/row 10) at 21:26 GMT. The image is partially cloud covered (especially over the Barrow site). The colors roughly correspond to the following: dk. blue and blue- water, green- vegetation, dk. brown- soil (sparsely vegetated), dk. pink/red- roads and trails, whitish/pink, lt. gray/green- clouds    Sub-scene derived from Landsat TM scene provided by R.
