GX035-74-13307641	"Front Page       Previous Story       Next Story           NIH Holds First Symposium on Human Embryonic Stem Cells    Scientists at the first NIH research symposium on recent progress                and future promise of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) proved                that, as in many things, timing and location are everything.                Understanding the molecular and cellular processes that regulate                normal human embryonic cell differentiation into multiple types of                cells poses many challenges. Other challenges are embedded in                understanding the unique capacity of these fledgling cells to be both                pluripotent and indefinitely self-renewing.                    On June 12, an overflow crowd in Masur Auditorium witnessed, in                person and by webcast, the intriguing possibilities of emerging                knowledge about hESCs and opportunities to interweave and to                share breaking information. Principal investigators representing                laboratories both within NIH and from across the country raised key                questions about molecular signaling that leads to the differentiation                of hESCs into specific cell types.                    Dr. James F. Battey, Jr., director of the National Institute on                Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and chairman of the                NIH stem cell task force, opened the meeting with the hope and                plan that this should be the first of many such symposia. The task                force is a team of leading scientists who meet with and seek advice                from scientific leaders in order to advance the field of stem cell                research.         NINDS' Dr. Ron McKay                               In introducing the first plenary panel devoted to discussion of the                characterization of undifferentiated stem cells, NIEHS's Michael                McClure harkened back to the Yankees' accidental pundit Yogi                Berra's famous observation — ""If you don't know where                you're going, you'll be lost when you get there."" Leading off the                session, Ron McKay, a principal investigator in the NINDS                intramural program, cautioned that in looking at therapeutic                possibilities of hESCs in the future, it is imperative that the hESC                ""makes exactly the right kind of neuron."" Daniella Gerhard from                NCI described her investigation of the transcriptome of a number of                currently available cell lines. Her presentation underscored the                importance of shared resources. Mahendra Rao from NIA is also                developing infrastructure resources for human embryonic stem cell                research, and focused on understanding of developmental                mechanisms that are likely to lead to novel approaches in preventing                and treating neurological disorders of aging. Using a prototype for                the targeted acquisition of desired neuronal phenotypes, Steven                Goldman, an extramural investigator at Weill Medical College of                Cornell University, described the induction and isolation of spinal                motor neurons from hESC.          NIDCD director Dr. James Battey Jr. (foreground) listens to                presentation as part of Masur Auditorium audience.                                     John Thomas from NHLBI introduced the second panel exploring                topics related to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. George                Daley from the Whitehead Institute described characterization of                signaling pathways that trigger self-renewal. His team is using                methods of viral gene transduction to accomplish this work. Dan                Kaufman, from the University of Minnesota, focused his discussion                on the role of stromal cell co-culture to promote differentiation into                hematopoietic cells. Timothy Kamp, from the University of                Wisconsin Medical School, described the ability of hESCs to                provide a renewable source of distinct types of human cardiac                myocytes. This ability may have application for pharmacological                testing and possible therapeutic applications. Esmail D. Zanjani from                Sierra Biomedical Research Corp., reported on his work using fetal                sheep. His team's work shows that cells derived from hESCs can                engraft and undergo multilineage differentiation. Gordon Zeller from                the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine focused on ways to promote                differentiation into one of the three developmental lineages:                ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.        Participating in a panel discussion are (from l) Dr. John                McDonald III, Washington University, St. Louis; Dr. Su-Chun                Zhang, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Dr. James Huettner,                also of Washington University, St. Louis.                     Thaddeus Golos, University of Wisconsin, presented his findings on                hESC differentiation into placental trophoblast cells and on placental                morphogenesis. James Huettner from Washington University in St.                Louis emphasized in his discussion that ""the development of                successful therapies for neurodegenerative disorders involving hESC                cells will require the functional evaluation of electrical signaling                capability."" Su-Chun Zhang, University of Wisconsin Medical                School, described the neural specification of hESC, noting the                importance of understanding neural induction and patterning in                humans; this can lead to an optimized procedure for generating                enriched or purified neuroepithelia and specialized neural cells. John                McDonald III's group, also at Washington University in St. Louis, is                investigating ultrastructural features of hESC that can lead to novel                strategies of CNS repair in both mouse models and, eventually, in                humans.                    At the conclusion of the plenary session, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, NIH                director, noted, ""There is no better way to assess the state of the                science than to have the best scientists who are really doing it                assembled in one place together."" Observing that the acceleration of                research on hESCs must be built upon a foundation of facts,                Zerhouni added, ""I have a personal commitment and NIH is fully                committed [to move] as fast as we can and provide the resources to                do so...I want the science to drive the agenda.""                Dr. Elias Zerhouni  A noontime poster session of work from six laboratories was                followed by workshops on material transfer agreements and                intellectual property issues of stem cell research; hESC research                training; federal guidelines on stem cell research; NIH                implementation; and culture techniques for hESCs.                  The symposium was developed by a planning committee that                included representatives from 9 institutes and the Office of the                Director, NIH, including NIDCD's Battey, chair; L. Tony Beck,                NCRR; Jill Carrington, NIA; Della Hann, OD; Eleni Kousvelari,                NIDCR; Michael E. McClure, NIEHS; Belinda Seto, OD;                Beth-Anne Sieber, NIMH; Richard J. Tasca, NICHD; John W.                Thomas, NHLBI; Baldwin Wong, NIDCD; and Marion Zatz,                NIGMS.

Cyber-mentoring, or Ementoring         as it's sometimes called, means working with a student interested in         a field with his/her school work, projects and interests. It also         means helping the student explore the possibility of making the field         his/her career. Meetings with the  student are face to face at his/her         high school initially and once a month thereafter but otherwise communication         is primarily by email or by telephone.          The program will serve Santa Fe, Pojoaque and Española high schools.                    Mentoring New Mexico, a non-profit mentoring program, will provide the         necessary training (at the Lab), background checks (as needed) and will       match you with an appropriate student by field.

Updated 1/9/03                         Employees leaving Lab must attend termination presentation         Employees who are leaving the Laboratory or changing to casual status          must attend a benefits termination presentation held by Benefits (HR-B).         The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).         Because of limited parking, employees should plan to arrive early and/or          make alternative transportation arrangements, such as using Johnson Controls          Northern New Mexico's ride service.

As a result of that effort,    Project XL was initiated in 1985 as a national partnership designed to encourage    proliferation of such programs and to develop new programs and materials which    will promote critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills for all    children in our Nation's schools.      The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT is one of the many projects included in this national outreach program. It should be used in conjunction with a thinking skills program as a means of applying critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills through the activity of creating an innovation or invention.     When a student is asked to ""invent"" a solution to a problem, the student must draw upon previous knowledge, skills, and experience. The student also recognizes areas where new learnings must be acquired in order to understand or address the problem. This information must then be applied, analyzed, synthesized, and evaluated. Through critical and creative thinking and problem-solving, ideas become reality as children create inventive solutions, illustrate their ideas, and make models of their inventions. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides children with opportunities to develop and practice higher-order thinking skills.     Throughout the years, many thinking skills models and programs have been generated from among America's finest educators, seeking to describe the essential elements of thinking and/or to develop a systematic approach to teaching thinking skills as part of the school curricula. Three such models/descriptions are illustrated in this introduction. Although each uses different terminology, each model describes similar elements of either critical or creative thinking, or both. A review of the models of BLOOM, TAYLOR, and ISAKSEN and TREFFINGER show how the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides an opportunity for students to ""experience"" most of the elements described in these models.       Benjamin Bloom's Model        Perhaps most familiar to educators is ""BLOOM'S taxonomy."" Bloom describes the major areas in the cognitive domain. This information is drawn from the  Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Handbook 1: Cognitive Domain  (1956). The taxonomy begins by defining KNOWLEDGE as the remembering of previously learned material. Knowledge, according to Bloom, represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain. Knowledge is followed by COMPREHENSION, the ability to grasp the meaning of material and goes just beyond the knowledge level. Comprehension is the lowest level of understanding. APPLICATION is the next area in the hierarchy and refers to the ability to use learned material in new and concrete principles and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than comprehension.     In    ANALYSIS, the next area of the taxonomy, the learning outcomes require an understanding    of both the content and the structural form of material. Next is SYNTHESIS,    which refers to the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. Learning    outcomes at this level stress creative behaviors with a major emphasis on the    formulation of new patterns or structures. The last level of the taxonomy is    EVALUATION. Evaluation is concerned with the ability to judge the value of material    for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria. Learning    outcome s in this area are the highest in the cognitive    hierarchy because they incorporate or contain elements of knowledge, comprehension,    application, analysis, and synthesis. In addition, they contain conscious value    judgments based on clearly defined criteria. The activity of inventing encourages    the four highest levels of learning--application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation--in    addition to knowledge and comprehension.        Calvin Taylor's Model -- Talents    Unlimited      The second model is introduced by Calvin Taylor in Chapter XI and is discussed in a summary chapter by Carol Schlichter in Joseph Renzulli's book entitled  Systems and Models for Developing Programs for the Gifted and Talented  (1986). The Taylor model describes the talent areas as PRODUCTIVE THINKING, COMMUNICATION, PLANNING, DECISION MAKING, and FORECASTING. This work is best known as TALENTS UNLIMITED, a program of the National Diffusion Network of the U.S. Department of Education. The Taylor model incorporates both the critical and creative elements of thinking. Rather than a taxonomy, this is a thinking skills model that describes the essential elements of thinking, beginning with the academic talent and then incorporating the other talent areas, as described in more detail below.     PRODUCTIVE THINKING promotes creative thinking in the    Taylor model. It suggests thinking of many ideas, varied ideas, unusual ideas,    and adding to those ideas.        COMMUNICATION has six elements which include:      *  give many, varied, single words to describe something;     *  give many, varied, single words to describe feelings;     *  think of many, varied things that are like another thing in a special way;     *  let others know that you understand how they feel;     *  make a network of ideas using many, varied and complete thoughts;     *  tell your feelings and needs without using words.     PLANNING requires that students learn to tell:     *  what they are going to plan;     *  the materials that they will need;     *  the steps that they will need to accomplish the task; and     *  the problems that might occur.     DECISION MAKING teaches the student to:     *  think of the many, varied things that could be done;     *  think more carefully about each alternative;     *  choose one alternative that they think is best; and     *  give many, varied reasons for the choice.     FORECASTING is the last of the five talents and requires students to make many, varied predictions about a situation, examining cause and effect relationships. Every element of the TAYLOR model is used when a child invents.     Creative Problem Solving Model      The third model developed by Scott Isaksen and Donald Treffinger as described in the book  Creative Problem Solving: The Basic Course  (1985) by Isaksen and Treffinger and published in Buffalo, New York, by Bearly Limited, also describes both critical and creative thinking. CREATIVE THINKING is described as making and communicating connections to: think of many possibilities; think and experience in various ways and use different points of view; think of new and unusual possibilities; and guide in generating and selecting alternatives. CRITICAL THINKING is described as analyzing and developing possibilities to: compare and contrast many ideas; improve and refine ideas; make effective decisions and judgments; and provide a sound foundation for effective action. These definitions are used in a six-stage, problem-solving process. A brief description of each of the six stages follows:     1. Mess Finding:  Just what's the mess that needs cleaning up, the situation that demands our attention? We have to identify and acknowledge this first before we can proceed.     2. Data Finding:  Once the general mess is defined, the next stage involves ""taking stock""--unearthing and collecting information, knowledge, facts, feelings, opinions, and thoughts to sort out and clarify your mess more specifically. What do you know about the situation, and what do you still need to know?     3. Problem Finding:  Now that your data is collected, you need to formulate a ""problem statement"" that expresses the ""heart"" of the situation. You must try to put aside the common assumption that you ""already know what the problem is"" and try to state the problem in such a manner as to invite novel perspectives on it.     4. Idea Finding:  This is the state in which you brainstorm as many ideas or alternatives as possible for dealing with your problem statement. Don't evaluate your ideas at this point, merely list them as an idea pool from which you'll draw in putting together a variety of solutions to your problem.      5. Solution Finding:  Now that you have a number of ideas that can serve as possible solutions to your problem, it's time to evaluate them systematically. To do this you have to generate a variety of criteria and select the most important for your problem. Is it cost? expediency? pleasure? time involvement? etc. In this way, you'll be able to identify and evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of possible solutions.     6. Acceptance Finding:  Having decided upon a solution, it's time to formulate a plan of action to implement your solution. Determine what kind of help you'll need, what obstacles or difficulties might get in the way, and what specific short- and long-term steps you are going to take to rid yourself of that original mess!     Now that you have reviewed these examples, you will see    the critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills and talents that    can be applied through the activity of inventing. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM    PROJECT that follows can be used across all disciplines and grade levels and    with         all children. It can be integrated with all curricular    areas and used as a means of applying the concepts or elements of any thinking    skills program that may be in use in your school district. Participation in    this project will provide your students with an excellent opportunity to experience    the highest levels of thinking. Activities can be adapted to the developmental    and academic needs of the class.      We hope that you will join Project XL in this national effort, by developing your own program for promoting the teaching of inventive thinking and problem-solving skills. Use the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT as a springboard for capturing the imagination, interest, and creativity that each of us has within our reach. The children of this Nation are our very best investment in tomorrow. Our future will be brighter if we add a big ""T"" for thinking to the basic 3 ""Rs"" of the school curricula.     A special project that provides a unique opportunity for children of all ages to develop their problem-solving and inventive thinking skills in an integrated learning activity can be implemented at your school. Just use the procedures, activities, and guidelines in this booklet to create your own exciting program.     Children of all ages are talented and creative. This project will give them an opportunity to develop their creative potential and synthesize and apply knowledge and skills by creating an invention or innovation to solve a problem, just as a ""real"" inventor would.              ACTIVITIES              Activity #1      INTRODUCING INVENTIVE THINKING      ""Imagination is more important than knowledge, for    imagination embraces the world.""     Albert Einstein      1. Read the stories  in the back of this guide    (p. 27)or copy them for the students to read themselves. Ask students, ""How    did these inventors get their ideas? How did they make their ideas a reality?""    Locate books in your library about inventors, invention, and creativity. Older    students can locate these references themselves.      2. Invite a local inventor  to speak to the class.    Since local inventors are not usually listed in the phone book, you can find    them by calling a local patent attorney or your local intellectual property    law association. Your community may also have a Patent and Trademark Depository    Library or an inventor's society that you may contact. If not, most of your    major companies have a research and development department made up of people    who think inventively for a living.      3. Next, ask the students to look  at the things    in the classroom that are inventions. All the inventions in the classroom that    have a U.S. patent will have a patent number. One such item is probably the    pencil sharpener. Tell them to check out their house for patented items. Let    the students list all of the inventions they discover. What would improve these    inventions?      4. In order to guide your students  through the    inventive process, a few preliminary lessons dealing with creative thinking    will help set the mood. Begin with a brief explanation of brainstorming and    a discussion on the rules of brainstorming (see p. 10).      Brainstorming      Brainstorming is a process of spontaneous thinking used by an individual or by a group of people to generate numerous alternative ideas while deferring judgment. Introduced by Alex Osborn in his book  Applied Imagination,  brainstorming is the crux of each of the stages of all problem-solving methods.     RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING          NO    CRITICISM ALLOWED.  People tend to automatically evaluate each suggested    idea--their own as well as others. Both internal and external criticism are    to be avoided while brainstorming. Neither positive nor negative comments are    allowed. Either type inhibits the free flow of thought and requires time which    interferes with the next rule. Write each spoken idea down as it is given and    move on.           WORK FOR QUANTITY.  Alex Osborn stated that ""Quantity    breeds quality."" People must experience a ""braindrain"" (get all the common responses    out of the way) before the innovative, creative ideas can surface; therefore,    the more ideas, the more likely they are to be quality ideas.           HITCHHIKING WELCOME.  Hitchhiking occurs when one    member's idea produces a similar idea or an enhanced idea in another member.    All ideas should be recorded.           FREEWHEELING ENCOURAGED.  Outrageous, humorous, and    seemingly unimportant ideas should be recorded. It is not uncommon for the most    off-the-wall comment to be one wherein lies the solution for the problem.        Activity #2      PRACTICING THE CREATIVE PART        OF INVENTIVE THINKING     1. Cultivate the following creative thinking processes    described by Paul Torrance and discussed in  The Search for Satori and Creativity     (1979).          FLUENCY the production of a great number of ideas.            FLEXIBILITY the production of ideas or products that    show a variety of possibilities or realms of thought.            ORIGINALITY the production of ideas that are unique    or unusual.          ELABORATION the production of ideas that display intensive detail or enrichment.      For    practice in elaboration, have pairs or small groups of students choose a particular    idea from the brainstorming list and add the flourishes and details that would    develop the idea more fully.      Allow the students to share their innovative and inventive ideas!       2. Once your students have become familiar with the rules    of brainstorming and the creative thinking processes, Bob Eberle's SCAMPER technique    for brainstorming could be introduced.      S UBSTITUTE What else instead? Who else instead? Other ingredients? Other material? Other power? Other place?     C OMBINE How about a blend, an alloy, an ensemble? Combine purposes? Combine appeals?     A DAPT What else is like this? What other idea does this suggest? Does past offer parallel? What could I copy?     M INIFY Order, form, shape? What to add? More time?     M AGNIFY Greater frequency? Higher? Longer? Thicker?     P UT TO OTHER USES New ways to use as is? Other uses I modified? Other places to use? Other people to reach?     E LIMINATE What to subtract? Smaller? Condensed? Miniature? Lower? Shorter? Lighter? Omit? Streamline? Understate?     R EVERSE Interchange components? Other pattern?     R EARRANGE Other layout? Other sequence? Transpose cause and effect? Change pace? Transpose positive and negative? How about opposites? Turn it backward? Turn it upside-down? Reverse roles?     3. Bring in any object or use objects around the classroom to do the following exercise. Ask the students to list many new uses for a familiar object by using the SCAMPER technique with regard to the object. You could use a paper plate to begin with, and see how many new things the students will discover. Make sure to follow the rules for brainstorming in Activity #1.     4. Using literature, ask your students to create a new    ending to a story, change a character or situation within a story, or create    a new beginning for the story that would result in the same ending.      5. Put a list of objects on the chalkboard. Ask your    students to combine them in different ways to create a new product.      Let the students make their own list of objects. Once    they combine several of them, ask them to illustrate the new product and explain    why it might be useful.            Activity #3      PRACTICING INVENTIVE THINKING    WITH THE CLASS     Before your students begin to find their own problems    and create unique inventions or innovations to solve them, you can assist them    by taking them through some of the steps as a group.      1. Finding the Problem.  Let the class list problems in their own classroom that need solving. Use the ""brainstorming"" technique from Activity #1. Perhaps your students never have a pencil ready, as it is either missing or broken when it is time to do an assignment. Select one problem for the class to solve using the following steps:      a. Find several problems. Select one to work on.      b. Analyze the situation.      c. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem.     List the possibilities. Be sure to allow even the silliest possible solution, as creative thinking must have a positive, accepting environment in order to flourish.       2. Finding a Solution.       a. Select one or more possible solutions to work on. You may want to divide into groups if the class elects to work on several of the ideas.      b. Improve and refine the idea(s).      c. Share the class or individual solution(s)/invention(s) for solving the class problem.     Solving a ""class"" problem and creating a ""class"" invention    will help students learn the process and make it easier for them to work on    their own invention projects.              Activity #4      DEVELOPING AN INVENTION IDEA        Now that your students have had an introduction to the inventive process, it is time for them to find a problem and create their own invention to solve it.     1. Begin by asking your students to conduct a survey. Tell them to interview everyone that they can think of to find out what problems need solutions. What kind of invention, tool, game, device, or idea would be helpful at home, work, or during leisure time? (see p. 39)     2. Ask the students to list the problems that need to be solved.     3. Next comes the decision-making process. Using the list of problems, ask the students to think of which problems would be possible for them to work on. They can do this by listing the pros and cons for each possibility. Predict the outcome or possible solution(s) for each problem. Make a decision by selecting one or two problems that provide the best options for an inventive solution. (Duplicate the Planning and Decision-Making Framework p. 41)     4. Begin an Inventor's Log or Journal. A record of your ideas and work will help you develop your invention and protect it when completed. (Sample log sheet on p. 51.)          RULES FOR AUTHENTIC     JOURNAL KEEPING      *  Using a bound    notebook, make notes each day about the things you do and learn while working    on your invention.      *  Record your    idea and how you got it.      *  Write about    problems you have and how you solve them.      *  Write in ink    and do not erase.      *  Add sketches    and drawings to make things clear.      *  List all parts,    sources, and costs of materials.      *  Sign and date    all entries at the time they are made and have them witnessed.             5. To illustrate why record-keeping is important, read the following story about Daniel Drawbaugh who said that he invented the telephone, but didn't have one single paper or record to prove it.        Long before Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application in 1875, Daniel Drawbaugh claimed to have invented the telephone. But since he had no journal or record, the Supreme Court rejected his claims by four votes to three. Alexander Graham Bell had excellent records and was awarded the patent for the telephone.     Activity #5      BRAINSTORMING FOR CREATIVE    SOLUTIONS           Now that the students have one or two problems to work on, they must take the same steps that they did in solving the class problem in Activity #3. These steps could be listed on the chalkboard or a chart.     1. Analyze the problem(s). Select one to work on.     2. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem. List all of the possibilities. Be non-judgmental. (See Brainstorming in Activity #1 and SCAMPER in Activity #2.)     3. Select one or more possible solutions to work on.     4. Improve and refine your ideas.     Now that your students have some exciting possibilities    for their invention projects, they will need to use their critical thinking    skills to narrow down the possible solutions. They can do this by asking themselves    the following questions about their inventive idea:      Activity #6      PRACTICING THE CRITICAL PARTS    OF     INVENTIVE THINKING            1. Is my idea practical?     2. Can it be made easily?     3. Is it as simple as possible?     4. Is it safe?     5. Will it cost too much to make or use?     6. Is my idea really new?     7. Will it withstand use, or will it break easily?     8. Is my idea similar to something else?     9. Will people really use my invention? (Survey your classmates or the people in your neighborhood to document the need or usefulness of your idea.)       Activity #7      COMPLETING THE INVENTION      When students have an idea that meets most of the above    qualifications, they need to plan how they are going to complete their project.    The following planning technique will save them a great deal of time and effort:      1. Identify the problem and possible solution. Give your invention a name.     2. List the materials needed to illustrate your invention and to make a model of it. You will need paper, pencil, and crayons or markers to draw your invention. You might use cardboard, paper, clay, wood, plastic, yarn, paper clips, and so forth to make a model. You might also want to use an art book or a book on model-making from your school library.     3. List, in order, the steps for completing your invention.     4. Think of the possible problems that might occur. How would you solve them?     5. Complete your invention. Ask your parents and teacher    to help with the model.                                     REMEMBER!            * WHAT  -          describe the problem            * MATERIALS           - list the materials needed            * STEPS  -          list the steps to complete your invention            * PROBLEMS           - predict the problems that could occur.                           Activity #8      NAMING THE INVENTION        An invention can be named in one of the    following ways:    1. Using the inventor'sBraille name          Levi Strauss = LEVI'S ®  jeans            Louis Braille = Alphabet System           2. Using the components or ingredients of the invention           Root Beer         Peanut Butter                  3. With initials or acronyms          IBM ®         S.C.U.B.A. ®           4. Using word combinations (notice repeated consonant sounds and rhyming words).           KIT KAT ®         HULA HOOP ®        PUDDING POPS ®           CAP'N CRUNCH ®           5. Using the product's function           SUPERSEAL ®          DUSTBUSTER ®          vacuum cleaner           hairbrush           earmuffs           Activity #9      OPTIONAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES      Students can be very fluent when it comes to listing ingenious    names of products out on the market. Solicit their suggestions and have them    explain what makes each name effective. Each student should generate names for    his/her own invention.        1. Developing a slogan or jingle      Have the students define the terms ""slogan"" and ""jingle."" Discuss the purpose of   having a slogan.               Sample slogans and jingles:      ""Things go better with Coke.""   ""COKE IS IT! ® ""   ""TRIX ARE FOR KIDS ® ""   ""OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-ELEVEN ® ""   ""TWOALLBEEFPATTIES...""   ""GE: WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE! ® ""      Your students will be able to recall many slogans and jingles! When a slogan is named, discuss the reasons for its effectiveness. Allow time for thought in which the students can create jingles for their inventions.       2. CREATING AN ADVERTISEMENT         For a crash course in advertising, discuss the visual effect created by a television commercial, magazine, or newspaper advertisement. Collect magazine or newspaper ads that are eye-catching--some of the ads might be dominated by words and others by pictures that ""say it all."" Students might enjoy exploring newspapers and magazines for outstanding advertisements. Have students create magazine ads to promote their inventions. (For more advanced students, further lessons on advertising techniques would be appropriate at this point.)       3.    RECORDING A RADIO PROMO       A radio promo could be the icing on a student's advertising campaign! A promo might include facts about the usefulness of the invention, a clever jingle or song, sound effects, humor... the possibilities are endless. Students may choose to tape record their promos for use during the Invention Convention.       4. ADVERTISING ACTIVITY      Collect 5 - 6 objects and give them new uses. For instance, a toy hoop could be a waist reducer, and some strange looking kitchen gadget might be a new type of mosquito catcher. Use your imagination! Search everywhere--from the tools in the garage to the kitchen drawer--for fun objects. Divide the class into small groups, and give each group one of the objects to work with. The group is to give the object a catchy name, write a slogan, draw an ad, and record a radio promo. Stand back and watch the creative juices flow. Variation: Collect magazine ads and have the students create new advertising campaigns using a different marketing angle.       Activity #10      PARENT INVOLVEMENT     Few, if any, projects are successful unless the child    is encouraged by the parents and other caring adults. Once the children have    developed their own, original ideas, they should discuss them with their parents.    Together, they can work to make the child's idea come to life by making a model.    Although the making of a model is not necessary, it makes the project more interesting    and adds another dimension to the project. You can involve parents by simply    sending a letter home to explain the project and let them know how they may    participate. One of your parents may have invented something that they can share    with the class. (See sample parent letter on p. 45.)               Activity #11      YOUNG INVENTORS' DAY      Plan    a Young Inventors' Day so that your students can be recognized for their inventive    thinking. This day should provide opportunities for the children to display    their inventions and tell the story of how they got their idea and how it works.    They can share with other students, their parents, and others.      When a child successfully completes a task, it is important that (s)he be recognized for the effort. All children who participate in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project are winners.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has prepared a certificate    that can be copied and given to all children who participate and use       their inventive thinking skills to create an invention    or innovation. This award, signed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and    Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, is included on page 47.          Activity #12      ENRICHMENT     The following stories about great thinkers and inventors    will help to motivate your students and enhance their appreciation of the contributions    of inventors to the American way of life.      As students read these stories, they will also realize the ""inventors"" are male, female, old, young, minority, and majority. They are ordinary people who follow through with their creative ideas to make their dreams a reality.     1. GREAT THINKERS AND THEIR INVENTIONS     Earmuffs  ""Baby, Its Cold Outside"" may have been the song running through 13 year old Chester Greenwood's head one cold December day in 1873. To protect his ears while ice skating, he found a piece of wire, and with his grandmother's help, padded the ends. In the beginning, his friends laughed at him. However, when they realized that he was able to stay outside skating long after they had gone inside freezing, they stopped laughing. Instead, they began to ask Chester to make ear covers for them, too. At age 17 Chester applied for a patent. For the next 60 years, Chester's factory made earmuffs, and earmuffs made Chester rich!        BAND-AID ® At the turn of the century,    Mrs. Earl Dickson, an inexperienced cook, often burned and cut herself. Mr.    Dickson, a Johnson and Johnson employee, got plenty of practice in hand bandaging!    Out of concern for his wife's safety, he began to prepare bandages ahead of    time so that his wife could apply them by herself. By combining a piece of surgical    tape and a piece of gauze, he fashioned the first crude adhesive strip bandage!      LIFE-SAVERS ®  Candy  During the hot summer of 1913, Clarence Crane, a chocolate candy manufacturer, found himself facing a dilemma. When he tried to ship his chocolates to candy shops in other cities they melted into gooey blobs. To avoid dealing with the ""mess,"" his customers were deferring their orders until cool weather. In order to retain his customers, Mr. Crane needed to find a substitute for the melted chocolates. He experimented with hard candy which wouldn't melt during shipment. Using a machine designed for making medicine pills, Crane produced small, circular candies with a hole in the middle. The birth of LIFE SAVERS!     FRISBEE ® The    term FRISBEE did not always refer to the familiar plastic disks we visualize    flying through the air. Long ago (over 100 years ago), in Bridgeport, Connecticut,    William Russell Frisbie owned the Frisbie Pie Company and delivered his pies    locally. All of his pies were baked in the same type of 10"" round tin with a    raised edge, wide brim, six small holes in the bottom, and ""Frisbie Pies"" on    the bottom. Playing catch with the tins soon became a popular local sport. However,    the tins were slightly dangerous when a toss was missed. It became the Yale    custom to yell ""Frisbie"" when throwing a pie tin. In the 40's when plastic emerged,    the pie-tin game was recognized as a manufacturable and marketable product.    (Note: FRISBEE ®  is a registered trademark of Wham-O Mfg. Co.)      2. THOMAS EDISON AND OTHER YOUNG INVENTORS          If I were to tell you that  Thomas Alva Edison  had shown signs of inventive genius at an early age, you probably would not be surprised. Mr. Edison achieved enormous fame with his lifelong contributions of volumes of inventive technology. He received the first of his 1,093 U.S. patents by age 22. In the book,  Fire of Genius,  Ernest Heyn reported on a remarkable resourceful young Edison--though some of his earliest tinkering clearly lacked merit.     By the age of six, Thomas Edison's experiments with fire were said to have cost his father a barn. Soon after that, it is reported that young Edison tried to launch the first human balloon by persuading another youth to swallow large quantities of effervescing powders to inflate himself with gas. Of course, the experiments brought quite unexpected results!     Chemistry and electricity held great fascination for this child, Thomas Edison. By his early teens, he had designed and perfected his first real invention, an electrical cockroach control system. He glued parallel strips of tinfoil to a wall and wired the strips to the poles of a powerful battery--quite a shock for the unsuspecting insect.     As a dynamo of creativity, Mr. Edison stood as decidedly unique; but as a child with a curious, problem-solving nature, he was not alone. Here are some more ""inventive children"" we grew to know and appreciate:         At age 14, one schoolboy invented a rotary brush device to remove husks from    wheat in the flour mill run by his friend's father. The young inventor's name?    Alexander Graham Bell.           At 16, another of our junior achievers saved pennies    to buy materials for his chemistry experiments. While still a teenager, he set    his mind on developing a commercially viable aluminum refining process. By age    25, Charles Hall received a patent on his revolutionary electrolytic process.           While only 19 years old, another imaginative young    person designed and built his first helicopter. In the summer of 1909, it very    nearly flew. Years later, Igor Sikorsky perfected his design and saw his early    dreams change aviation history. Silorsky was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1987.      Scores of childhood problem-solvers abound. Perhaps you've    heard about:      *  Samuel Colt's  childhood experience with underwater explosives;     *  Fourteen-year-old  Robert Fulton's  manually operated paddlewheel; and     *  Guglielmo Marconi's  early mechanical/electrical tinkering.     Even the father of television,  Philo T. Farnsworth,  conceived his optical scanning idea at the tender age of 14.     3. GREAT WOMEN INVENTORS      Inventions tell something about the inventor's place in the society in which (s)he lives, a closeness to certain kinds of problems, and possession of certain skills. It is not surprising that up until the mid 20th Century, women's inventions were often related to childcare, housework, and healthcare, all traditional female occupations. In recent years, with access to specialized training and broader job opportunities, women are applying their creativity to many new kinds of problems, including those requiring high technology.While women have frequently come up with new ways to make their work easier, they have not always received credit for their ideas. Some stories about early women inventors show that women often recognized that they were entering ""a man's world,"" and shielded their work from the public eye by allowing men to patent their inventions.     *  Although Eli Whitney received a patent for a cotton gin,  Catherine Greene  is said to have posed both the problem and the basic idea to Whitney. Furthermore, according to Matilda Gage, ( Women as Inventor,  1883), his first model, fitted with wooden teeth, did not do the work well, and Whitney was about to throw the work aside, when Mrs. Greene proposed the substitution of wire to catch the cotton seeds.     OTHER WOMEN INVENTORS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES      * Margaret Knight,  remembered as ""the female Edison,"" received some 26 patents for such diverse items as a window frame and sash, machinery for cutting shoe soles, and improvements to internal combustion engines. Her most significant patent was for machinery that would automatically fold and glue paper bags to create square bottoms, an invention which dramatically changed shopping habits. Workmen reportedly refused her advice when first installing the equipment because, ""after all, what does a woman know about machines?""     * Sarah Breedlove    Walker,  the daughter of former slaves, was orphaned at seven and widowed    by 20. Madame Walker is credited with inventing hair lotions, creams, and an    improved hair styling hot comb. But her greatest achievement may be the development    of the Walker System, which included a broad offering of cosmetics, licensed    Walker Agents, and Walker Schools, which offered meaningful employment and personal    growth to thousands of Walker Agents, mostly Black women. Sarah Walker was the    first American woman self-made millionaire.           * Bette Graham  hoped    to be an artist, but circumstances led her into secretarial work. Bette, however,    was not an accurate typist. Fortunately, she recalled that artists could correct    their mistakes by painting over them with gesso, so she invented a quick drying    ""paint"" to cover her typing mistakes. Bette first prepared the secret formula    in her kitchen using a hand mixer, and her young son helped to pour the mixture    into little bottles. In 1980, the Liquid Paper Corporation, which Bette Graham    built, was sold for over $47 million.      * Ann Moore,  a Peace Corps volunteer, saw how African women carried babies on their backs by tying cloth around their bodies, leaving both hands free for other work. When she returned to the United States, she designed a carrier which became the popular SNUGLI. Recently Ms. Moore received another patent for a carrier to conveniently transport oxygen cylinders. People needing oxygen for breathing assistance, who were previously confined to stationary oxygen tanks, can now move about more freely. Her company now sells several versions including lightweight backpacks, handbags, shoulder bags, and wheelchair/walker carriers for portable cylinders.     * Stephanie Kwolek,     one of Dupont's leading chemists, discovered the ""miracle fiber,"" Kevlar,    which has five times the strength of steel by weight. Uses for Kevlar are seemingly    endless, including ropes and cables for oil drilling rigs, canoe hulls, boat    sails, automobile bodies and tires, and military and motorcycle helmets. Many    Viet Nam veterans and police officers are alive today because of protection    provided by bullet-proof vests made from Kevlar. Because of its strength and    lightness, Kevlar was chosen as the material for the Gossamer Albatross, a pedal    airplane flown across the English Channel. Kwolek was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.      * Gertrude B. Elion,     1988 Nobel laureate in Medicine, and Scientist Emeritus with Burroughs Wellcome    Company, is credited with the synthesis of two of the first successful drugs    for Leukemia, as well as Imuron, an agent to prevent the rejection of kidney    transplants, and Zovirax, the first selective antiviral agent against herpes    virus infections. Researchers who discovered AZT, a breakthrough treatment for    AIDS, used Elion's protocols. Elion was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1991, the first woman inductee.           Did you know      *  windshield wipers    were patented by  Mary Anderso   n  in    1903?      *  dandruff shampoo was patented by  Josie Stuart  in 1903?     *  a dishwasher was patented by  Josephine Cochrane  in 1914?     *  the first disposable diaper was patented by  Marion Donovan  in 1951?     *  a compact portable hair dryer was patented by  Harriet J. Stern  in 1962?     *  a dough product for frozen pizza was patented by  Rose Totino  in 1979?     *  the Melitta Automatic Drip Coffee Maker was patented by  Melitta Benz  in Germany in 1908?                 Note: Much of the material in this section was        drawn from the Minnesota Historical Society Exhibit, ""Her Works Praise Her,        Inventions by Women."" For further information on women inventors, you may        contact the Minnesota Historical Society's Traveling Exhibition Department        at 612/297-4497.             4. GREAT MINORITY INVENTORS      Between 1863 and 1913, approximately 1,200 inventions were patented by Black inventors. Many more were unidentified because they hid their race to avoid discrimination. Some sold their inventions to White men. The following stories are about a few of the great minority inventors.     *  Elijah McCoy.     Have you ever heard of the term ""real McCoy?"" That term may apply to a famous    Black inventor by the name of Elijah McCoy. He earned about 50 patents, but    the most famous one was for a metal or glass cup that fed oil to bearings through    a small-bore tube. Machinists and engineers who wanted genuine McCoy lubricators    may have originated the term ""the real McCoy."" Elijah McCoy was born in Ontario,    Canada, in 1843, the son of slaves who had fled Kentucky. He died in Michigan    in 1929.      *     Benjamin Banneker.  Benjamin Banneker created    the first striking clock made of wood in America. He became known as the ""Afro-American    Astronomer."" He published an almanac and with his knowledge of mathematics and    astronomy, he assisted in the surveying and planning of the new city of Washington,    D.C.       *  Granville Woods     had more than 60 patents. Known as the ""Black Edison,"" he improved Bell's    telegraph and created an electrical motor that made the underground subway possible.    He also improved the airbrake.      *  Garrett Morgan     invented the traffic signal that saved thousands of lives when the automobile    became popular. He also invented a safety hood for firefighters.      *  George Washington    Carver  changed the South with his many inventions. He discovered over 300    different products made from the peanut which, until Carver, was considered    a lowly food fit for hogs. He dedicated himself to teaching others, learning    and working with nature. He created over 125 new products with the sweet potato    and taught poor farmers how to rotate crops to i   mprove    their soil and their cotton. George Washington Carver was a great scientist    and inventor who learned to be a careful observer and who was honored throughout    the world for his creation of new things.

Copy Masters         INVENTION IDEA SURVEY        One of the best ways to collect ideas for developing    an innovation or invention is to take a survey. Make sure to survey a variety    of people of all different ages and occupations. The more people you talk to,    the more ideas you will get. The following list of questions may help you:      1. What does not work as well as you would like it to    work?      2. What job(s) would you like to see solved?      3. What problem(s) would you like to see solved?      4.

The Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project is a school activity which promotes analytical and creative thinking and problem solving. Parents can enjoy this project at home with their children by encouraging creative ideas, letting them share ideas with the family, and by assisting them with making models of their inventive ideas.     Our students will be asked to survey you, their friends, and other family members to discover a problem that needs solving. Perhaps the cap is always left off of the toothpaste or your child is always losing sneakers, pencils or mittens. Once the children find problems to solve, they will begin thinking of many ideas that might solve those problems. When they do this, they will be combining many of the skills learned in science, social studies, language, writing, art, library, math, and more.     Each student participating in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project will receive a certificate of recognition from the Assistant Secretary and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in Washington, D.C., and will share the invention with other students at our school.     Thank you for your support in this special and imaginative    adventure in learning. You will be receiving more information during the school    year.       Teacher  __________________________________   Principal  __________________________________     Certificate of Recognition for Innovative Achievement              POSITIVE COMMENTS          Presenter's Name:________________________________________      What I like most about your invention is:          ""Praise is the best diet for us, after all...""

Every time you write in the log, you should initial and date your entry and also have it signed by a witness. A witness can be anyone who knows what you are working on that day--mom, dad, friend, brother, sister, etc. The list below includes some of the items that might be recorded in your log. You will think of others. Remember, every time you work on your project or just ""think"" about your idea, you should record it in your inventor's log or notebook.

Issued by the General Court of Massachusetts, it protected    his mill for manufacturing scythes. That was the prelude to the U.S. Patent    System which has helped give birth to major industries that have transformed    the way we live.      On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the bill which laid the foundations of the modern American patent system. Since that time, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recorded and protected the electric lamp of Thomas Edison, the telephone of Alexander Graham Bell, the flying machine of the Wright Brothers, and the inventions of hundreds of thousands of other inventors.     The patent system has protected inventors by giving them an opportunity to profit from their labors, and it has benefited society by systematically recording new inventions and releasing them to the public after the inventors' limited rights have expired.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is one of the most unusual branches of the U.S. Government. Its examining staff of about 2,000 is trained in all branches of science and examines thoroughly every application to determine whether a patent may be granted--a task, in these days, involving the most exhaustive research. Not only must the examiners search United States and foreign patents to learn if a similar patent has been issued, but they must study scientific books and publications to discover whether the idea has ever been described. Previous publications, invention, or use prevents a patent being issued.     In addition to issuing patents, the Patent and Trademark Office has, since 1870, been in charge of registering trademarks, the business community's most valuable asset. More than 1,400,000 trademarks have been issued.     In its earlier days, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had on various occasions the responsibility for administering copyright matters, a task that since 1870 has been administered by the Library of Congress; collecting and publishing agricultural information; and even collecting meteorological data. For some years, it was the custodian not only of the famous old Patent Office models--the delight of every visitor to Washington for many years--but of the Declaration of Independence, and other historical documents and relics.     By publishing and distributing copies of every U.S. patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has made available to the public the world's greatest scientific and mechanical library.     Patents in Brief     A patent is a grant issued by the U.S. Government giving inventors the right to exclude all others from making, using, or selling their inventions within the United States, its territories, and possessions.     There are three kinds of patents: (1) utility patents, granted to the inventor or discoverer of any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; (2) plant patents, granted on any distinct and new variety of asexually reproduced plant; and (3) design patents, granted on any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.     Utility and plant patents are granted for a term which begins on the date of the grant and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was first filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees; design patents are granted for a term of 14 years from the date of the grant. Patents may be extended only by special act of Congress, except for some pharmaceutical patents whose terms may be extended to make up for time lost due to Government-required testing.     If you plan to file an application, you or your representative should make a search of patents previously granted to make sure that your idea has not already been patented. You may do this at the Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office, Crystal Plaza Building No. 3, 2021 South Clark Place, Arlington, Virginia. Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except holidays. More limited searches may be made at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries located throughout the country.     The patent application process can be complex, and the Patent and Trademark Office cannot assist in the preparation of application papers. We strongly advise prospective applicants to engage the services of a patent attorney or agent. Although the PTO cannot recommend any particular attorney or agent and does not control their fees, we do maintain a roster of approximately 17,000 patent attorneys and agents registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This roster is available for inspection at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents at the Government Printing Office, or on the World Wide Web (http://www.uspto.gov).     The basic fee for filing an application for patent ranges from $160 to $770, depending on the type of patent application being filed and whether or not the applicant is entitled to status as a small entity (independent inventor, small business concern, or non-profit organization). Issue fees range from $220 to $1,290. Maintenance fees are due at 3 1 Ž 2 , 7 1 Ž 2 , and 11 1 Ž 2  years from the date the patent is granted. An individual inventor can expect to pay a minimum of $4,000 for a utility patent.     Applications are assigned to examiners who are experts in various fields of technology. The invention must be new, useful, and unobvious to those in that particular field of study. This procedure normally takes about 19 months.     Disclosure Document Program     Under its Disclosure Document Program, the PTO accepts and preserves for a two-year period papers disclosing an invention pending the filing of an application for patent. This disclosure is accepted as evidence of the dates of conception of the invention, but provides no patent protection nor should it be considered a ""grace period"" during which the inventor can wait to file a patent application without possible loss of benefits. A fee of $10 is charged for this service.     Provisional Patent Application     A provisional application establishes a filing date but does not begin the examination process. It provides the inventor with a one-year period to further develop the invention, determine marketability, acquire funding or capital, or seek licensing agreements. To obtain a patent, the inventor must file a nonprovisional application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. The fee is $150 or $75 for a small entity.     Trademarks in Brief     A trademark (or brand name or logo) is a word, name, symbol, design, combination of word and design or slogan used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its goods or services and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. When it is used for services, it can be called a service mark.     Trademark rights come from using the mark, and marks are protected under common law from the time they are first used. While there is no requirement to do so, owners of marks who have used them or have a bona fide intention to use them in Federally regulated commerce may register them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This provides the owners with certain procedural and legal advantages. For intent-to-use applications, actual use of the mark in commerce is a prerequisite to the ultimate issuance of a registration.     Many trademark owners use a  ™  (trademark) or  SM  (service mark) symbol with their mark to indicate that they are claiming rights in it. The  ®  symbol may only be used if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Federal registration. To register a mark, the owner must file an application consisting of a written statement in which the owner indicates among other things the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used and the date of first use of the mark in commerce; a drawing of the mark; five specimens showing the mark as it is actually used (labels, tags, packaging, etc.); and the required filing fee of $245 per class.     Each application is reviewed by an examining attorney to determine if the mark is eligible for registration and is compared with other marks to determine if it is likely to cause confusion with those already registered. If a proposed mark passes the examination, it is then published in the  Official Gazette  of the Patent and Trademark Office. Those who believe they will be damaged by registration of the mark then have an opportunity to oppose registration. If no opposition is filed, a registration certificate is issued or a notice of allowance is issued to the applicant in an intent-to-use application. Within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file specimens evidencing use of the mark in commerce, a fee of $100, and a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce before a registration certificate is issued. The registration may be renewed every 10 years as long as the registrant is still using the mark.     Note: Fees mentioned above represent only the minimum required for a patent or trademark application. Additional fees may be due during the prosecution of an application. Fees are current as of October 1996. Fee increases, when necessary, usually take effect on October 1 of any given year. For a complete list of fees or further information, write to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Center for Patent and Trademark Information, Washington, DC 20231, or call 800-786-9199 or 703-308-HELP(4357).      Copyrights in Brief     The seeds of copyright protection were sown in Gutenberg's development of the printing press that ultimately led to the first printed copyright statute, the English Statute of Anne. Both the printing press and the concept of copyright protection followed the colonists to the new world. The state legislature of 12 of the first states passed copyright laws before Congress enacted the first Federal law. On may 31, 1790, Congress used the power given it in Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to ""promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries"" and enacted the first Federal Copyright Act.      Noah Webster, the compiler of both the first American speller and an early dictionary, played a major role in getting both the state laws and the first Federal statute enacted. He traveled to each legislature and described the authors' plight and their need for copyright protection. Authors have continued to guard the rights granted by the Constitution and to ensure that new technologies permitting copying do not erode these rights.     What is copyright and when does copyright protection arise?  Federal copyright legislation gives an author certain exclusive rights for a limited time: the right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords, to perform the work publicly, and to display the work publicly. Congress attempts to create a balance between the rights given to authors and the legitimate needs for society. There are some limitations or exemptions that permit society to make specific uses of copyrighted works.     Copyright subsists in an original work of authorship from the time the work is first created or fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated. A work is put in a tangible form, for example, when a literary work is typed or written or a piece of music captured on tape.     Copyright covers the expression of ideas and not the idea itself. Thus, copyright does not cover ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery..."" It does not, for example, protect blank checks, standardized material, titles, or government works.     What does copyright protection mean for an author?  Copyright means that no one may appropriate the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display a work without permission from the author unless the right has been transferred to the user or the person who authorizes or licenses this particular use, or an exemption covers the use in question.      What works does copyright protect?  The first law protected maps, charts, and books for a basic term of 14 years; since 1790 the copyright law has evolved to include musical works, dramatic works, photographs, paintings, and other works of art, motion pictures, and sound recordings.     Literary works:  Copyright protects literary works of all types from novels such as  Gone With the Wind  or  The Catcher in the Rye,  to text books and other fact-based accounts, including newspapers. Although copyright covers the expression in non-fiction works, it does not cover the facts themselves. They are uncopyrightable and can be freely used by anyone. Copyright in the literary works also covers printed speeches such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""I have a dream"" speech. Today, even computer programs are protected as literary works.     Musical works:  Copyright covers all kinds of music from the songs performed on the radio to the music in television commercials and MTV.     Dramatic works:  Copyright covers every kind of permanently fixed dramatic work from senior plays such as Our Town performed by high schools, to such current Broadway blockbusters as Phantom of the Opera, M. Butterfly, or the latest Neil Simon offering. It covers those plays written especially for the theater like Arthur Miller's classic Death of a Salesman and also those based on other popular works like the adaptation of Kafka's short story Metamorphosis.     Pantomimes and choreographic works:  Copyright protects dance sequences in stage shows like Chorus Line or Cats if they are in tangible form.     Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:  Works created by sculptors, photographers, painters, and other graphic artists are protected by copyright. The works covered include not only paintings, photographs, and sculptures, but also advertisements, the artwork on game boards, and the artwork on fabrics or textiles.     Motion pictures and other audiovisual works:  Classics like The Wizard of Oz or the latest Steven Spielberg or Woody Allen film are protectible, as are television programs and ideograms, including the once very popular Pac Man and the currently popular Nintendo games.     Sound recordings:  The copyright law was amended in 1971 to include sound recordings. Copyright now protects the latest recording of your favorite artists in any format--disk (be it 45, 33, or compact disk), tape, or cassette. The copyright authorship protected in a sound recording is two-fold: it covers the contribution of both the performer and the record producer responsible for the recording.     How long is a work protected?  As noted earlier, the 1790 act provided a 14 year term. Mark Twain was one of the authors who persuaded Congress that the term should be longer. In 1909 the term was extended to protect authors for a 28 year term plus a possibility of 28 more years if the author renewed his or her claim in a timely fashion. Then in 1976 the term was extended again to its current length: the life of the author plus 50 years. Special rules apply to works created by employees as part of their jobs such as motion pictures and anonymous or pseudonymous works.     When the term of the protection expires on a particular work, it may be used freely by anyone.     Where is the work protected?  A work copyrighted in the United States is protected here as well as in all of the other countries with whom we have copyright relations by our membership in the two multilateral copyright treaties--the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, by presidential proclamation, or bilateral relations. The United States has copyright relations with over 100 countries.     Note: The filing fee for each application is $20.   The Copyright Office has the authority to adjust fees at five-year intervals.

More than a toy.   selected    toy patents.   5. Rumor has it... that a patent office official    resigned because ""everything that can be invented has been invented.""                  The First Patent Grant in the    United States       The patent grant you see reproduced on the next page    was the first one issued by the United States, to Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford,    Vermont in 1790. Two other patents were granted that year: one for a special    process of making candles and one for improved flour milling machinery. The    Hopkins patent was for an ""Improvement, not known before such Discovery, in    the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new apparatus and Process"", and was    granted for a term of fourteen years.      The name potash refers to several potassium salts, mild    alkalis, which were derived from the ashes of timber or other plants. It was    also known in a caustic form when mixed with lime. In reacting with fats or    oils, potash produced a soft soap. It was an essential ingredient in the manufacture    of glass, alum (salts of aluminum--used chiefly in medicine), and saltpetre    (an important ingredient in gun powder). Potash also played an important role    in bleaching, mining, metallurgy, and other industrial interests. Its many applications    served as an indication of the emerging chemical industry in the nineteenth    century.      In the summer of 1956, the Vermont Historic Sites Commission    erected a marker at the former residence of Samuel Hopkins. The original patent    granted to him still exists in the collections of the Chicago Historical Society.                            Abraham Lincoln is the only U.S. president to receive a    patent. Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois in 1849 when he was issued Patent    No. 6,469 for a ""manner of buoying vessels.""      As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise    down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. The boat slid onto    a dam and was dislodged only after heroic efforts. A few years later, while    crossing the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. These two similar    experiences led him to invent a solution to the problem.      The invention consists of a set of bellows attached to    the hull of a ship just below the water line. When a vessel is in danger of    getting stuck in shallow water, the bellows are filled with air, and the vessel,    thus buoyed, floats clear of the obstacle.      Although Lincoln probably never profited from his invention,    he was a strong supporter of the patent system, saying that the patent system    ""added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production    of new and useful things.""            ""Well    informed people know it is impossible to transmit the voice over wires, and    that, were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value.""    Boston Post editorial, 1865        Perhaps the most famous of all design patents    is the Statue of Liberty.            Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Alva Edison didn't    ""invent"" the light bulb, but rather he improved upon a 50-year-old idea. In    1879, using lower current, a small carbonized filament, and an improved vacuum    inside the globe, he was able to produce a reliable, long-lasting source of    light. Perhaps more importantly, Edison's invention led to an industry to distribute    electric power creating jobs for many Americans.      Edison was granted his first patent on June 1, 1869,    and averaged one patent application every 11 days between 1869 and 1910. America's    most prolific inventor received 1,093 patents--more than any other person before    or since. While he reveled in and profited from his successes, he lived with    failure every day.       ""Results? Why man, I've gotten a lot of results. I know    several thousand things that won't work.""       Thomas Alva Edison, 1900      In 1973, Edison was the first inventor inducted into    the National Inventors Hall of Fame.            Lewis    Howard Latimer was employed by a Patent Solicitor where he began the study of    drafting. His talent for drafting and his creative genius led him to invent    a method of making carbon filaments for the electric incandescent lamp. Latimer    was the original draftsman for Thomas Edison and the star witness in suits which    infringed upon Edison's patents.                ""Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.""    Lord Kelving, President, Royal Society, c. 1895                         Famous magician Harry Houdini {born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest,    Hungary in 1874} was also an inventor. Houdini began his career as a trapeze    artist and was later renowned as a magician and an escape artist. He astonished    audiences by escaping from handcuffs, straitjackets, and prison cells. Houdini's    invention for a ""diver's suit"" permits divers, in case of danger, to quickly    divest themselves of the suit while submerged and to safely escape and reach    the surface of the water.      In his later years, Houdini put his extensive knowledge    of the occult and magic to public benefit by exposing the tricks of fraudulent    spiritualistic mediums. Houdini left his entire library of magic to the U.S.    Library of Congress.                     ""When you can do the common things in life    in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world."" George Washington    Carver         Since 1930, plants have been patentable.    The first plant patent was granted to Henry F. Bosenberg for a climbing or trailing    rose.        An    Wang was born in Shanghai, China. He immigrated to the United States in 1945    and received his Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University in 1948. He    founded Wang Laboratories in 1951 to develop specialty electronic devices. Dr.    Wang is responsible for the original development of the basic components and    systems of digital computing machines. He held more than 35 patents, revolutionizing    the information processing industry. Dr. Wang was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988.           Phillip J. Stevens holds several patents for innovative    concepts in weaponry. He directed the Minuteman III Weapon System at TRW, Inc.,    and founded Ultrasystems, Inc., a high-technology business enterprise. A former    director of the United Indian Development Association, he received multiple    awards for leadership, innovation, and support of the Native American people.      Stevens with co-inventor, Larry E. Hughes, invented a    new nozzle to control delivery of propellants from rocket motors. The new variable    area throat nozzle was simple in construction, light in weight, efficient in    operation, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.                   Ysidro M. Martinez' invention of a below-the-knee prosthesis    avoids some of the problems associated with conventional artificial limbs. Martinez,    an amputee himself, took a theoretical approach in his design. He does not attempt    to replicate the natural limb with articulated joints in the ankle or foot which    is seen by Martinez as causing poor gait. His prosthesis has a high center of    mass and is light in weight to facilitate acceleration and deceleration and    reduce friction. The foot is considerably shorter to control acceleration forces,    reducing the friction and pressure.                The mouse that went to Harvard... was the    first animal to be patented in the United States. In the 1980s, Philip Leder    devised a method of introducing specific oncogenes (genes with the potential    to cause other cells to become cancerous) into mice. The transgenic non-human    eukaryotic animal is bred to contract breast cancer for medial research to facilitate    carcinogen testing and development of cancer therapies. As you can imagine,    the patenting of living organisms (nonhuman) has generated controversy and a    lot of public debate on the ethical, religious, economic, and regulatory issues    arising from their use.      More than a toy...       Everyone has a favorite toy--a cuddly bear, a rugged    truck, a special game. But how many of us connect that toy with a multi-billion    dollar industry that thrives on innovation?      America's toy manufacturers and retailers depend heavily    on intellectual property protection. Toy inventors use both utility and design    patents, along with trademarks and copyrights to prevent others from copying    or profiting from their inventions or their trade names. In fact, many toys--especially    video games--take advantage of all three types of intellectual property protection.      Americans did not enter the toy ""business"" until the    1830's, when steamboats and steam trains improved the transportation and distribution    of manufactured goods. Early toymakers used wood, tin, or cast iron to fashion    horses, soldiers, wagons, and other simple toys. Charles Goodyear's method for    ""vulcanizing"" rubber created another medium for manufacturing balls, dolls,    and squeeze toys.      Toys Turn On!       In the early 1970's, Pong, the first patented video game,    hit the market. Nolan Bushnell created it along with a company named Atari.    Pong debuted in arcades, and soon moved on to television screens in living rooms    around the world. Other games followed--Space Invaders, Pac Man, and Tron. As    technology advanced, the dedicated single game machine was replaced by programmable    machines that allowed different games to be played simply by exchanging a cartridge.      Inventions in circuitry and miniaturization in the early    1980's produced handheld games, as Nintendo, a Japanese electronics company,    along with many others, moved into the video game market. As home computers    become more accessible, video games become more versatile, action packed, challenging,    and diverse.      As society has progressed, so has the complexity and    diversity of our amusements. Once, toys simply reflected everyday life and activities.    Today, toys create new ways of living, teach us to adapt to changing technologies,    and inspire us to follow our dreams.      The    Ups and Downs of Yo-Yo's       The Yo-Yo, a weapon used in South Pacific cultures, has    been traced back to the ancient Greeks. First patented in 1866 by James L. Haven    and Charles Hettrich, the Yo-Yo has enjoyed periods of popularity for generations    with kids from 1 - 100.      Donald Duncan was the marketing genius responsible for    the first American Yo-Yo fad of the 1930's. He also invented the Eskimo Pie,    originated the Good Humor Ice Cream truck, and successfully marketed the first    parking meter. At one time, Lego Co. used unsold Yo-Yo's as wheels on toy trucks.    In 1962, the most recent period of popularity, Duncan sold 45 million of the    toy.                                                      Rumor has it...       that a Patent Office official resigned and recommended    that the Patent Office be closed because he thought that everything that could    possibly be invented had already been invented!      While that statement makes good fun of predictions that    do not come to pass, it is none the less just a myth. Researchers have found    no evidence that any official or employee of the U.S. Patent Office had ever    resigned because there was nothing left to invent. A clue to the origin of the    myth may be found in Patent Office Commissioner Henry Ellsworth's 1843 report    to Congress. In it he states, ""The advancement of the arts, from year to year,    taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human    improvement must end."" But Commissioner Ellsworth was simply using a bit of    rhetorical flourish to emphasize the growing number of patents as presented    in the rest of the report. He even outlined specific areas in which he expected    patent activity to increase in the future.       Taken out of context, such remarks take on a life of    their own and are perpetuated in publication after publication whose authors,    rather than check facts, copy and quote each other. For example, recent publications    have attributed the ""everything that has been invented..."" quote to a later    commissioner, Charles H. Duell, who held that office in 1899. Unlike Ellsworth,    who may have been merely misquoted, there is absolutely no basis to support    Duell's alleged statement. Just the opposite is true. Duell's 1899 report documents    an increase of about 3,000 patents over the previous year, and nearly 60 times    the number granted in 1837. Further, Duell quotes President McKinley's annual    message saying, ""Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability    to equal, if not surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science,    industry and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful    aids to the accomplishment of such a result."" Duell adds, ""May not our inventors    hopefully look to the Fifty-sixth Congress for aid and effectual encouragement    in improving the American patent system?"" These are unlikely words of someone    who thinks that everything has been invented.      References:      Jeffery, Dr. Eber.  Journal of the Patent Office Society.     July 1940      Sass, Samuel.

Updated 3/28/03                         Travel          records         The Travel Office has just completed an audit conducted by the Inspector          General (IG) and some discrepancies in the record-keeping practices for          domestic travel records have surfaced. Because of these discrepancies,          the process for keeping domestic travel records in the group/division          offices has changed.          The Travel Office requires that copies of the following be sent to the          Travel Office with the actual travel requests/approvals/receipts, etc.,          to avoid inconsistent record-keeping practices throughout the Laboratory.                           1. Copies of justifications for any charges that are above the allowed          government rates, i.e., lodging, etc.          2. Hard copy signature approvals by a manager of any travel if the manager          does not approve on-line, i.e., if manager has delegated on-line approvals          a hard copy signature from the manager is required.           3. Approved copies of any exceptions to the travel policy.         If these copies are not sent to the Travel Office, group/division offices          are required to schedule these records under ADM 9/1.a., Commercial Freight          and Passenger Transportation Files, and must cut off these records at          the end of the fiscal year and retain them for six years. These records          must be kept as long as the Travel Office is required to keep the official          domestic travel records. When retention periods have been met, a request          for approval to destroy must be sent to IM-5 on a Certificate of Records          Destruction, Form 1704.          When group/division offices keep copies of domestic travel records submitted          to the Travel Office, these will remain scheduled under the ADM 23/1,          Office Administrative Files, and need to be cut off at the end of the          fiscal year and retained for two years. When retention periods have been          met, a request for approval to destroy must be sent to IM-5 on a Certificate          of Records Destruction, Form 1704.

The topic for this seminar will be ""Exploring, Discovery and Admissibility          of Electronic Records: A Trial Lawyer's Perspective."" The seminar          speaker will be John J. Isaza, an independent senior consultant responsible          for the Legal and Regulatory Information Services Division of Records          Improvement Institute LLC, of Laguna Beach, Calif. Isaza will discuss          the particular challenges that judges, lawyers and companies face in having          particular types of documents discovered and then admitted in court, including          e-mails, word, excel or power point documents, imaged documents and enterprise          planning systems.          The cost for the seminar will be $75 for ARMA members and $125 for non-ARMA          members. Refreshment and lunch will be included.

The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).

As a result of that effort,    Project XL was initiated in 1985 as a national partnership designed to encourage    proliferation of such programs and to develop new programs and materials which    will promote critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills for all    children in our Nation's schools.      The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT is one of the many projects included in this national outreach program. It should be used in conjunction with a thinking skills program as a means of applying critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills through the activity of creating an innovation or invention.     When a student is asked to ""invent"" a solution to a problem, the student must draw upon previous knowledge, skills, and experience. The student also recognizes areas where new learnings must be acquired in order to understand or address the problem. This information must then be applied, analyzed, synthesized, and evaluated. Through critical and creative thinking and problem-solving, ideas become reality as children create inventive solutions, illustrate their ideas, and make models of their inventions. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides children with opportunities to develop and practice higher-order thinking skills.     Throughout the years, many thinking skills models and programs have been generated from among America's finest educators, seeking to describe the essential elements of thinking and/or to develop a systematic approach to teaching thinking skills as part of the school curricula. Three such models/descriptions are illustrated in this introduction. Although each uses different terminology, each model describes similar elements of either critical or creative thinking, or both. A review of the models of BLOOM, TAYLOR, and ISAKSEN and TREFFINGER show how the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides an opportunity for students to ""experience"" most of the elements described in these models.       Benjamin Bloom's Model        Perhaps most familiar to educators is ""BLOOM'S taxonomy."" Bloom describes the major areas in the cognitive domain. This information is drawn from the  Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Handbook 1: Cognitive Domain  (1956). The taxonomy begins by defining KNOWLEDGE as the remembering of previously learned material. Knowledge, according to Bloom, represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain. Knowledge is followed by COMPREHENSION, the ability to grasp the meaning of material and goes just beyond the knowledge level. Comprehension is the lowest level of understanding. APPLICATION is the next area in the hierarchy and refers to the ability to use learned material in new and concrete principles and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than comprehension.     In    ANALYSIS, the next area of the taxonomy, the learning outcomes require an understanding    of both the content and the structural form of material. Next is SYNTHESIS,    which refers to the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. Learning    outcomes at this level stress creative behaviors with a major emphasis on the    formulation of new patterns or structures. The last level of the taxonomy is    EVALUATION. Evaluation is concerned with the ability to judge the value of material    for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria. Learning    outcome s in this area are the highest in the cognitive    hierarchy because they incorporate or contain elements of knowledge, comprehension,    application, analysis, and synthesis. In addition, they contain conscious value    judgments based on clearly defined criteria. The activity of inventing encourages    the four highest levels of learning--application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation--in    addition to knowledge and comprehension.        Calvin Taylor's Model -- Talents    Unlimited      The second model is introduced by Calvin Taylor in Chapter XI and is discussed in a summary chapter by Carol Schlichter in Joseph Renzulli's book entitled  Systems and Models for Developing Programs for the Gifted and Talented  (1986). The Taylor model describes the talent areas as PRODUCTIVE THINKING, COMMUNICATION, PLANNING, DECISION MAKING, and FORECASTING. This work is best known as TALENTS UNLIMITED, a program of the National Diffusion Network of the U.S. Department of Education. The Taylor model incorporates both the critical and creative elements of thinking. Rather than a taxonomy, this is a thinking skills model that describes the essential elements of thinking, beginning with the academic talent and then incorporating the other talent areas, as described in more detail below.     PRODUCTIVE THINKING promotes creative thinking in the    Taylor model. It suggests thinking of many ideas, varied ideas, unusual ideas,    and adding to those ideas.        COMMUNICATION has six elements which include:      *  give many, varied, single words to describe something;     *  give many, varied, single words to describe feelings;     *  think of many, varied things that are like another thing in a special way;     *  let others know that you understand how they feel;     *  make a network of ideas using many, varied and complete thoughts;     *  tell your feelings and needs without using words.     PLANNING requires that students learn to tell:     *  what they are going to plan;     *  the materials that they will need;     *  the steps that they will need to accomplish the task; and     *  the problems that might occur.     DECISION MAKING teaches the student to:     *  think of the many, varied things that could be done;     *  think more carefully about each alternative;     *  choose one alternative that they think is best; and     *  give many, varied reasons for the choice.     FORECASTING is the last of the five talents and requires students to make many, varied predictions about a situation, examining cause and effect relationships. Every element of the TAYLOR model is used when a child invents.     Creative Problem Solving Model      The third model developed by Scott Isaksen and Donald Treffinger as described in the book  Creative Problem Solving: The Basic Course  (1985) by Isaksen and Treffinger and published in Buffalo, New York, by Bearly Limited, also describes both critical and creative thinking. CREATIVE THINKING is described as making and communicating connections to: think of many possibilities; think and experience in various ways and use different points of view; think of new and unusual possibilities; and guide in generating and selecting alternatives. CRITICAL THINKING is described as analyzing and developing possibilities to: compare and contrast many ideas; improve and refine ideas; make effective decisions and judgments; and provide a sound foundation for effective action. These definitions are used in a six-stage, problem-solving process. A brief description of each of the six stages follows:     1. Mess Finding:  Just what's the mess that needs cleaning up, the situation that demands our attention? We have to identify and acknowledge this first before we can proceed.     2. Data Finding:  Once the general mess is defined, the next stage involves ""taking stock""--unearthing and collecting information, knowledge, facts, feelings, opinions, and thoughts to sort out and clarify your mess more specifically. What do you know about the situation, and what do you still need to know?     3. Problem Finding:  Now that your data is collected, you need to formulate a ""problem statement"" that expresses the ""heart"" of the situation. You must try to put aside the common assumption that you ""already know what the problem is"" and try to state the problem in such a manner as to invite novel perspectives on it.     4. Idea Finding:  This is the state in which you brainstorm as many ideas or alternatives as possible for dealing with your problem statement. Don't evaluate your ideas at this point, merely list them as an idea pool from which you'll draw in putting together a variety of solutions to your problem.      5. Solution Finding:  Now that you have a number of ideas that can serve as possible solutions to your problem, it's time to evaluate them systematically. To do this you have to generate a variety of criteria and select the most important for your problem. Is it cost? expediency? pleasure? time involvement? etc. In this way, you'll be able to identify and evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of possible solutions.     6. Acceptance Finding:  Having decided upon a solution, it's time to formulate a plan of action to implement your solution. Determine what kind of help you'll need, what obstacles or difficulties might get in the way, and what specific short- and long-term steps you are going to take to rid yourself of that original mess!     Now that you have reviewed these examples, you will see    the critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills and talents that    can be applied through the activity of inventing. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM    PROJECT that follows can be used across all disciplines and grade levels and    with         all children. It can be integrated with all curricular    areas and used as a means of applying the concepts or elements of any thinking    skills program that may be in use in your school district. Participation in    this project will provide your students with an excellent opportunity to experience    the highest levels of thinking. Activities can be adapted to the developmental    and academic needs of the class.      We hope that you will join Project XL in this national effort, by developing your own program for promoting the teaching of inventive thinking and problem-solving skills. Use the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT as a springboard for capturing the imagination, interest, and creativity that each of us has within our reach. The children of this Nation are our very best investment in tomorrow. Our future will be brighter if we add a big ""T"" for thinking to the basic 3 ""Rs"" of the school curricula.     A special project that provides a unique opportunity for children of all ages to develop their problem-solving and inventive thinking skills in an integrated learning activity can be implemented at your school. Just use the procedures, activities, and guidelines in this booklet to create your own exciting program.     Children of all ages are talented and creative. This project will give them an opportunity to develop their creative potential and synthesize and apply knowledge and skills by creating an invention or innovation to solve a problem, just as a ""real"" inventor would.              ACTIVITIES              Activity #1      INTRODUCING INVENTIVE THINKING      ""Imagination is more important than knowledge, for    imagination embraces the world.""     Albert Einstein      1. Read the stories  in the back of this guide    (p. 27)or copy them for the students to read themselves. Ask students, ""How    did these inventors get their ideas? How did they make their ideas a reality?""    Locate books in your library about inventors, invention, and creativity. Older    students can locate these references themselves.      2. Invite a local inventor  to speak to the class.    Since local inventors are not usually listed in the phone book, you can find    them by calling a local patent attorney or your local intellectual property    law association. Your community may also have a Patent and Trademark Depository    Library or an inventor's society that you may contact. If not, most of your    major companies have a research and development department made up of people    who think inventively for a living.      3. Next, ask the students to look  at the things    in the classroom that are inventions. All the inventions in the classroom that    have a U.S. patent will have a patent number. One such item is probably the    pencil sharpener. Tell them to check out their house for patented items. Let    the students list all of the inventions they discover. What would improve these    inventions?      4. In order to guide your students  through the    inventive process, a few preliminary lessons dealing with creative thinking    will help set the mood. Begin with a brief explanation of brainstorming and    a discussion on the rules of brainstorming (see p. 10).      Brainstorming      Brainstorming is a process of spontaneous thinking used by an individual or by a group of people to generate numerous alternative ideas while deferring judgment. Introduced by Alex Osborn in his book  Applied Imagination,  brainstorming is the crux of each of the stages of all problem-solving methods.     RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING          NO    CRITICISM ALLOWED.  People tend to automatically evaluate each suggested    idea--their own as well as others. Both internal and external criticism are    to be avoided while brainstorming. Neither positive nor negative comments are    allowed. Either type inhibits the free flow of thought and requires time which    interferes with the next rule. Write each spoken idea down as it is given and    move on.           WORK FOR QUANTITY.  Alex Osborn stated that ""Quantity    breeds quality."" People must experience a ""braindrain"" (get all the common responses    out of the way) before the innovative, creative ideas can surface; therefore,    the more ideas, the more likely they are to be quality ideas.           HITCHHIKING WELCOME.  Hitchhiking occurs when one    member's idea produces a similar idea or an enhanced idea in another member.    All ideas should be recorded.           FREEWHEELING ENCOURAGED.  Outrageous, humorous, and    seemingly unimportant ideas should be recorded. It is not uncommon for the most    off-the-wall comment to be one wherein lies the solution for the problem.        Activity #2      PRACTICING THE CREATIVE PART        OF INVENTIVE THINKING     1. Cultivate the following creative thinking processes    described by Paul Torrance and discussed in  The Search for Satori and Creativity     (1979).          FLUENCY the production of a great number of ideas.            FLEXIBILITY the production of ideas or products that    show a variety of possibilities or realms of thought.            ORIGINALITY the production of ideas that are unique    or unusual.          ELABORATION the production of ideas that display intensive detail or enrichment.      For    practice in elaboration, have pairs or small groups of students choose a particular    idea from the brainstorming list and add the flourishes and details that would    develop the idea more fully.      Allow the students to share their innovative and inventive ideas!       2. Once your students have become familiar with the rules    of brainstorming and the creative thinking processes, Bob Eberle's SCAMPER technique    for brainstorming could be introduced.      S UBSTITUTE What else instead? Who else instead? Other ingredients? Other material? Other power? Other place?     C OMBINE How about a blend, an alloy, an ensemble? Combine purposes? Combine appeals?     A DAPT What else is like this? What other idea does this suggest? Does past offer parallel? What could I copy?     M INIFY Order, form, shape? What to add? More time?     M AGNIFY Greater frequency? Higher? Longer? Thicker?     P UT TO OTHER USES New ways to use as is? Other uses I modified? Other places to use? Other people to reach?     E LIMINATE What to subtract? Smaller? Condensed? Miniature? Lower? Shorter? Lighter? Omit? Streamline? Understate?     R EVERSE Interchange components? Other pattern?     R EARRANGE Other layout? Other sequence? Transpose cause and effect? Change pace? Transpose positive and negative? How about opposites? Turn it backward? Turn it upside-down? Reverse roles?     3. Bring in any object or use objects around the classroom to do the following exercise. Ask the students to list many new uses for a familiar object by using the SCAMPER technique with regard to the object. You could use a paper plate to begin with, and see how many new things the students will discover. Make sure to follow the rules for brainstorming in Activity #1.     4. Using literature, ask your students to create a new    ending to a story, change a character or situation within a story, or create    a new beginning for the story that would result in the same ending.      5. Put a list of objects on the chalkboard. Ask your    students to combine them in different ways to create a new product.      Let the students make their own list of objects. Once    they combine several of them, ask them to illustrate the new product and explain    why it might be useful.            Activity #3      PRACTICING INVENTIVE THINKING    WITH THE CLASS     Before your students begin to find their own problems    and create unique inventions or innovations to solve them, you can assist them    by taking them through some of the steps as a group.      1. Finding the Problem.  Let the class list problems in their own classroom that need solving. Use the ""brainstorming"" technique from Activity #1. Perhaps your students never have a pencil ready, as it is either missing or broken when it is time to do an assignment. Select one problem for the class to solve using the following steps:      a. Find several problems. Select one to work on.      b. Analyze the situation.      c. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem.     List the possibilities. Be sure to allow even the silliest possible solution, as creative thinking must have a positive, accepting environment in order to flourish.       2. Finding a Solution.       a. Select one or more possible solutions to work on. You may want to divide into groups if the class elects to work on several of the ideas.      b. Improve and refine the idea(s).      c. Share the class or individual solution(s)/invention(s) for solving the class problem.     Solving a ""class"" problem and creating a ""class"" invention    will help students learn the process and make it easier for them to work on    their own invention projects.              Activity #4      DEVELOPING AN INVENTION IDEA        Now that your students have had an introduction to the inventive process, it is time for them to find a problem and create their own invention to solve it.     1. Begin by asking your students to conduct a survey. Tell them to interview everyone that they can think of to find out what problems need solutions. What kind of invention, tool, game, device, or idea would be helpful at home, work, or during leisure time? (see p. 39)     2. Ask the students to list the problems that need to be solved.     3. Next comes the decision-making process. Using the list of problems, ask the students to think of which problems would be possible for them to work on. They can do this by listing the pros and cons for each possibility. Predict the outcome or possible solution(s) for each problem. Make a decision by selecting one or two problems that provide the best options for an inventive solution. (Duplicate the Planning and Decision-Making Framework p. 41)     4. Begin an Inventor's Log or Journal. A record of your ideas and work will help you develop your invention and protect it when completed. (Sample log sheet on p. 51.)          RULES FOR AUTHENTIC     JOURNAL KEEPING      *  Using a bound    notebook, make notes each day about the things you do and learn while working    on your invention.      *  Record your    idea and how you got it.      *  Write about    problems you have and how you solve them.      *  Write in ink    and do not erase.      *  Add sketches    and drawings to make things clear.      *  List all parts,    sources, and costs of materials.      *  Sign and date    all entries at the time they are made and have them witnessed.             5. To illustrate why record-keeping is important, read the following story about Daniel Drawbaugh who said that he invented the telephone, but didn't have one single paper or record to prove it.        Long before Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application in 1875, Daniel Drawbaugh claimed to have invented the telephone. But since he had no journal or record, the Supreme Court rejected his claims by four votes to three. Alexander Graham Bell had excellent records and was awarded the patent for the telephone.     Activity #5      BRAINSTORMING FOR CREATIVE    SOLUTIONS           Now that the students have one or two problems to work on, they must take the same steps that they did in solving the class problem in Activity #3. These steps could be listed on the chalkboard or a chart.     1. Analyze the problem(s). Select one to work on.     2. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem. List all of the possibilities. Be non-judgmental. (See Brainstorming in Activity #1 and SCAMPER in Activity #2.)     3. Select one or more possible solutions to work on.     4. Improve and refine your ideas.     Now that your students have some exciting possibilities    for their invention projects, they will need to use their critical thinking    skills to narrow down the possible solutions. They can do this by asking themselves    the following questions about their inventive idea:      Activity #6      PRACTICING THE CRITICAL PARTS    OF     INVENTIVE THINKING            1. Is my idea practical?     2. Can it be made easily?     3. Is it as simple as possible?     4. Is it safe?     5. Will it cost too much to make or use?     6. Is my idea really new?     7. Will it withstand use, or will it break easily?     8. Is my idea similar to something else?     9. Will people really use my invention? (Survey your classmates or the people in your neighborhood to document the need or usefulness of your idea.)       Activity #7      COMPLETING THE INVENTION      When students have an idea that meets most of the above    qualifications, they need to plan how they are going to complete their project.    The following planning technique will save them a great deal of time and effort:      1. Identify the problem and possible solution. Give your invention a name.     2. List the materials needed to illustrate your invention and to make a model of it. You will need paper, pencil, and crayons or markers to draw your invention. You might use cardboard, paper, clay, wood, plastic, yarn, paper clips, and so forth to make a model. You might also want to use an art book or a book on model-making from your school library.     3. List, in order, the steps for completing your invention.     4. Think of the possible problems that might occur. How would you solve them?     5. Complete your invention. Ask your parents and teacher    to help with the model.                                     REMEMBER!            * WHAT  -          describe the problem            * MATERIALS           - list the materials needed            * STEPS  -          list the steps to complete your invention            * PROBLEMS           - predict the problems that could occur.                           Activity #8      NAMING THE INVENTION        An invention can be named in one of the    following ways:    1. Using the inventor'sBraille name          Levi Strauss = LEVI'S ®  jeans            Louis Braille = Alphabet System           2. Using the components or ingredients of the invention           Root Beer         Peanut Butter                  3. With initials or acronyms          IBM ®         S.C.U.B.A. ®           4. Using word combinations (notice repeated consonant sounds and rhyming words).           KIT KAT ®         HULA HOOP ®        PUDDING POPS ®           CAP'N CRUNCH ®           5. Using the product's function           SUPERSEAL ®          DUSTBUSTER ®          vacuum cleaner           hairbrush           earmuffs           Activity #9      OPTIONAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES      Students can be very fluent when it comes to listing ingenious    names of products out on the market. Solicit their suggestions and have them    explain what makes each name effective. Each student should generate names for    his/her own invention.        1. Developing a slogan or jingle      Have the students define the terms ""slogan"" and ""jingle."" Discuss the purpose of   having a slogan.               Sample slogans and jingles:      ""Things go better with Coke.""   ""COKE IS IT! ® ""   ""TRIX ARE FOR KIDS ® ""   ""OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-ELEVEN ® ""   ""TWOALLBEEFPATTIES...""   ""GE: WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE! ® ""      Your students will be able to recall many slogans and jingles! When a slogan is named, discuss the reasons for its effectiveness. Allow time for thought in which the students can create jingles for their inventions.       2. CREATING AN ADVERTISEMENT         For a crash course in advertising, discuss the visual effect created by a television commercial, magazine, or newspaper advertisement. Collect magazine or newspaper ads that are eye-catching--some of the ads might be dominated by words and others by pictures that ""say it all."" Students might enjoy exploring newspapers and magazines for outstanding advertisements. Have students create magazine ads to promote their inventions. (For more advanced students, further lessons on advertising techniques would be appropriate at this point.)       3.    RECORDING A RADIO PROMO       A radio promo could be the icing on a student's advertising campaign! A promo might include facts about the usefulness of the invention, a clever jingle or song, sound effects, humor... the possibilities are endless. Students may choose to tape record their promos for use during the Invention Convention.       4. ADVERTISING ACTIVITY      Collect 5 - 6 objects and give them new uses. For instance, a toy hoop could be a waist reducer, and some strange looking kitchen gadget might be a new type of mosquito catcher. Use your imagination! Search everywhere--from the tools in the garage to the kitchen drawer--for fun objects. Divide the class into small groups, and give each group one of the objects to work with. The group is to give the object a catchy name, write a slogan, draw an ad, and record a radio promo. Stand back and watch the creative juices flow. Variation: Collect magazine ads and have the students create new advertising campaigns using a different marketing angle.       Activity #10      PARENT INVOLVEMENT     Few, if any, projects are successful unless the child    is encouraged by the parents and other caring adults. Once the children have    developed their own, original ideas, they should discuss them with their parents.    Together, they can work to make the child's idea come to life by making a model.    Although the making of a model is not necessary, it makes the project more interesting    and adds another dimension to the project. You can involve parents by simply    sending a letter home to explain the project and let them know how they may    participate. One of your parents may have invented something that they can share    with the class. (See sample parent letter on p. 45.)               Activity #11      YOUNG INVENTORS' DAY      Plan    a Young Inventors' Day so that your students can be recognized for their inventive    thinking. This day should provide opportunities for the children to display    their inventions and tell the story of how they got their idea and how it works.    They can share with other students, their parents, and others.      When a child successfully completes a task, it is important that (s)he be recognized for the effort. All children who participate in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project are winners.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has prepared a certificate    that can be copied and given to all children who participate and use       their inventive thinking skills to create an invention    or innovation. This award, signed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and    Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, is included on page 47.          Activity #12      ENRICHMENT     The following stories about great thinkers and inventors    will help to motivate your students and enhance their appreciation of the contributions    of inventors to the American way of life.      As students read these stories, they will also realize the ""inventors"" are male, female, old, young, minority, and majority. They are ordinary people who follow through with their creative ideas to make their dreams a reality.     1. GREAT THINKERS AND THEIR INVENTIONS     Earmuffs  ""Baby, Its Cold Outside"" may have been the song running through 13 year old Chester Greenwood's head one cold December day in 1873. To protect his ears while ice skating, he found a piece of wire, and with his grandmother's help, padded the ends. In the beginning, his friends laughed at him. However, when they realized that he was able to stay outside skating long after they had gone inside freezing, they stopped laughing. Instead, they began to ask Chester to make ear covers for them, too. At age 17 Chester applied for a patent. For the next 60 years, Chester's factory made earmuffs, and earmuffs made Chester rich!        BAND-AID ® At the turn of the century,    Mrs. Earl Dickson, an inexperienced cook, often burned and cut herself. Mr.    Dickson, a Johnson and Johnson employee, got plenty of practice in hand bandaging!    Out of concern for his wife's safety, he began to prepare bandages ahead of    time so that his wife could apply them by herself. By combining a piece of surgical    tape and a piece of gauze, he fashioned the first crude adhesive strip bandage!      LIFE-SAVERS ®  Candy  During the hot summer of 1913, Clarence Crane, a chocolate candy manufacturer, found himself facing a dilemma. When he tried to ship his chocolates to candy shops in other cities they melted into gooey blobs. To avoid dealing with the ""mess,"" his customers were deferring their orders until cool weather. In order to retain his customers, Mr. Crane needed to find a substitute for the melted chocolates. He experimented with hard candy which wouldn't melt during shipment. Using a machine designed for making medicine pills, Crane produced small, circular candies with a hole in the middle. The birth of LIFE SAVERS!     FRISBEE ® The    term FRISBEE did not always refer to the familiar plastic disks we visualize    flying through the air. Long ago (over 100 years ago), in Bridgeport, Connecticut,    William Russell Frisbie owned the Frisbie Pie Company and delivered his pies    locally. All of his pies were baked in the same type of 10"" round tin with a    raised edge, wide brim, six small holes in the bottom, and ""Frisbie Pies"" on    the bottom. Playing catch with the tins soon became a popular local sport. However,    the tins were slightly dangerous when a toss was missed. It became the Yale    custom to yell ""Frisbie"" when throwing a pie tin. In the 40's when plastic emerged,    the pie-tin game was recognized as a manufacturable and marketable product.    (Note: FRISBEE ®  is a registered trademark of Wham-O Mfg. Co.)      2. THOMAS EDISON AND OTHER YOUNG INVENTORS          If I were to tell you that  Thomas Alva Edison  had shown signs of inventive genius at an early age, you probably would not be surprised. Mr. Edison achieved enormous fame with his lifelong contributions of volumes of inventive technology. He received the first of his 1,093 U.S. patents by age 22. In the book,  Fire of Genius,  Ernest Heyn reported on a remarkable resourceful young Edison--though some of his earliest tinkering clearly lacked merit.     By the age of six, Thomas Edison's experiments with fire were said to have cost his father a barn. Soon after that, it is reported that young Edison tried to launch the first human balloon by persuading another youth to swallow large quantities of effervescing powders to inflate himself with gas. Of course, the experiments brought quite unexpected results!     Chemistry and electricity held great fascination for this child, Thomas Edison. By his early teens, he had designed and perfected his first real invention, an electrical cockroach control system. He glued parallel strips of tinfoil to a wall and wired the strips to the poles of a powerful battery--quite a shock for the unsuspecting insect.     As a dynamo of creativity, Mr. Edison stood as decidedly unique; but as a child with a curious, problem-solving nature, he was not alone. Here are some more ""inventive children"" we grew to know and appreciate:         At age 14, one schoolboy invented a rotary brush device to remove husks from    wheat in the flour mill run by his friend's father. The young inventor's name?    Alexander Graham Bell.           At 16, another of our junior achievers saved pennies    to buy materials for his chemistry experiments. While still a teenager, he set    his mind on developing a commercially viable aluminum refining process. By age    25, Charles Hall received a patent on his revolutionary electrolytic process.           While only 19 years old, another imaginative young    person designed and built his first helicopter. In the summer of 1909, it very    nearly flew. Years later, Igor Sikorsky perfected his design and saw his early    dreams change aviation history. Silorsky was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1987.      Scores of childhood problem-solvers abound. Perhaps you've    heard about:      *  Samuel Colt's  childhood experience with underwater explosives;     *  Fourteen-year-old  Robert Fulton's  manually operated paddlewheel; and     *  Guglielmo Marconi's  early mechanical/electrical tinkering.     Even the father of television,  Philo T. Farnsworth,  conceived his optical scanning idea at the tender age of 14.     3. GREAT WOMEN INVENTORS      Inventions tell something about the inventor's place in the society in which (s)he lives, a closeness to certain kinds of problems, and possession of certain skills. It is not surprising that up until the mid 20th Century, women's inventions were often related to childcare, housework, and healthcare, all traditional female occupations. In recent years, with access to specialized training and broader job opportunities, women are applying their creativity to many new kinds of problems, including those requiring high technology.While women have frequently come up with new ways to make their work easier, they have not always received credit for their ideas. Some stories about early women inventors show that women often recognized that they were entering ""a man's world,"" and shielded their work from the public eye by allowing men to patent their inventions.     *  Although Eli Whitney received a patent for a cotton gin,  Catherine Greene  is said to have posed both the problem and the basic idea to Whitney. Furthermore, according to Matilda Gage, ( Women as Inventor,  1883), his first model, fitted with wooden teeth, did not do the work well, and Whitney was about to throw the work aside, when Mrs. Greene proposed the substitution of wire to catch the cotton seeds.     OTHER WOMEN INVENTORS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES      * Margaret Knight,  remembered as ""the female Edison,"" received some 26 patents for such diverse items as a window frame and sash, machinery for cutting shoe soles, and improvements to internal combustion engines. Her most significant patent was for machinery that would automatically fold and glue paper bags to create square bottoms, an invention which dramatically changed shopping habits. Workmen reportedly refused her advice when first installing the equipment because, ""after all, what does a woman know about machines?""     * Sarah Breedlove    Walker,  the daughter of former slaves, was orphaned at seven and widowed    by 20. Madame Walker is credited with inventing hair lotions, creams, and an    improved hair styling hot comb. But her greatest achievement may be the development    of the Walker System, which included a broad offering of cosmetics, licensed    Walker Agents, and Walker Schools, which offered meaningful employment and personal    growth to thousands of Walker Agents, mostly Black women. Sarah Walker was the    first American woman self-made millionaire.           * Bette Graham  hoped    to be an artist, but circumstances led her into secretarial work. Bette, however,    was not an accurate typist. Fortunately, she recalled that artists could correct    their mistakes by painting over them with gesso, so she invented a quick drying    ""paint"" to cover her typing mistakes. Bette first prepared the secret formula    in her kitchen using a hand mixer, and her young son helped to pour the mixture    into little bottles. In 1980, the Liquid Paper Corporation, which Bette Graham    built, was sold for over $47 million.      * Ann Moore,  a Peace Corps volunteer, saw how African women carried babies on their backs by tying cloth around their bodies, leaving both hands free for other work. When she returned to the United States, she designed a carrier which became the popular SNUGLI. Recently Ms. Moore received another patent for a carrier to conveniently transport oxygen cylinders. People needing oxygen for breathing assistance, who were previously confined to stationary oxygen tanks, can now move about more freely. Her company now sells several versions including lightweight backpacks, handbags, shoulder bags, and wheelchair/walker carriers for portable cylinders.     * Stephanie Kwolek,     one of Dupont's leading chemists, discovered the ""miracle fiber,"" Kevlar,    which has five times the strength of steel by weight. Uses for Kevlar are seemingly    endless, including ropes and cables for oil drilling rigs, canoe hulls, boat    sails, automobile bodies and tires, and military and motorcycle helmets. Many    Viet Nam veterans and police officers are alive today because of protection    provided by bullet-proof vests made from Kevlar. Because of its strength and    lightness, Kevlar was chosen as the material for the Gossamer Albatross, a pedal    airplane flown across the English Channel. Kwolek was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.      * Gertrude B. Elion,     1988 Nobel laureate in Medicine, and Scientist Emeritus with Burroughs Wellcome    Company, is credited with the synthesis of two of the first successful drugs    for Leukemia, as well as Imuron, an agent to prevent the rejection of kidney    transplants, and Zovirax, the first selective antiviral agent against herpes    virus infections. Researchers who discovered AZT, a breakthrough treatment for    AIDS, used Elion's protocols. Elion was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1991, the first woman inductee.           Did you know      *  windshield wipers    were patented by  Mary Anderso   n  in    1903?      *  dandruff shampoo was patented by  Josie Stuart  in 1903?     *  a dishwasher was patented by  Josephine Cochrane  in 1914?     *  the first disposable diaper was patented by  Marion Donovan  in 1951?     *  a compact portable hair dryer was patented by  Harriet J. Stern  in 1962?     *  a dough product for frozen pizza was patented by  Rose Totino  in 1979?     *  the Melitta Automatic Drip Coffee Maker was patented by  Melitta Benz  in Germany in 1908?                 Note: Much of the material in this section was        drawn from the Minnesota Historical Society Exhibit, ""Her Works Praise Her,        Inventions by Women.""

GREAT MINORITY INVENTORS      Between 1863 and 1913, approximately 1,200 inventions were patented by Black inventors. Many more were unidentified because they hid their race to avoid discrimination. Some sold their inventions to White men. The following stories are about a few of the great minority inventors.     *  Elijah McCoy.     Have you ever heard of the term ""real McCoy?"" That term may apply to a famous    Black inventor by the name of Elijah McCoy. He earned about 50 patents, but    the most famous one was for a metal or glass cup that fed oil to bearings through    a small-bore tube. Machinists and engineers who wanted genuine McCoy lubricators    may have originated the term ""the real McCoy."" Elijah McCoy was born in Ontario,    Canada, in 1843, the son of slaves who had fled Kentucky. He died in Michigan    in 1929.      *     Benjamin Banneker.  Benjamin Banneker created    the first striking clock made of wood in America. He became known as the ""Afro-American    Astronomer."" He published an almanac and with his knowledge of mathematics and    astronomy, he assisted in the surveying and planning of the new city of Washington,    D.C.       *  Granville Woods     had more than 60 patents. Known as the ""Black Edison,"" he improved Bell's    telegraph and created an electrical motor that made the underground subway possible.    He also improved the airbrake.      *  Garrett Morgan     invented the traffic signal that saved thousands of lives when the automobile    became popular. He also invented a safety hood for firefighters.      *  George Washington    Carver  changed the South with his many inventions. He discovered over 300    different products made from the peanut which, until Carver, was considered    a lowly food fit for hogs. He dedicated himself to teaching others, learning    and working with nature. He created over 125 new products with the sweet potato    and taught poor farmers how to rotate crops to i   mprove    their soil and their cotton. George Washington Carver was a great scientist    and inventor who learned to be a careful observer and who was honored throughout    the world for his creation of new things.

Copy Masters         INVENTION IDEA SURVEY        One of the best ways to collect ideas for developing    an innovation or invention is to take a survey. Make sure to survey a variety    of people of all different ages and occupations. The more people you talk to,    the more ideas you will get. The following list of questions may help you:      1. What does not work as well as you would like it to    work?      2. What job(s) would you like to see solved?      3. What problem(s) would you like to see solved?      4.

The Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project is a school activity which promotes analytical and creative thinking and problem solving. Parents can enjoy this project at home with their children by encouraging creative ideas, letting them share ideas with the family, and by assisting them with making models of their inventive ideas.     Our students will be asked to survey you, their friends, and other family members to discover a problem that needs solving. Perhaps the cap is always left off of the toothpaste or your child is always losing sneakers, pencils or mittens. Once the children find problems to solve, they will begin thinking of many ideas that might solve those problems. When they do this, they will be combining many of the skills learned in science, social studies, language, writing, art, library, math, and more.     Each student participating in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project will receive a certificate of recognition from the Assistant Secretary and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in Washington, D.C., and will share the invention with other students at our school.     Thank you for your support in this special and imaginative    adventure in learning. You will be receiving more information during the school    year.       Teacher  __________________________________   Principal  __________________________________     Certificate of Recognition for Innovative Achievement              POSITIVE COMMENTS          Presenter's Name:________________________________________      What I like most about your invention is:          ""Praise is the best diet for us, after all...""

Every time you write in the log, you should initial and date your entry and also have it signed by a witness. A witness can be anyone who knows what you are working on that day--mom, dad, friend, brother, sister, etc. The list below includes some of the items that might be recorded in your log. You will think of others. Remember, every time you work on your project or just ""think"" about your idea, you should record it in your inventor's log or notebook.

People     Drawings of Possible Solutions:       Results of Interviews:       Results of Surveys:       Other       A PATENT, TRADEMARK,    AND COPYRIGHT PRIMER     On March 6, 1646, Joseph Jenkes received the first mechanical    patent in North America. Issued by the General Court of Massachusetts, it protected    his mill for manufacturing scythes. That was the prelude to the U.S. Patent    System which has helped give birth to major industries that have transformed    the way we live.      On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the bill which laid the foundations of the modern American patent system. Since that time, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recorded and protected the electric lamp of Thomas Edison, the telephone of Alexander Graham Bell, the flying machine of the Wright Brothers, and the inventions of hundreds of thousands of other inventors.     The patent system has protected inventors by giving them an opportunity to profit from their labors, and it has benefited society by systematically recording new inventions and releasing them to the public after the inventors' limited rights have expired.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is one of the most unusual branches of the U.S. Government. Its examining staff of about 2,000 is trained in all branches of science and examines thoroughly every application to determine whether a patent may be granted--a task, in these days, involving the most exhaustive research. Not only must the examiners search United States and foreign patents to learn if a similar patent has been issued, but they must study scientific books and publications to discover whether the idea has ever been described. Previous publications, invention, or use prevents a patent being issued.     In addition to issuing patents, the Patent and Trademark Office has, since 1870, been in charge of registering trademarks, the business community's most valuable asset. More than 1,400,000 trademarks have been issued.     In its earlier days, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had on various occasions the responsibility for administering copyright matters, a task that since 1870 has been administered by the Library of Congress; collecting and publishing agricultural information; and even collecting meteorological data. For some years, it was the custodian not only of the famous old Patent Office models--the delight of every visitor to Washington for many years--but of the Declaration of Independence, and other historical documents and relics.     By publishing and distributing copies of every U.S. patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has made available to the public the world's greatest scientific and mechanical library.     Patents in Brief     A patent is a grant issued by the U.S. Government giving inventors the right to exclude all others from making, using, or selling their inventions within the United States, its territories, and possessions.     There are three kinds of patents: (1) utility patents, granted to the inventor or discoverer of any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; (2) plant patents, granted on any distinct and new variety of asexually reproduced plant; and (3) design patents, granted on any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.     Utility and plant patents are granted for a term which begins on the date of the grant and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was first filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees; design patents are granted for a term of 14 years from the date of the grant. Patents may be extended only by special act of Congress, except for some pharmaceutical patents whose terms may be extended to make up for time lost due to Government-required testing.     If you plan to file an application, you or your representative should make a search of patents previously granted to make sure that your idea has not already been patented. You may do this at the Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office, Crystal Plaza Building No. 3, 2021 South Clark Place, Arlington, Virginia. Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except holidays. More limited searches may be made at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries located throughout the country.     The patent application process can be complex, and the Patent and Trademark Office cannot assist in the preparation of application papers. We strongly advise prospective applicants to engage the services of a patent attorney or agent. Although the PTO cannot recommend any particular attorney or agent and does not control their fees, we do maintain a roster of approximately 17,000 patent attorneys and agents registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This roster is available for inspection at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents at the Government Printing Office, or on the World Wide Web (http://www.uspto.gov).     The basic fee for filing an application for patent ranges from $160 to $770, depending on the type of patent application being filed and whether or not the applicant is entitled to status as a small entity (independent inventor, small business concern, or non-profit organization). Issue fees range from $220 to $1,290. Maintenance fees are due at 3 1 Ž 2 , 7 1 Ž 2 , and 11 1 Ž 2  years from the date the patent is granted. An individual inventor can expect to pay a minimum of $4,000 for a utility patent.     Applications are assigned to examiners who are experts in various fields of technology. The invention must be new, useful, and unobvious to those in that particular field of study. This procedure normally takes about 19 months.     Disclosure Document Program     Under its Disclosure Document Program, the PTO accepts and preserves for a two-year period papers disclosing an invention pending the filing of an application for patent. This disclosure is accepted as evidence of the dates of conception of the invention, but provides no patent protection nor should it be considered a ""grace period"" during which the inventor can wait to file a patent application without possible loss of benefits. A fee of $10 is charged for this service.     Provisional Patent Application     A provisional application establishes a filing date but does not begin the examination process. It provides the inventor with a one-year period to further develop the invention, determine marketability, acquire funding or capital, or seek licensing agreements. To obtain a patent, the inventor must file a nonprovisional application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. The fee is $150 or $75 for a small entity.     Trademarks in Brief     A trademark (or brand name or logo) is a word, name, symbol, design, combination of word and design or slogan used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its goods or services and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. When it is used for services, it can be called a service mark.     Trademark rights come from using the mark, and marks are protected under common law from the time they are first used. While there is no requirement to do so, owners of marks who have used them or have a bona fide intention to use them in Federally regulated commerce may register them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This provides the owners with certain procedural and legal advantages. For intent-to-use applications, actual use of the mark in commerce is a prerequisite to the ultimate issuance of a registration.     Many trademark owners use a  ™  (trademark) or  SM  (service mark) symbol with their mark to indicate that they are claiming rights in it. The  ®  symbol may only be used if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Federal registration. To register a mark, the owner must file an application consisting of a written statement in which the owner indicates among other things the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used and the date of first use of the mark in commerce; a drawing of the mark; five specimens showing the mark as it is actually used (labels, tags, packaging, etc.); and the required filing fee of $245 per class.     Each application is reviewed by an examining attorney to determine if the mark is eligible for registration and is compared with other marks to determine if it is likely to cause confusion with those already registered. If a proposed mark passes the examination, it is then published in the  Official Gazette  of the Patent and Trademark Office. Those who believe they will be damaged by registration of the mark then have an opportunity to oppose registration. If no opposition is filed, a registration certificate is issued or a notice of allowance is issued to the applicant in an intent-to-use application. Within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file specimens evidencing use of the mark in commerce, a fee of $100, and a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce before a registration certificate is issued. The registration may be renewed every 10 years as long as the registrant is still using the mark.     Note: Fees mentioned above represent only the minimum required for a patent or trademark application. Additional fees may be due during the prosecution of an application. Fees are current as of October 1996. Fee increases, when necessary, usually take effect on October 1 of any given year. For a complete list of fees or further information, write to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Center for Patent and Trademark Information, Washington, DC 20231, or call 800-786-9199 or 703-308-HELP(4357).      Copyrights in Brief     The seeds of copyright protection were sown in Gutenberg's development of the printing press that ultimately led to the first printed copyright statute, the English Statute of Anne. Both the printing press and the concept of copyright protection followed the colonists to the new world. The state legislature of 12 of the first states passed copyright laws before Congress enacted the first Federal law. On may 31, 1790, Congress used the power given it in Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to ""promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries"" and enacted the first Federal Copyright Act.      Noah Webster, the compiler of both the first American speller and an early dictionary, played a major role in getting both the state laws and the first Federal statute enacted. He traveled to each legislature and described the authors' plight and their need for copyright protection. Authors have continued to guard the rights granted by the Constitution and to ensure that new technologies permitting copying do not erode these rights.     What is copyright and when does copyright protection arise?  Federal copyright legislation gives an author certain exclusive rights for a limited time: the right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords, to perform the work publicly, and to display the work publicly. Congress attempts to create a balance between the rights given to authors and the legitimate needs for society. There are some limitations or exemptions that permit society to make specific uses of copyrighted works.     Copyright subsists in an original work of authorship from the time the work is first created or fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated. A work is put in a tangible form, for example, when a literary work is typed or written or a piece of music captured on tape.     Copyright covers the expression of ideas and not the idea itself. Thus, copyright does not cover ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery..."" It does not, for example, protect blank checks, standardized material, titles, or government works.     What does copyright protection mean for an author?  Copyright means that no one may appropriate the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display a work without permission from the author unless the right has been transferred to the user or the person who authorizes or licenses this particular use, or an exemption covers the use in question.      What works does copyright protect?  The first law protected maps, charts, and books for a basic term of 14 years; since 1790 the copyright law has evolved to include musical works, dramatic works, photographs, paintings, and other works of art, motion pictures, and sound recordings.     Literary works:  Copyright protects literary works of all types from novels such as  Gone With the Wind  or  The Catcher in the Rye,  to text books and other fact-based accounts, including newspapers. Although copyright covers the expression in non-fiction works, it does not cover the facts themselves. They are uncopyrightable and can be freely used by anyone. Copyright in the literary works also covers printed speeches such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""I have a dream"" speech. Today, even computer programs are protected as literary works.     Musical works:  Copyright covers all kinds of music from the songs performed on the radio to the music in television commercials and MTV.     Dramatic works:  Copyright covers every kind of permanently fixed dramatic work from senior plays such as Our Town performed by high schools, to such current Broadway blockbusters as Phantom of the Opera, M. Butterfly, or the latest Neil Simon offering. It covers those plays written especially for the theater like Arthur Miller's classic Death of a Salesman and also those based on other popular works like the adaptation of Kafka's short story Metamorphosis.     Pantomimes and choreographic works:  Copyright protects dance sequences in stage shows like Chorus Line or Cats if they are in tangible form.     Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:  Works created by sculptors, photographers, painters, and other graphic artists are protected by copyright. The works covered include not only paintings, photographs, and sculptures, but also advertisements, the artwork on game boards, and the artwork on fabrics or textiles.     Motion pictures and other audiovisual works:  Classics like The Wizard of Oz or the latest Steven Spielberg or Woody Allen film are protectible, as are television programs and ideograms, including the once very popular Pac Man and the currently popular Nintendo games.     Sound recordings:  The copyright law was amended in 1971 to include sound recordings. Copyright now protects the latest recording of your favorite artists in any format--disk (be it 45, 33, or compact disk), tape, or cassette. The copyright authorship protected in a sound recording is two-fold: it covers the contribution of both the performer and the record producer responsible for the recording.     How long is a work protected?  As noted earlier, the 1790 act provided a 14 year term. Mark Twain was one of the authors who persuaded Congress that the term should be longer. In 1909 the term was extended to protect authors for a 28 year term plus a possibility of 28 more years if the author renewed his or her claim in a timely fashion. Then in 1976 the term was extended again to its current length: the life of the author plus 50 years. Special rules apply to works created by employees as part of their jobs such as motion pictures and anonymous or pseudonymous works.     When the term of the protection expires on a particular work, it may be used freely by anyone.     Where is the work protected?  A work copyrighted in the United States is protected here as well as in all of the other countries with whom we have copyright relations by our membership in the two multilateral copyright treaties--the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, by presidential proclamation, or bilateral relations. The United States has copyright relations with over 100 countries.     Note: The filing fee for each application is $20.   The Copyright Office has the authority to adjust fees at five-year intervals.

More than a toy.   selected    toy patents.   5. Rumor has it... that a patent office official    resigned because ""everything that can be invented has been invented.""                  The First Patent Grant in the    United States       The patent grant you see reproduced on the next page    was the first one issued by the United States, to Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford,    Vermont in 1790. Two other patents were granted that year: one for a special    process of making candles and one for improved flour milling machinery. The    Hopkins patent was for an ""Improvement, not known before such Discovery, in    the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new apparatus and Process"", and was    granted for a term of fourteen years.      The name potash refers to several potassium salts, mild    alkalis, which were derived from the ashes of timber or other plants. It was    also known in a caustic form when mixed with lime. In reacting with fats or    oils, potash produced a soft soap. It was an essential ingredient in the manufacture    of glass, alum (salts of aluminum--used chiefly in medicine), and saltpetre    (an important ingredient in gun powder). Potash also played an important role    in bleaching, mining, metallurgy, and other industrial interests. Its many applications    served as an indication of the emerging chemical industry in the nineteenth    century.      In the summer of 1956, the Vermont Historic Sites Commission    erected a marker at the former residence of Samuel Hopkins. The original patent    granted to him still exists in the collections of the Chicago Historical Society.                            Abraham Lincoln is the only U.S. president to receive a    patent. Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois in 1849 when he was issued Patent    No. 6,469 for a ""manner of buoying vessels.""      As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise    down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. The boat slid onto    a dam and was dislodged only after heroic efforts. A few years later, while    crossing the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. These two similar    experiences led him to invent a solution to the problem.      The invention consists of a set of bellows attached to    the hull of a ship just below the water line. When a vessel is in danger of    getting stuck in shallow water, the bellows are filled with air, and the vessel,    thus buoyed, floats clear of the obstacle.      Although Lincoln probably never profited from his invention,    he was a strong supporter of the patent system, saying that the patent system    ""added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production    of new and useful things.""            ""Well    informed people know it is impossible to transmit the voice over wires, and    that, were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value.""    Boston Post editorial, 1865        Perhaps the most famous of all design patents    is the Statue of Liberty.            Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Alva Edison didn't    ""invent"" the light bulb, but rather he improved upon a 50-year-old idea. In    1879, using lower current, a small carbonized filament, and an improved vacuum    inside the globe, he was able to produce a reliable, long-lasting source of    light. Perhaps more importantly, Edison's invention led to an industry to distribute    electric power creating jobs for many Americans.      Edison was granted his first patent on June 1, 1869,    and averaged one patent application every 11 days between 1869 and 1910. America's    most prolific inventor received 1,093 patents--more than any other person before    or since. While he reveled in and profited from his successes, he lived with    failure every day.       ""Results? Why man, I've gotten a lot of results. I know    several thousand things that won't work.""       Thomas Alva Edison, 1900      In 1973, Edison was the first inventor inducted into    the National Inventors Hall of Fame.            Lewis    Howard Latimer was employed by a Patent Solicitor where he began the study of    drafting. His talent for drafting and his creative genius led him to invent    a method of making carbon filaments for the electric incandescent lamp. Latimer    was the original draftsman for Thomas Edison and the star witness in suits which    infringed upon Edison's patents.                ""Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.""    Lord Kelving, President, Royal Society, c. 1895                         Famous magician Harry Houdini {born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest,    Hungary in 1874} was also an inventor. Houdini began his career as a trapeze    artist and was later renowned as a magician and an escape artist. He astonished    audiences by escaping from handcuffs, straitjackets, and prison cells. Houdini's    invention for a ""diver's suit"" permits divers, in case of danger, to quickly    divest themselves of the suit while submerged and to safely escape and reach    the surface of the water.      In his later years, Houdini put his extensive knowledge    of the occult and magic to public benefit by exposing the tricks of fraudulent    spiritualistic mediums. Houdini left his entire library of magic to the U.S.    Library of Congress.                     ""When you can do the common things in life    in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world."" George Washington    Carver         Since 1930, plants have been patentable.    The first plant patent was granted to Henry F. Bosenberg for a climbing or trailing    rose.        An    Wang was born in Shanghai, China. He immigrated to the United States in 1945    and received his Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University in 1948. He    founded Wang Laboratories in 1951 to develop specialty electronic devices. Dr.    Wang is responsible for the original development of the basic components and    systems of digital computing machines. He held more than 35 patents, revolutionizing    the information processing industry. Dr. Wang was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988.           Phillip J. Stevens holds several patents for innovative    concepts in weaponry. He directed the Minuteman III Weapon System at TRW, Inc.,    and founded Ultrasystems, Inc., a high-technology business enterprise. A former    director of the United Indian Development Association, he received multiple    awards for leadership, innovation, and support of the Native American people.      Stevens with co-inventor, Larry E. Hughes, invented a    new nozzle to control delivery of propellants from rocket motors. The new variable    area throat nozzle was simple in construction, light in weight, efficient in    operation, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.                   Ysidro M. Martinez' invention of a below-the-knee prosthesis    avoids some of the problems associated with conventional artificial limbs. Martinez,    an amputee himself, took a theoretical approach in his design. He does not attempt    to replicate the natural limb with articulated joints in the ankle or foot which    is seen by Martinez as causing poor gait. His prosthesis has a high center of    mass and is light in weight to facilitate acceleration and deceleration and    reduce friction. The foot is considerably shorter to control acceleration forces,    reducing the friction and pressure.                The mouse that went to Harvard... was the    first animal to be patented in the United States. In the 1980s, Philip Leder    devised a method of introducing specific oncogenes (genes with the potential    to cause other cells to become cancerous) into mice. The transgenic non-human    eukaryotic animal is bred to contract breast cancer for medial research to facilitate    carcinogen testing and development of cancer therapies. As you can imagine,    the patenting of living organisms (nonhuman) has generated controversy and a    lot of public debate on the ethical, religious, economic, and regulatory issues    arising from their use.      More than a toy...       Everyone has a favorite toy--a cuddly bear, a rugged    truck, a special game. But how many of us connect that toy with a multi-billion    dollar industry that thrives on innovation?      America's toy manufacturers and retailers depend heavily    on intellectual property protection. Toy inventors use both utility and design    patents, along with trademarks and copyrights to prevent others from copying    or profiting from their inventions or their trade names. In fact, many toys--especially    video games--take advantage of all three types of intellectual property protection.      Americans did not enter the toy ""business"" until the    1830's, when steamboats and steam trains improved the transportation and distribution    of manufactured goods. Early toymakers used wood, tin, or cast iron to fashion    horses, soldiers, wagons, and other simple toys. Charles Goodyear's method for    ""vulcanizing"" rubber created another medium for manufacturing balls, dolls,    and squeeze toys.      Toys Turn On!       In the early 1970's, Pong, the first patented video game,    hit the market. Nolan Bushnell created it along with a company named Atari.    Pong debuted in arcades, and soon moved on to television screens in living rooms    around the world. Other games followed--Space Invaders, Pac Man, and Tron. As    technology advanced, the dedicated single game machine was replaced by programmable    machines that allowed different games to be played simply by exchanging a cartridge.      Inventions in circuitry and miniaturization in the early    1980's produced handheld games, as Nintendo, a Japanese electronics company,    along with many others, moved into the video game market. As home computers    become more accessible, video games become more versatile, action packed, challenging,    and diverse.      As society has progressed, so has the complexity and    diversity of our amusements. Once, toys simply reflected everyday life and activities.    Today, toys create new ways of living, teach us to adapt to changing technologies,    and inspire us to follow our dreams.      The    Ups and Downs of Yo-Yo's       The Yo-Yo, a weapon used in South Pacific cultures, has    been traced back to the ancient Greeks. First patented in 1866 by James L. Haven    and Charles Hettrich, the Yo-Yo has enjoyed periods of popularity for generations    with kids from 1 - 100.      Donald Duncan was the marketing genius responsible for    the first American Yo-Yo fad of the 1930's. He also invented the Eskimo Pie,    originated the Good Humor Ice Cream truck, and successfully marketed the first    parking meter. At one time, Lego Co. used unsold Yo-Yo's as wheels on toy trucks.    In 1962, the most recent period of popularity, Duncan sold 45 million of the    toy.                                                      Rumor has it...       that a Patent Office official resigned and recommended    that the Patent Office be closed because he thought that everything that could    possibly be invented had already been invented!      While that statement makes good fun of predictions that    do not come to pass, it is none the less just a myth. Researchers have found    no evidence that any official or employee of the U.S. Patent Office had ever    resigned because there was nothing left to invent. A clue to the origin of the    myth may be found in Patent Office Commissioner Henry Ellsworth's 1843 report    to Congress. In it he states, ""The advancement of the arts, from year to year,    taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human    improvement must end."" But Commissioner Ellsworth was simply using a bit of    rhetorical flourish to emphasize the growing number of patents as presented    in the rest of the report. He even outlined specific areas in which he expected    patent activity to increase in the future.       Taken out of context, such remarks take on a life of    their own and are perpetuated in publication after publication whose authors,    rather than check facts, copy and quote each other. For example, recent publications    have attributed the ""everything that has been invented..."" quote to a later    commissioner, Charles H. Duell, who held that office in 1899. Unlike Ellsworth,    who may have been merely misquoted, there is absolutely no basis to support    Duell's alleged statement. Just the opposite is true. Duell's 1899 report documents    an increase of about 3,000 patents over the previous year, and nearly 60 times    the number granted in 1837. Further, Duell quotes President McKinley's annual    message saying, ""Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability    to equal, if not surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science,    industry and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful    aids to the accomplishment of such a result."" Duell adds, ""May not our inventors    hopefully look to the Fifty-sixth Congress for aid and effectual encouragement    in improving the American patent system?"" These are unlikely words of someone    who thinks that everything has been invented.      References:      Jeffery, Dr. Eber.  Journal of the Patent Office Society.     July 1940      Sass, Samuel.

FIFTH MEETING  Thursday, July 11, 2002     Session 3: Stem Cells 4: NIH Funding of Stem Cell Research (Implementation)      Dr. Wendy Baldwin, Office of Extramural Research    National Institutes of Health        CHAIRMAN KASS:  On the record.  Thank you very much.  I think we should start.  We have a couple of stragglers, Dr. Baldwin.  There are always a couple of stragglers.  I think since your schedule is tight we should get moving.   It's a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Wendy Baldwin who is the Deputy Director for Extramural Research in the Office of the Director of NIH.  And who after President Bush announced his decision on stem cell research, he was finished and she was not.  She has come to talk to us about the implementation of the President's policy on stem cell research.  We've been looking forward to learning exactly what's happening.  It's very good of you to come and join us and educate us this afternoon.  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you, Dr. Kass.  I'm very happy to be here and to tell you how I've been keeping myself busy in implementing this policy.  Let me go through a little bit.  I don't have handouts of the overheads, but I'd be happy to leave the overheads if you'd like.  I don't think I have to go into much detail with this group certainly about what the embryonic stem cells are, their unique properties, their ability to proliferate, and the capability of forming other kinds of cells.  So that has importance for basic science understanding of what cells do as well as our anticipation of clinical application as well.   There are many areas that we feel are major questions for us to think about where stem cells are going to influence how biology is done and what the importance will be.  Our major activity right now has been to implement the policy that was put in place last August 9th.  So the criteria for allowing research with federal funding on human ES cells is shown on this slide.  I think we're probably all familiar with this.   They had to have been derived from a blastocyst that was initiated prior to the President announcing his policy.  The embryo had to have been created for reproductive purposes and no longer needed which means it came basically from IVF clinics.  There had to be informed consent from the donors to use these cells with no financial inducement for the donation.   The way we're implementing this is that having established these criteria our first job was to complete the documentation and ensure that we had documentation, that the available lines met these criteria, and then to post a registry.  Once we did that then an investigator could go to the registry and identify a line that they wanted to use knowing that it met the President's policy.  So this is front-loading if you will that review process.   On November 7, 2001, we published the NIH Registry.  I've given you minimal handouts.  You must have 150 pounds of paper to carry back with you.  Your handout from me is one single sheet of paper, two-sided.  On the front, it shows you the registry.  On the back, it shows the stem cell site on the NIH website that has every conceivable document.  People are looking around like they don't have it.  Do they have it?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I'm afraid there's been a slip up.   DR. BALDWIN:  We will get it to you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Does anyone have these?   DR. BALDWIN:  It's a page.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  They're coming right now.   DR. BALDWIN:  Once you go to the stem cell section of the NIH website, basically all of our documentation, information, et cetera is there and is updated regularly.  It took us a little while to get the registry up.  We wanted to be sure that we had developed it in a way that would be user-friendly and that we had unique codes for the different stem cell lines.  It went up November 7th.  Then what we did was we started to put in place the things that would be needed for investigators to make use of the registry and actually obtain funding to do this research.   The first thing we did was to realize that we had amissed the posting of the registry so that people could come in for our October 1 receipt date.  NIH has three rounds of application receipts.  So what we did is extended that receipt date so that anyone who was sitting there poised to do this research still had an opportunity to get an application in.   We then moved on to issue and announcement for Infrastructure Awards so that we could reach out to the sources so we could help them be sure they were actually going to be able to provide stem cells for the researchers who wanted them.  We moved on to Administrative Supplements.  I'll go into these in a little more detail, but it shows you how almost week by week we were putting in place one or another element that was necessary for us to actually fully implement this policy and make it a reality for the research community.   So Administrative Supplements, Training Potential, all of these pieces.  The implementation job was really taking the policy and then saying what are all of the different steps that have to happen to make this actually really work.  Let me go back to that one in a minute.   The last one on there is we announced the procedures for how you could use the process that's in place for having research done on human embryonic germ cells.  In May 20th, we had the first review of such an application.  That's the companion to the embryonic stem cell activities.   As of July 5th when the slide was done, we had made five of these Infrastructure Awards, 13 Administrative Supplements, and one Grant Award.  That I think people can look at and say one award.  How can this be?  But there actually is a fair amount of time that takes place between submitting an application to us, going to scientific review, going to an advisory council, and an actual funding decision made, and an award made.   What you're hearing here is our taking that policy and mainstreaming it in to how NIH does business.  We have very sound principles as to how we do business of transparency and peer review.  We're bringing stem cell research into that process.  At the same time where we've identified what might be a gap or a hurdle or an impediment, we're trying to reach out to that as well whether it's a need for training or a need for infrastructure support.   A few features of this registry.  We are listing all of the cells that meet these criteria.  You may be interested to know that we've added lines since the President's statement because we found six additional lines that met these criteria.  The registry serves two very important functions.  It provides a code for each of these and provides the contact information because an investigator that wants to do this research goes to the registry, identifies a line, and then gets in touch with them.   This is the content of the registry.  When you go to each one, this is what it looks like if you go to it on the web.  You can't read that on the screen.  When you click on any one of these sources, you go to a slash screen that's for that particular source.  This one happens to be WARF.  You'll see that it gives you contact information, e-mail information, their website, and the information about the cell lines that are on there.  That is information we're asking the sources to keep up and keep current because it is their information.   What have we found to be the issues for researchers?  Well, first is the simple access to the line.  Are there intellectual property issues, IRB issues, administrative ones, and ones relative to how they're going to actually get the skills to work with these lines?  Let me take these one at a time.   There have been questions as to whether these cell lines are actually available.  I think it's important to realize that human embryonic stem cell work is relatively new.  Because this was not an area available for federal funding prior to the President's statement, they are largely in foreign sources or commercial entities.  So many of these groups were not at the outset thinking about supplying the scientific community.  That's why we put infrastructure support out there, so that each of the sources can come to us and apply for funding to help them scale up, better characterize their cells, and make them available.   These are the awards that we've already made. (Indicating.) It's on a rolling receipt date though.  It's something that we'll continue to do as long as we have sources that need infrastructure support in order to make their lines available.   There are of course many things that can affect easy access to these lines.  In some cases, we have international issues.  There's been a change in terms of whether biologic material can be shipped on a passenger airplane.  I can't sit here and tell you that it's all simple.  This is not Amazon.com where you can just click on it and it comes by FedEx the next day.  There are things your investigators have to do in order to get access.  They're not qualitatively different from other fields, but they are important in this case.   All of these lines have intellectual property issues associated with them.  As I said by enlarge they are either commercial sources or they are foreign sources.  There is a U.S. patent on the derivation method.  In fact, the sources have to work out their intellectual property agreements in order to make them available.   NIH did something that's a little unusual here.  We of course would have to negotiate a memo of understanding for our investigators to have access to these lines.  We did the first one with Wisconsin with WARF.  What they said was not only would these terms be available to the NIH investigators but they would make them available to other investigators.    That's important to realize because the NIH doesn't get involved in the negotiations between a source and a user.  That's their responsibility.  But what this has done is made it much easier.  In fact, you can go to the website.  Those memos of understanding are all on the website.  An investigator can just download that, click on it, read it, take it to their tech transfer office, and if they can accept the terms which are pretty straight forward, they're ready.  They don't have to negotiate this from the ground up as it were.   We now have four of the MOUs that are available on the website.  I'm walking you through each of these steps because I think it's important to understand the different pieces of this puzzle that had to be put in place so that this whole area of research would actually take off.  Some of these sources may initially want to start out doing collaborative arrangements, and others are further along in their development and are more ready to make them just generally available.  That was clear at the outset that we would have that kind of variability.   This is the flip side of the handout which is the stem cell information site which is absolutely essential if you're interested in this area of research.  On it, you will see all of the MOUs are there.  We run a Frequently Asked Questions section.  We update that as soon as we have anything new to put out there.  Background reports, background material, anything a potential investigator or a funded investigator would want to know.  We're trying to make it one stop shopping so that it is all out there and pretty easily accessible.   In terms of IRB issues, all of these lines had documented informed consent for the donation of the embryo.  One of the follow-on issues though was do any of these lines include identifiable information or not or are they completely anonymized.  We worked with the Office of Human Research Protections to clarify the guidance about when IRB review is needed if there is identifiable information anywhere.  In fact, this document which of course again is on the website clarifies that there can be a firewall, either it's anonymized or the person receiving the line has no potential to get access to any identifying information then that streamlines what they would have to do within their own institution.  OHRP, we would not be requiring IRB review of the use of that line.  Grantee institutions may of course have some additional requirements.   There were questions raised about administrative issues in terms of how to think about the facilities and administrative costs if there were eligible research and ineligible research going on to the same institution.  Again, we felt that there are already very strong and existing policies about unallowable research.  The institutions know how to handle financially unallowable research.  Basically this just clarified for them how to do that, again to mainstream how this issue is handled relative to other areas of unallowable activity.   We have this as an administrative issue.  I'm not sure that it is.  Most research when it comes in it goes through peer review.  Reviewers are really looking for preliminary data.  In a new field, that's particularly challenging.  If it's a brand new field, you may not have preliminary data.    We've taken two tacks there.  One is to now just have Administrative Supplements available, but to really go a little further step to advertise their availability.  What that means is if you're already a funded investigator and let's say you're working on mouse ES cells and within the basic scope of the research you could add on some work in human ES cells, you can come to the NIH for an Administrative Supplement.  They're modest in dollar support, about $50,000.  They're handled administratively.  But it is a way for probably our most promising cadre of investigators to get started in this field and be able to help develop some preliminary data.  We've also tried to deal with that at the stage of review in terms of reminding people that this is an area where it's much more difficult to have preliminary data when you first come in.   One of the difficult issues for us is these are not necessarily easy cells to work with.  We've looked at what the need is there.  Everyone who has worked with human ES cells has pointed out the need for very careful, meticulous laboratory work and that there's a high degree of variability across labs and culture conditions.  So again, we've looked at what would be the tools that we could put out there to help investigators develop those skills.   In some cases, they will get them through the acquisition process.  So a source might package some training along with acquiring the cells from them.  If you go to them in return for the price of getting the cells, you would also get a couple of days of on-site training for maybe your Senior Lab Technician.  But we're trying to look broadly at that.  We have an announcement so that an individual investigator who really wants to specialize in this area could come in and apply for funding or an institution that wants to focus on doing some short term training activities that they would make available to others could apply to us for support.   Again, this is really taking the tools that we already have.  We already know how to work with a community to build skills when it's necessary.  We're just focusing them and applying them to this particular area of science.   The information has been very widely disseminated.  Now, we think it's been widely disseminated.  Just because we think it's widely disseminated doesn't necessarily mean that it is.  I get 350,000 or 400,000 hits a month on my website where this is located.  We get more on the NIH website.  You can access it right from the nih.gov site.   We know some professional associations have been pulling up those Frequently Asked Questions and sending them back out to their constituencies.  One of the things you can certainly help me with is if you can think of any other strategies that we might use to make this information widely available.  That appears to do it.  I wanted to go through that fairly quickly so that you would have a chance in my time here to ask questions.  If anything that I've gone through was either too quick or didn't make sense, please ask me now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Dan Foster and then Janet.   DR.  FOSTER:   I don't work on stem cells.  One of questions I think fairly broadly asked in the scientific community regarding the research is given now the 80 cell lines, how many of those are in some sense adequately characterized to be useful in research.  You know much better than I do, there's been considerable skepticism about the adequacy of these cell lines for the research that we want to do.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, it's a little difficult to give an exact number.  It's certainly in excess of two dozen on there and are pretty well characterized and we know they're available.  I understand the question.  I understand the concern.   I think that we're equally concerned to see that investigators do get started working with the lines that are available.  That's going to be the best test of how good those lines are.  We won't know until people use them and test them and compare two lines from different laboratories.   There's a tremendous amount of basic work that simply has not been done.  While that's certainly an interesting issue to pursue, I'm at the implementation side.  I'm asking are the grant applications coming in.  Are we funding it?  Are we building up a base of knowledge about those lines?  I think we really have to do that.   DR.  FOSTER:  Well, I think that's probably the only answer you have.  We oftentimes say the only way you can answer these questions is to do the experiments.  We had been talking about that earlier today.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  FOSTER:  I think just myself that you've done a wonderful job on this infrastructure so far.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet, would you like to begin?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I'd like to carry on with the first question that Dr. Foster asked you.  Backing up just a bit.  Have you or have you in conjunction with the sources come up with a set of standardized procedures that you're going to do to characterize these lines?  Is everybody karyotyping their lines and doing some molecular analysis of them and what kind of studies have they done for longevity of the lines, et cetera?   DR. BALDWIN:  First off, the next enhancement if you will of the registry is to encourage our sources to provide additional data.  The sources vary as to how much information they have and how much they're posting on those websites.  To encourage them to go ahead and site either their published articles or the research that's being done with their lines, that's the area of enhancement that I'm looking for next.   The next area I think will be for us to bring those sources together.  They really form a very unique network.  It will be bringing them together really as a group that I think would be most valuable, for them to share their experiences as to the most valuable information or where their information appears to be discordant.  We've just made those awards within the last 60 days, so it's just a little early for that.  That would be the approach that I'd be inclined to pursue.   DR.  ROWLEY:   In terms of the Infrastructure Awards that you have made to individuals, you indicated in your very brief overview that you are asking or providing financial support to the sources to do some things.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  ROWLEY:   I guess the question is in your infrastructure grants is there some commonality of information that you are hoping that they will use that support for to provide answers to some of these questions.  Or is it just you have X number of cell lines and it costs X amount to do something.   DR. BALDWIN:   No.  It's not that.  But the first way that you phrased it, I think it would leave the impression that we're saying here's a list of things we want to see, do each of these with each line.  We really haven't done that.  They have come forward, not just give us money and we'll do more, but to say what they will do and that goes through peer review to say is that an appropriate strategy and are they going to be useful tests.   I guess my experience has been especially in a new field bringing those investigators together so that four or five of them sit down and say here's the way I'm going to do this and here's the information that would be valuable.  Having them talk that out to drive it toward some common sense of what is the most appropriate or the useful measures is usually preferable to us saying at the outset the specific ones we want to see.    I know that's a taste in preference.  Some people like a little harder edge at the outset.  I guess my experience has been I prefer to draw some of that out of our sources as opposed to imposing it on the outset.  But I understand your question.   DR.  ROWLEY:  You're aware of the article in Nature suggesting it be some of the cell lines.  Presumably all of these are grown on mouse feeder cell layers or virtually, a number of the cell lines are grown on --   DR. BALDWIN:  Many, yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:   So that the possibility that there are mouse-human hybrids is real.  Those would obviously have limited or no usefulness for the kinds of investigations that many people are interested in.  I guess I'm a cytogeneticist, so the first thing we do for cell lines is karyotype them.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:  I would have thought that it would be an important early parameter for the study section to have required that each one of the grantees do.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is.  I think what you're raising to me may be one of the things that we could do would be to extract from those Infrastructure Awards a little more of the vision of what the sources are proposing to do even in advance of them having the results and having the data to post.  Obviously the abstracts are available.  But we haven't thought about doing that as an extract to see where that common sense of the group as to the most useful activities would be.    They have latitude under a grant application.  It isn't that they're locked into doing one thing.  If six months from now it's clear there's something valuable to do, they could add that to it.  That would be a very useful suggestion for this.  I think I see something to go back and do.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.  Let me just pursue two other aspects of this.  I think it's marvelous that in your dealings with the sources that you have made arrangements for other investigators to get some of the same kinds of expedited access to the lines under the memorandum of understanding.  I think that's marvelous because certainly these material transfer agreements can be painful and to do each one for private investigators is difficult.   You raised the question of cost.  I wonder is there a fair variability.  It seemed to me that as we were approaching WARF it was several thousand dollars to get a single cell line.   DR. BALDWIN:  Because of the network of agreements really, I think that's going to be pretty standardized, the $5,000 for access.  I'm talking about academic researchers not anyone who is accessing for commercial purposes.  Then you can't just download an MOU and go to work.  That's very different if you're setting out to develop them for a commercial activity.  My interest is here, what we can do for the basic research community.   DR.  ROWLEY:   Now, also in dealing with WARF, the MTA did include statements that any discoveries we make with those cell lines the intellectual property reverts to WARF.  I don't know whether in more recent memorandum of understanding whether that's --   DR. BALDWIN:   (Off the microphone.)   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   I don't think so.  I could have brought you a whole notebook of this material.  But I don't think that's the case for the academic researcher.  Again, the MOU is downloadable.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could I just ask a question because this is an important question to lots of people?  Could I have Janet ask the question again and could I hear the answer again so I know what we've just had?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I was raising the question that it was my impression that as we approached the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation that were we to buy the cell line --   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Which is $5,000 and we did research with it, any intellectual discoveries that we made then became the property of WARF, not of us.  There are a lot of these MTAs that have what are called pass-throughs.  This was the question.  Whether I was mis-remembering or whether possibly your memorandum of understanding is maybe a bit different than I recall from maybe four or five months ago because I haven't paid attention to this recently.   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't think that has changed in that time.  I do have a copy and I'd be happy to leave it with you.  I think you may be thinking of when you're obtaining the cell lines for a commercial development.   DR.  ROWLEY:  No, because this is strictly university research.  That's an important issues as to whether as you are making new discoveries they're your intellectual property or reverts in some way to the source of the cell lines.  The fact that's not part of this is I think excellent.  I assume that as people come in with R01s that the cost of the cell lines and things can be included as costs within the grant.   DR. BALDWIN:   Oh, absolutely.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Again, just for my clarification.  I gather the answer to that question is that reversion applies only if these things are sold to commercial organizations and not to university researchers.  Is that right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.  Janet, are you complete for now?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Rebecca Dresser.   PROF. DRESSER:  I wanted to ask about a couple of things.  First, I was interested in how you decided about whether the informed consent requirement had been made in some countries far away.  Did you ask for just some documentation or how did you approach that?   DR. BALDWIN:  We had documentation from all of the sources.  We also had visits to a number of the sources.  All of the sources at the time the registry first posted had come and visited at the NIH, so we had discussed these things with them specifically.  We also have had visits to many of these other labs.  So it's not just a paper review.  It's primarily a case of them presenting the documentation which is always the case.  That's the heart of it.  But we have gone further than that.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  I understand.  The other thing I wanted to ask about is a little bit off the track but I understand that Dr. Gearhart recently got an award to work on stem cells from fetal tissue.   DR. BALDWIN:  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:   And that it went through a review process under the earlier NIH guidelines for stem cells which applied to both embryonic stem cells as well as fetal stem cells.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  So I understand that it went through a review process, and all the very detailed requirements were met.  I wondered if that was the same review group that reviewed that protocol as the one that was earlier put up during the prior Administration, the group the Janet Rowley mentioned this morning.   DR. BALDWIN:  You mean the composition of that review group.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:  No.   PROF. DRESSER:  How did that work?   DR. BALDWIN:  Let me explain what happened there.  We had these guidelines that covered both derivation from germ cells, from fetal tissue to generate the embryonic germ cell lines and also for embryos.  So the expectation had always been there would be more interest in the embryonic research at that point.  A group had been put together, but it had never actually met and functioned.   So when the President's policy came along that really superseded this whole section on embryo research.  So we rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  But the only rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  We left in place prohibited.  We left in place the fetal tissue side of it.  Now we had a very different creature because we knew the scope of that would be much narrower than was originally construed.   So we basically went back and rebuilt that process.  I mean, we didn't change any of the elements of review.  We didn't change any of the rigor.  But we did make that an internal NIH review.  Obviously dealing with appropriate conflicts of interest so that there was actually someone who would be on that group who would have been from the funding institute.  We had them absented from that review because of potential conflict.   But we took that group which was very mixed in terms of their science background, ethics background, et cetera, to review that proposal and to align it with the guidelines that were in place.  They did meet.  That was a public meeting.  We announced that in the Federal Register.  We did approve that project.   That process only begins when there is an application ready to be funded.  So someone comes in, we knew the Diabetes Institute was ready to make an award through their Beta Cell Consortium.  That's what prompted that meeting.  It happens in conjunction with the Center for Scientific Review Advisory Council meeting.   PROF. DRESSER:  So is the group all then NIH employees?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  I mean, one of the things we're interested in is if you're going to have review of some of these kinds of things who should be on the group.  I was just curious about that.  So you see this group more as going down the requirements and checking off to make sure everything was done as opposed to making some sort of ethical judgement about whether it's good enough to go forward.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, they're explicitly not to review the science again.   PROF. DRESSER:  I understand that.   DR. BALDWIN:  The science is reviewed on a separate track.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  So what is their role?   DR. BALDWIN:   Their role is to in fact look at the requirements which have many different components and to see whether the documentation that's presented to us is consistent with the requirements that we've put out there.  If you go back to your first question, it's really not terribly different from the review that we've done now on the materials submitted on the embryonic stem cells where we basically had the President's policy and it was our job which was in fact an NIH staff-level review as to whether the documentation was appropriate.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   We were trying to look for some parallelism there.   PROF. DRESSER:  But the initial proposal when this was going to cover both kinds of stem cells, I just know some people who I believe might have been put on the earlier group.  I know it wasn't all NIH.  It was more diverse.   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, no.  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:  So was that group seen more as making conceptual, ethical judgements more than this one is?   DR. BALDWIN:  That group really had a much larger task because that was where we were envisioning prospective establishment of embryonic stem cell lines.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   So they were going to really be reviewing the proposals or the strategies for developing those lines.  With the President's statement, that decision was made.  No prospective work, only retrospective.  It's only those lines that meet these criteria fixed in time and space.  I think we felt from the beginning that was going to be the much more challenging area and likely to be the volume of work would come in from the embryonic side.  But that was a judgement call on our part to bring that a little more in parallelism with what we were doing on the embryonic side.   PROF. DRESSER:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill Hurlbut.   DR. HURLBUT:  Apropos of that question in a slightly different perspective.  Are there provisions in the way things run now for opening to new apparent embryonic-type pluripotent stem cells that aren't from embryo sources?  For example, suppose that something like Catherine Verfaillie cells are shown to be truly pluripotent or maybe even totipotent.  Are there possible ways to review that which would allow new lines to be admitted if they didn't come from embryonic sources, either from above or below in the sense that by de-differentiating something that was differentiated or producing something that was slightly differentiated from below?  Do you see what I'm saying?   DR. BALDWIN:   But de-differentiating from an adult cell is not covered by this at all.  Maybe I'm not understanding your question.   DR. HURLBUT:   One of the hopes is that you'll be able to take an adult stem cell or maybe a somatic cell using the proper cytoplasmic factors and bring it down to pluripotency.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you could do that.  That would not be covered by this because you're not starting with an embryonic or a fetal line.   DR. HURLBUT:  My point is there are going to be some potential ethical questions around that, and they will be the equivalent of embryonic stem cells in a certain sense.  I know that they're sources not embryos, but they're potential is what's also in question.  Isn't it?   DR. BALDWIN:   Well, that's --   DR. HURLBUT:  I mean, you or the current policies would not approve for example the artificial creation of a zygote from above if you will.  You could add the cytoplasmic factors.   DR. BALDWIN:   I understood your question as to whether there would be specific requirements to generate an apparently pluripotent stem cell line starting from an adult cell.  We would not have coverage over that.  I think you're probably really asking other questions about what you would do with that cell after you got it, perhaps.   DR. HURLBUT:  Yes.  I'm trying to get at the moral question of whether the current provision has possibilities for reviewing new creations that are being worked on at this time.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill, I think if I understand what is here being implemented is something that is tied specifically to these authorized embryonic stem cell lines.   DR. BALDWIN:   Right.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  And that while there might be other things coming along that give rise to all kinds of myriad questions, that's not the bailiwick of this body.  Am I misunderstanding?   DR. BALDWIN:  No, you're absolutely correct.   DR. HURLBUT:  So they were not principles put in place.  It was the cell lines only.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  Here was for the first time authorization, permission to go ahead with these lines.  Nothing was in place to make that possible.  The NIH has had the pleasure and burden of making this happened as expeditiously as possible.  That's not without its difficulties and bugs.  That's  partly what we are learning about I think.  What happens with other things that come along, that would require different kinds of structures or might already belong to different kinds of places.  But that seems to be not the issue before us here.    Could I ask a question.  It's probably too early to tell because the number of proposals is still few.  But what are you hearing from the investigators who want to get up and running, granting that there might be the usual kinds of impatience between researchers and funding and assistant sources?  But with respect to the procedure, with respect to the obstacles, what are you hearing from the investigators who say at last?  Are there certain chronic obstacles at the moment?  If so, what are they?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I'd say the obstacles are not big obstacles, but they are certainly issues to deal with.  They are really the ones that I've mentioned.  You do have to deal with the intellectual property issues.  I mean, this is something and that's true for many products that are out there in research that you do have to deal with and MOU.  You do have to think about the intellectual property issues.   I haven't heard any particular concerns other than the anxiety around how much emphasis we'll place on preliminary data in a field that's going to be a little hard for them to develop preliminary data.  When we know that there are more lines being shipped then we're seeing applications for, it says to me that probably what is happening or what I am speculating is happening is that some investigators are going ahead, getting the lines, lines they know will be eligible for our funding, but working on them some before they apply to us for funding.  That's not anything we're imposing on anyone.   Most researchers like to put the best application forward that they can and knowing the difficulty in working with these lines, knowing that it's not simple may want to buffer themselves with some time before they actually come in with an application that goes into peer review.  That's really my speculation from bits and pieces that we've heard.   I think we have six intramural labs that have now received cells.  This is all really very new.  I mean, I don't know how people's cosmic time sense here is but for me this is very fast for this much of a roll-out of a very new, exciting, difficult, and high profile area of science.  I've been asked 100 times am I satisfied with the flow of applications, do I think there should more.  You always want to see more good applications.  Always.  It's not been a flood.  But given the circumstances, I'm not really all that surprised.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could I ask a follow-up?  To pick up on Dr. Rowley's question before on the question of the characterization of many of these lines and also on the -- Well, it really goes to the question of the purity of these lines as well.  Is there anything further that can be done through NIH, either on that or on the access questions?  Are you being asked by the investigators to lend a hand there?  Is there a hand to be lent?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, we're only partway through this implementation.  I mean, we haven't stopped the helping hand out there to work with these sources or to put funding out there for training activities.  This is certainly a high profile issue for us because we know that we're doing things that almost sound contradictory.  Somehow, I don't think they are.   One is we want to mainstream the process so the we stay connected to our fundamental principles and strategies of how we do business and use the tools.  Applications still have to go through peer review.  These things don't happen overnight.  On the other hand because it is such an exciting area of science, there really has been a concerted effort.  We have a contact group with all of the institutes involved.  We're working very closely with them to use every tool that we do have.    So we're trying to balance those two things.  I guess our instinct is that's the right strategy, but we have to keep the pressure on and we have to keep it a high profile issue for the NIH.  And we are.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Janet and then Frank.   DR. ROWLEY:  I'd like to follow on with two questions.  One of which relates to your earlier answer to me that there are about two dozen cell lines that have been characterized and again, how you would define characterization.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I think part of the problem is I don't think there is that clear of a definition.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   There's not tab six that is the clear definition of what everybody would accept as characterized.  That's the figure that we've been using of the ones where there is considerable information about the characteristics of the lines.   DR. ROWLEY:  But it's different probably for each one of the six.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is a little.   DR. ROWLEY:  So that there isn't a standard.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you're now challenging me to go back and see the extent to which we could line up some of that information and even use that network that we'll create with those sources as a way to drive it towards certainly some basic understanding.  But I don't think that exists right now.  I don't think we can say here are the six things you definitely should have done.   I think the field is moving pretty fast.  It's important for us not to foreclose anything.  I think when you're working in a new field one of the riskiest things for us to do as funders is to inadvertently foreclose or tighten it down too soon.   DR. ROWLEY:  I certainly agree with that.  As you say, it's as investigators use the lines they may also through their use find either additional features or additional problems that hadn't been appreciated before.  So all of that is going to be important information.  You indicated you were probably going to get at least some or all of the sources together to discuss these.  What kind of timeframe do you see for that?   DR. BALDWIN:  I really don't have a timeframe on that.  We've only made five of the Infrastructure Awards.  We still have more to deal with.  The new sources are very new to us.  It's just too early for me to say.   DR. ROWLEY:   So it would be more like a year from now rather than say six months.   DR. BALDWIN:  Probably in between that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had prompted me, I probably would have said maybe nine months.  But we do not have a specific date on that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.  I'd like to change gears if I can but also take advantage of your long association to senior level at NIH.  If you could help and I think this is related to the question that Rebecca was asking, we are aware that when Harold Varmus was Director of NIH he had a working group under Shirley Tillman looking at pluripotent human stem cells and reviewing some of the procedures to use that.  I think when you said that the focus of the present is narrowed down obviously the focus of that larger group under Shirley did include some derivation of embryo research using IVF.   One of the concerns of this group as well as others is how you would see a somewhat broader group either of the pluripotent stem cell review group for example that was envisioned in 1998 to 2000 that group was composed of ethicists and lawyers as well as scientists.  At least that's my impression.  I believe the membership was appointed by the Secretary of HHS.  I'm not positive about that, but that was my impression.  Whether such a review group would be an appropriate regulatory body to actually give responsibility to if for implementing and reviewing certain aspects or setting certain guidelines for embryonic stem cell research.   DR. BALDWIN:  What kind of guidelines do you have in mind?  Do you mean for areas of science that would be instituted?   DR. ROWLEY:   Well, my impression is that the working group under Dr. Tillman came up with a series of guidelines, some of which you've already incorporated or were incorporated into the embryonic stem cell lines that they had to be derived with donor consent and things of that sort.  The guidelines also have prohibited areas of research.   DR. BALDWIN:  They're still in place.  We did not rescind the prohibited areas of research.   DR. ROWLEY:  And our discussions here and the evolution of science in the last few years has really suggested that some of those prohibitions might be removed.  Then whether a review body of such as a broadly constituted body would look at the prohibited areas.  For example, the prohibition says no somatic cell nuclear transfer.  That's now an area that's been supported by the report from the National Academy of Sciences amongst other things.  Is that up to NIH and the Secretary to remove that prohibition or would there be a broader constituted group that might look at that?   The other thing that's prohibited is actually developing embryos specifically for research.  This is an issue that we've discussed back and forth.  At least some individuals, members of our Council, believe that it should be allowed under certain circumstances and with certain guidelines.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, you have certainly outlined a very difficult and evolving area of science and ethics.  The current group, the human pluripotent stem cell review group is definitely not envisioned as a group that would be taking on issues such as you described.  That is a group that is really there to address the adequacy of any plans to use fetal tissue.  The prohibitions that were in place in the original guidelines are still prohibitions that are compatible with administration policy.   So what we might do in the future is really not something that I could comment on here.  I can say that's not the kind of issue that would be remanded to that advisory group.  But we always have the capacity of putting in place other advisory groups if it's warranted.  We don't have any specific plans at this time.   Dr. Zahuni (PH) the current NIH Director certainly views this as a very important area of science and one that requires our due diligence and careful attention to what our steps should be.  So it's certainly not something that's going to get any less attention.  But I wouldn't be able to comment further than that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank Fukuyama.   PROF. FUKUYAMA:   A brief question.  Is there any possibility of these approved lines any of them dying out as a result of mistakes and handling or inexperience?  You said that they are very hard to keep going.   DR. BALDWIN:  That's very speculative.  I don't know.  Of all of the things I worry about in this line --   PROF. FUKUYAMA:  That's not it.   DR. BALDWIN:   That's not on my worry list.  Maybe you gave me something new to worry about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Robby George.   PROF. GEORGE:  Just very quickly.  A point of clarification.  In reply to Dr. Rowley's last question about who would have authority to lift or alter the prohibitions that she discussed such as somatic cell nuclear transfer, can you tell us again who's authority would be exercised there?  My understanding is that would require an action by the President or the Congress, not any advisory body.  Am I wrong about that?   DR. BALDWIN:  No.  You're not wrong.   PROF. GEORGE:  I'm right about that.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.  Anytime an issue is up for discussion there's frequently a desire to have an advisory group's comment on them.   PROF. GEORGE:   Absolutely.   DR. BALDWIN:  And we don't have a group in place that is doing that.  I'm not anticipating any changes in that.   PROF. GEORGE:   Right.  But apart from discussion or advise the policy --   DR. BALDWIN:  That's why I said those prohibitions are compatible with Administration, with our current policy.  So I'm not envisioning any changes.   PROF. GEORGE:  Is that your understanding as well, Dr. Kass?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  That's my understanding.  This is perhaps a strange question to put to you.  This group as you know has been asked by the President to monitor stem cell research and to think about offering guidelines for it.  We have spent a fair amount of our time on human cloning as you probably know.  But we have had presentations from Dr. Gearhart and Dr. Verfaillie.  We are trying as best we can to keep up with what is going on through the NIH.   From the point of view of your activities and what you hear from the researchers in-house and extramurally, are there things that you would like brought to this body that might deserve our special attention?  We've been trying to learn really about the implementation policy and finding out how easily and well are things moving.  Apart from the request that the President should become more liberal and allow more lines to flourish which I understand would be a perfectly natural opinion of the scientific community, within the policy as now stated or in relation to that policy that we would have to consider, are there not so much advise but questions and concerns that we would be remiss in not attending to from the point of view of the people that you speak with and the research that you're trying to help develop?   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't know whether this is a direct answer to your question.  I think what I see most need for right now is scientists just getting down to work with the lines that are available.  There are many questions that need an informed debate.  I think that debate will be better informed if it can come from not a speculation about what might happen and whether this is a good enough line or those work are enough but really more concrete, empirical evidence as to what happens when researchers get in there and work with these lines.   There are very different views out there as to are they enough, they're not enough, they're good enough, they're not good enough.  But they're a little hypothetical for my taste right now.  If they could be better grounded in experience we may find that people have terrible problems working with these lines.  We may find all kinds of terrible problems.  On the other hand, we may not.   Certainly if you look at the mouse ES experience, it started out with a lot of lines and it shook out to where there were a few that seemed to be the most valuable, most useful.  Will it be the same way in the human lines?  I don't know.  We won't know unless we get investigators willing to get in there and in the trenches and starting the work with them.   We're trying to put every conceivable mechanism out there to help that move along, but we still have to get the applications in from the research community.  I guess if you say what's the one thing that I most want to see happen, I think that's it because I just think it will just make the discussions the we could have six months, nine months, ten months, and 12 months from now so much more empirically grounded.  That would be my issue right now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, thank you.  Just a tiny addendum.  We are also trying to plan our own agenda for the remaining 17 or 18 months of our existence under the existing Executive Order.  I know there's no real answer to this question.  But order of magnitude.  If we wanted to be good monitors of this and of the research and how it's going along, do you think a year from now there would be stuff to monitor?   I mean, are we going to be able to do what we're supposed to do or are we at the end of this time say let the research go forward, we'd like to know what's happening?  And I'm not going to hold you to the answer.  But it matters to us I think in thinking about how to plan our own agenda what kind of time table we ought to be expecting to have some kind of data coming in.  I know it's absolutely unpredictable.   DR. BALDWIN:  Several things I do know.  One is this all takes longer than anyone thinks it does at the outset.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.  Rowley's Law.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had said anything less than 12 months to tap back in and see how implementation was going I would say I really think that's too soon.  I mean, if you look at a timeline from when these agreements are in places or when we've actually started to move money to a source for infrastructure support, we're measuring things in matters of weeks and months here.  Science just takes time.   In a year's time I think we'll certainly  have a better sense of the rate of applications.  We'll have a better sense of some people's early experiences in working with these lines.  But I would not want to over promise as to how definitive that will be.  Less than a year, I wouldn't do it.  In a year's time, I think it would be a fair question to say come back in a year or send someone back in a year and say how has it progressed and how many more investigators, what's the experience from those.   We'll have 13 Admin. Supplements.  Those are going to be experienced investigators who are probably our bellwether, our leading edge.  In a year's time, I think we'll have a much better feel for how difficult this has been for them or how quickly the sources given infrastructure support have gotten more common information available about their lines and whether in fact we have any lines that turn out just to not appear to work at all.  In a year's time, I think that would be a reasonable question to put to us.  I would hope I have some answers for you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, thank you.  Would you allow me one more?   DR. BALDWIN:  Sure.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  In connection with your own heavy responsibilities to this activity, is there someone as part of this project also keeping up with what is being done in the private sector on this activity to the extent to which that information is forthcoming?  In other words, if one wanted to say is there somebody at NIH who sits really in command of --   DR. BALDWIN:  Asking the private sector to tell us about what they're doing with their own money and not ours?  No.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I don't mean that.  But there are things that are published too.   DR. BALDWIN:   Yes, certainly.  We have been attentive to the meetings that occur.  We have staff at any of the national meetings or regional meetings, et cetera who are staying apprised of where the interesting work appears to be done.  I just have to draw that little line.  There's always work that's going on in the not federally funded sector that we don't always know about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Of course.   DR. BALDWIN:  There's nothing new about that.  But no.  We are definitely staying on top of where the developments are to the extent that we can.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Alfonso Gómez-Lobo.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  This is an information question.  Maybe it's out of your domain.  I know that at NIH quite a bit is being done on adult stem cell research.  Right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Now, is there any way of comparing volumes?  I mean, is there a lot more being done in adult stem cell research?   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, yes.  That's a much more established field, yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Okay.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, it looks like you have answered our questions for now very forthrightly, very fully, and very helpfully.  We're very glad.   DR. BALDWIN:   I'm happy to take any other questions that you would like to probably channel them to me.  E-mail them to me and I will try to get an answer for you if there is anything that I have not gone over.  Again, virtually every piece of information that we have put out there, every announcement, every piece of guidance, every helpful hint all is accessible on the website.  If you would prefer to receive that as hard copy, I'd be happy to pull together a briefing book and send it to you if the Members would like that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, we thank you very much.  Dr. Lee Zwanziger, would you stand please?  Lee is a research director on the staff and the person most interested in the stem cell aspect of our work.  I'd like at least you and she to say hello.  We can keep a communication open in that direction.   DR. ROWLEY:  I mean, I think that would be very helpful particularly to the extent that we would have some understanding of the cell lines that have been reasonably well characterized.  For example, are most of them derived in the U.S.?  Are most of them derived elsewhere?  Issues like that would certainly be helpful.   DR. BALDWIN:  You sort of challenged me to do an update on that.  So it gives me something to do.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  We are finished a little early.  Thank you very much, Dr. Baldwin.  Is Ted Friedman here?  If we started a little earlier, people could finish a little earlier.  I don't want people who are coming from out of town just to hear you talk miss the beginning.  But we are now ten after.  What if we reconvened at 2:30 p.m.?  Then we just finished a little earlier.  Would that be all right?  We'll take a break until 2:30 p.m.  Off the record.   (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 2:09 p.m. and went back on the record at 2:36 p.m.)                                                                                      Home   Site          Map   Disclaimers            Privacy Notice            Accessibility            Contact Us           NBAC            HHS            FOIA"

GX006-38-0081351	Federal CIO Council     XML Working Group         Wednesday, August 20, 2003 Meeting Minutes         State Plaza Hotel    2117 E Street, N.W    Washington DC 20037         Please send all comments or corrections to these minutes to Glenn Little at glittle@lmi.org.         Mr. Owen Ambur:           I think we better get started. I’ve been assured that a projector will show up shortly. I’m sure Ken [Sall] will appreciate it. I appreciate Ken being here. He’s here partly as filler, because Bob Haycock can’t get here until about 9:30. I appreciate Ken coming and giving us his presentation on Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG].          We usually start with introductions, and we give everyone an opportunity to introduce themselves and tell us a little about their interest in XML. I’m Owen Ambur of the [US] Fish and Wildlife Service, and I co-founded this Working Group in 2000.         [Introductions]         [Editor’s note: The meeting room was not supplied with a working projector. The speakers spoke from their slides, but were unable to project them for the audience. The speakers tailored their talks accordingly, thus the discussion does not necessarily follow the slide order.]          Mr. Ambur::    Ken still doesn’t have a projector, so I guess he’ll give do a little song and dance, and hopefully the projector will show up in time to show us what SVG looks like.              Ken Sall    SiloSmashers    Scalable Vector Graphics         Slide 1    [Title slide]:    As you  can’t  see, the presentation is entitled ‘Capabilities of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). I’d like to stick with the presentation, so I’ll do all the text-based slides first, then hopefully show you the visual material all at once. It’s not the way I would have preferred, but it’ll do.         Slide 2    [What is SVG?]:    This is not a tutorial on SVG. It’s just about its capabilities—what you can do, and why it’s important. SVG is a non-proprietary format. In some sense, it’s a replacement for bitmapped graphics. It’s arguably the replacement for [Macromedia] Flash [ http://www.macromedia.com/ ]. It occupies a different niche. It’s capable of 2-D resolution and media-independent graphics in a text-based format. Because it’s XML, it integrates with major XML specifications and Cascading Stylesheets [CSS], and scripting and animation are capabilities with SVG.          SVG consist of three types of objects:     1.        SVG shapes (anything defined by a path; straight lines or curves, and geometric shapes.)       Text      3.        Images.         Slide 3    [What is SVG? (continued)]:    So, because it’s text-based and XML-based, the SVG can be generated on the fly, from a database or an application. It’s really powerful. When you think about it, it means that GIS [Geographic Information Systems] applications can generate it as they are doing their processing. The [Open] GIS Consortium [ http://www.opengis.org/ ] and GML [Geography Markup Language,  http://opengis.net/gml/ ] are doing things on the fly.         Because it’s text within SVG, as opposed to XML tags, it’s not bitmapped. It’s searchable, indexable, selectable, copyable, and accessible (which gets at Section 508 considerations [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act,  http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm ]). It integrates well with server-side technology. It can be transformed, translated, styled, and reused. By “reused,” I mean that you can define it once and reference it in multiple locations.         Some of the popular features are things like filter effects, alpha masks, and template objects—things that graphics people are familiar with. In terms of vendor support, I’ll read the list. SVG supports: Adobe, BitFlash, Canon, Corel, CSIRO, Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, ILOG, KDDI, Nokia, Openwave, Schema Software, Sharp, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments, and Zoomon. Missing from that list is two big companies that start with “M,” and one that starts with “I”.         Mr. Ambur:    I’d like to mention that the folks on the teleconference have an advantage over those of us here in the conference room, because Ken’s presentation is available on the [XML.gov] website and they can view it there.         Mr. Sall :         Slide 4    [General Vector Graphics Advantages]:    There are two advantages of SVG: one is the kind of advantage you get from it being vector graphics, period; the other is one that relates to it being XML. Let’s talk a little about that first group—vector versus bitmap. An SVG file is a small file, so it downloads faster. It’s a description of how to draw something, as opposed to the actual bits. It’s device-independent. It targets more devices; has better printing capabilities; can pan; can zoom in on details that aren’t initially visible; you don’t get the pixilation that you get on JPEG; it has a grouping capability; layering; hierarchy; and dynamic generation.         The good new is that most big vendors of graphics editors already have an export capability for SVG built in. Corel does that, right?         Mr. J.D. Sylvestri:    Yes. Corel has done it since [Wordperfect] Version 11.         Slide 6    [XML Family of Specifications: Advantages for SVG]:    Now I’ll talk about the advantages based on XML. We have validation. At first you might think that it doesn’t make much sense, but there arc cases where it might. Integration with Web pages: because you can integrate with XHTML [Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, [ http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ ], you can use a document model to script events, so it has an interactive capability. It has text labels and descriptions; it’s directly searchable; it can be indexed by a search engine. It’s very powerful. You don’t want to rely on pictures you can store in a database. You’d have to rely on a file name. Now you have a whole format that’s wide open. You have the image and the metadata. It’s all in there, and directly searchable.          There’s a title tag. That’s perfect for 508 compliance, because any graphic can have a title. Much like XHTML, where you have an attribute, this is an element. You can link from any part of an image, based on XLink [ http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking ] and XSLT. And, you can reference bitmap graphics. You can do complex animations and transformations, and SMIL [Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language,  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/ ] gives you the capability for better timing in your animations.         CSS you can use to change the look of SVG:    ·           at run-time, or    ·           by a new Stylesheet.         The other thing is fonts. It’s not limited to what the device has. You can define fonts in the SVG.          I’m going to skip the graphic, skip the code sample, and skip “Apache.” [slides 7-14].          Slide 15    [SVG Converter Applications]:    Thinking of what you want to get, and what you can do with it—there are converter applications where you can convert to or from SVG. I’ll go over those, and see what you can do with this.         You can extract text out of SVG with XSLT [XSL Transformations, [ http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/ ]    Apache [ http://www.apache.org/ ] has components that support SVG-to-PDF [Portable Document Format,  http://www.adobe.com/ ]. There are also a Perl [ http://www.perl.org/ ] script and a Python [ http://www.python.org/ ] script that do SVG inside of PDF. I’m not sure how it works. I haven’t tried it. PDF-to-SVG is going in the opposite direction , with something called Free SVG. On the slide, all the bullets have links to information about it.         Then there’s SVGmaker, which allows one to take [Microsoft] Office files and convert directly to SVG. You can do [Microsoft] PowerPoint, SVG, [Microsoft] Word, etc.          Mr. Rick Rogers:    The underlying system of Windows is SVG, so you can do anything with SVG that you can print in Windows.         Mr. Sall:    I didn’t know that. Theirs works so smoothly, it’s great.          Ms. Theresa Yee:    Can you please repeat the statement?         Mr. Sall:    Rick said the native Operating System of Windows has SVG capability, so any application can do what I said the SVGmaker can do.         On the XML.gov website, next to the PowerPoint presentation, is the SVG version of the same talk, produced by SVGmaker. You can see that it’s visually identical to PowerPoint. For some reason it doesn’t preserve links. I’m not sure why it does that.         You can also go from SVG to bitmap graphics like PNG and JPEG. Sun [Microsystems,  http://www.sun.com/ ] has software for an SVG slide toolkit from about two years ago. The idea is, you can think of SVG as a graphical user interface to your XML data.         I thought we’d talk about, not what’s in the picture, but about XSLT. Say you    have XML sales data or any numeric or text data, and you want a bar or pie chart or any graphic that represents the information. You can use XSLT to transform the XML data to SVG. Now you have a visual display.         [A projector was provided, but it would not illuminate the signal.]         So in terms of XSLT, it can do transformations to SVG, because we know it can swap in a new XSLT stylesheet, and can get many different views of the data. They can also do DOM [Document Object Model] scripting, which is a run-time proposition (as opposed to a transformation, which isn’t). There are a number of editors that natively support SVG, and some that output to it.         Slide 17    [Recent (2003) SVG Applications]:    There’s one in particular, which I’ve not looked at, other than to know it’s out there, called SALT [Speech Application Language Tags,  http://www.saltforum.org/ - About%20SALT ]. It gives you an interactive speech interface to the graphics. Imagine a speech interface to graphics!         Mr. Matthew McKennirey:    Do you have any examples of how it’s used currently?         Mr. Sall:    That’s actually where I was going. Some of the converters gave us an idea. I mentioned the GIS Consortium use with GML. Many map applications want to show one called “Smart Map.” Picture an application that has animation, with a toolkit that pops up.         There are interesting chess applications; not the level of application you’re thinking of, but it gives you an idea of what can be done. There are three kinds of chess applications: There’s one that can move the pieces, but has no knowledge of chess. There’s one that’s animated. You can go through a sequence of moves, and show how the game was played. There’s one that does rules-checking. If you make an incorrect move, it knows what to do.         Mr. McKennirey:    I was thinking more in terms of applications in federal agencies.         Mr. Sall:    Rick, you used it in the Census?          Mr. Rogers:    Ken, you said SVG allows you to tie into other XML applications. You can also try to use it as a user interface. One way is using SVG as an interface.          Mr. Sall:    Rick mentioned that XForms [ http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/ ] and SVG are a good mix because each complements the other.         [Mr. Sall worked on resolving the no-image issue with the projector.]         Mr. Ambur:    Why don’t we go to Bob [Haycock], and get to the projector presentations later? You mentioned voice or speech interface. Obviously, that has great implications for accessibility.          Hopefully we’ll get back to Ken’s presentation later. Ken, I appreciate your taking the time to brief us on SVG. Now let’s get to Bob Haycock of the FEAPMO [Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office]. Bob’s going to brief us on the status of the Data and Information Reference Model [DRM,  http://www.feapmo.gov/feaDrm.asp ].         Mr. Bob Haycock    FEAPMO    Data and Information Reference Model          One thing I’ve learned in this gig of the last 14 months is, be prepared for anything, I’m thinking, while watching Ken, that one unrecognized skill set is the ability to switch in a presentation seamlessly. I’m quite impressed         I didn’t bring a file to put on the overhead,. I wasn’t sure of the facilities. I brought hardcopy. Hopefully there’ll be enough. I’ll send Owen the file. I can only stay for about half an hour, and I apologize for that.         First of all, thanks for having me. We tried to do this a month ago, but the schedule didn’t work out. I recognize some faces here from previous meetings. I’m Bob Haycock, with the FEAPMO. I’ve met some of you. I’ve been working on the FEA for about 16-17 months. We’ve just about got all the reference models done and out, as you’re aware. We released the second version of the Business Reference Model [ BRM,  http://www.feapmo.gov/feabrm2.asp ] a couple months ago, and the first version of the Service Component [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaSrm2.asp ] and Technical Reference [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaTrm2.asp ] Models at the same time. We have a 99.99% complete draft of the Performance Reference Model [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaPrm2.asp ] in agency hands now. It’s not published, because it hasn’t been approved and signed by the director of OMB. What will go out publicly, though, is in agency hands now. The last model, the Data and Information Reference Model, is a work in progress now.          What I’m going to talk about today is where we stand at this point in time. It’s been a long road. We started in January to think about it seriously. We put together some offsite meetings to brainstorm through this. Brand [Niemann] was there too. We had about three of those meetings, and ended up to where we were a month and a half ago. We provided that to the AIC [Architecture and Infrastructure Committee of the CIO Council] in June for their review and comment and feedback to us. We’ve since received it, and we’re working with the AIC in that process as well. The Industry Advisory Council [IAC,  http://www.iaconline.org/ ] has done one white paper on the DRM [ http://www.iaconline.org/documents_presentations/2003/030528_IAC_EA_SIG_Information_and_Data_Reference_Model_Body.pdf ], and a lot of that is in there as well. We’re not there yet. Today it’s a work in progress, showing what the current thinking is now. I have about 20 slides. I’ll skim through a few, and focus on a few. I apologize to the phone folks for any inability to track along with my talk.         Slide 3:    Slide 3 shows the FEA. I won’t go into it. I’m sure you’ve seen it ad nauseum.          Slide 4:    Slide 4 forms the basis for why we’re doing this; what’s the purpose for a DRM? The situation in the federal government cries out for something like a DRM. How do we do that? How do we think about a data architecture across the entire federal government, and make something useful and viable and effective? That’s what we’ve been struggling through. Hopefully, we’re getting there. The primary issues and barriers are:    1.        No common framework to describe data and information across multiple agencies. The purpose of the DRM is data sharing across lines of business, the lines being major functional categories that encompass many agencies.    2.        There’s no definition for the handshake, or partnering of information exchange and sharing. How do we set that up?    3.        The next one is, that diffused content is very difficult to manage, get one’s arms around.    4.        Information is not classified well. If there’s a bottom-line objective for the DRM, it’s to describe the information in a consistent way that can be used across multiple agencies.    5.        Without a common reference, data is easier to duplicate than integrate. That’s one issue that Mark Forman [OMB Associate Director for E-Government] had; we create too much duplication, because there’s no place to find out what’s out there, so we create it again and again. That’s why the ability to interoperate and share is the key. That’s where we started with this. The result of that is pictorially laid out in Slide 5.         Slide 5:    While there’s some data-sharing going on (and there is in specific functions, either between federal or star agencies), at a working level, people find a way around it. They always have. It exacerbates the problem of needing an efficient way to get at this, so that people can just get the data and focus on the systems they’re developing.         Slide 6:    This is where we’re at now. It’s different from what we showed at the agency briefing in June. We’re still thinking through this construct. The changes we made in the model are the direct result of feedback from agencies in the June briefing. The contributions were excellent. There were thoughtful things that people submitted. Essentially, we’ve organized the DRM into two major categories: one is the description, and one is the data itself. One puts the business context on the data, so then you can call it (our term) an “information package,” associated with a business process or activity. That’s the link we didn’t have before.          The DRM provides:    1.        A framework for vertical and horizontal information sharing,    2.        A framework that lets agencies build and integrate systems that leverage data from within or outside the agency domain, and     3.        A framework that allows sharing opportunities for better decisions.         Mr. Sall:    Data Super-Type [from slide]. What is that?         Mr. Haycock:    I’ll get into it in a little bit—in two or three slides.         Slide 7:    I think we’re finally at the point where we can understand how the DRM integrates with the other four reference models; how they work together. Let me mention a couple other items to give you a sense of what we’re thinking. What’s going on is, we also initiated, through the AIC of the CIO Council, an initiative to look at bringing down the granularity of the BRM to lower levels. If you’re familiar with the BRM, it’s pretty broad. It’s talking about things like National Defense or law enforcement. Sub-functions are more granular, but still broad. It’s difficult to do anything other than bucket things. It’s good for OMB, but it doesn’t tell us whether people have the same process. At that level, we get into arguments about “my process is different.” We know nothing unless we get to a lower level of granularity, so we need to think about how to approach it across the federal government. We’re looking at coming up with another “model” for the attributes used to describe processes at different levels, down to an IDEF {Intermediate Data Exchange Format] Level 0 process. Start to define those processes in similar ways, and compare the process. Hopefully we’ll begin to tie data and information packages to those processes and places in the process. We’re trying to put meat on the bones a little.          The second piece is a security profile for the FEA: how should we think about security for those five models? It tracks closely to those business processes: what are the risks with those activities? Then you can judge the risk and security needs at that point. You can look at the vulnerability of the data, and identify your security mechanism across the models, the security patterns for different businesses in the process. That’s the direction we’re going in. Let’s turn to Slide 8.         Slide 8:    This is the framework. We need a different name. If you know one or can think of one…that’s why the security profile is called a profile. Right now, we’re calling it the DRM Framework. Essentially, it’s the structure of the DRM. As Brand remembers, we debated this a whole bunch. We decided that the main thing is to describe data in a standard, consistent way. That’s the bottom line. It’s based primarily on [International Standards Organization] ISO 11179. We also played with ebXML [Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language,  http://www.ebxml.org/ ]. We want to describe it in a consistent way across the federal government at a certain level (not necessarily at the data element level), then put business context around it—what happens at the top, like “Subject Area” and Super-Type. The subject in this case is public health. It’s based on that. We can put context on those packages that we can put together in the business exchange. We can put a process together of what goes into it, then we can have a consistent process, relate it to the business process, and we can move forward.         So that’s the bottom line, where we’re at right now. This is the key slide. Everything flows from that.         Mr. James Feagans:    We’ve gotten through putting together an Enterprise Architecture plan. We’re right in synch with this. As a matter of fact, as I was saying to Owen this morning, the “train is leaving” October 1. We’re perfect with this. We really need to do that.         Mr. Haycock:    We’re right there, right now.         Mr. Feagans:    We’re using the FEA, so we’re right there.         Mr. Arie Brish:    The time element of the data—one agency may change something, and another agency might need something from the first. There might be some time delay between the change and the usage. Is there something in the model that relates to it?         Mr. Haycock:    Not in the model, but in the implementation of the model. That’s the key issue. How do you govern it?          Unknown participant:    There has to be a steward, a…         Mr. Haycock:    That’s the hard part. The IAC paper on the DRM (I don’t see Michael Lang here), that’s what he’s getting into—how do you govern around a federated process?         Mr. Brand Niemann:    In the pilot, we did differentiated between design time and run time. What you do at a moment, and what you do at run time. The metamatrix and the XML Collaborator [ http://www.blueoxide.com/Pages/xmlcollaborator.html ] added to what Michael had done with the XML schema, not only for integrating, but for exchanging data in a real world situation.         Mr. Haycock:    Brand’s been out front. I think we’re beginning to catch up, where we have a model, and we’re going to pilot it over time. I would not think we’re going to go out to agencies in the 2006 process and say, “Give us all your data.”         Mr. Feagans:    We’re approaching it with a revolutionary process. We use COPs [Communities of Practice] for the department to begin with.         Mr. Haycock:    I talk about it in here. We have a conceptual approach. We begin with COPs. One of the lines of business that fell out of last year’s budget process is health. Martha Chapman of HHS [Department of Health and Human Services,  http://www.hhs.gov/ ] is working on it.    I have four or five here that we can work with.         Mr. Ambur:    You commented that people’s eyes are glazing over but, to the contrary, I think you’re making good connections here. People  are  with you.         Mr. Haycock:    My head was spinning at first, but it’s starting to clear. We had a lot of heads in this.          Slide 9:    This talks about the Community of Practice approach—how we’re attacking this. We want to work off of the good work of others, leverage as much as we can. We’ve had a lot of others’ thinking in here.         Slide 11:    We touched on that [DRM Implementation Strategy]. I won’t get into it. We hope to have something that begins to intersect data across multiple agencies for specific business aspects, to put metrics on it, performance service aspects.         Mr. Ambur:    Your 12 th  slide depicts boxes delineating portions of the DRM attributable to HHS, USDA, DOI and DOE, with overlaps among them.    I think of the boxes as being XML schema for each agency, with the overlaps depicting data elements that are common across more than one agency.         Mr. Haycock:    I think I’ll leave it there in your hands…leave it as how we get to the interaction layer and schema. We’re going to run out of time here. We can talk about next steps here. I’ll talk a little about Slide 17.         Slide 17:    We talked about problems, issues and challenges. Slide 17 talks about the benefits of the approach, good stuff. We’ve been working on the release document for this model. The goal is to release it in draft form by October 6. We’re driving to that date right now. We may have even three documents, or two (with one having two parts). First would be the model. Second would be how you use it. We’re talking from a business standpoint, not from a technical standpoint. For the business owner or program manager, what’s in for them, what they get out of it. We’re thinking of the same package for the other four reference models also. If I’m an Assistant Secretary [of a federal Department], and government-wide we’re putting a billion dollars into the FEA, what do I get out of it? So it’s the business benefits and technical benefits. Clearly there are technical benefits. Everyone knows that, but there are a lot of business benefits also. One is, it’s difficult (if not impossible) to secure data if you don’t know where it is. If it’s all over government, you might not know where all of it [a complete set] is. If we can manage it in a consistent way, then we can start the security on it. I think that’s a major benefit. It supports electronic interoperability of information. When you get in the development world, you have all these interfaces. You’re trying to move data, and you have to find out what’s changing everywhere else. Hopefully this will facilitate that, so we don’t end up with a lot of XML schema. It provides clear data ownership and stewardship…Who’s responsible for managing and maintaining it? It’ll make sure it’s up to date.         Mr. Ambur:    You used the word “stewardship” and I want to comment favorably on the use of that term.    One of my pet peeves is the misuse of the word “ownership.” When we’re talking about federal resources, the owners are the taxpayers. By contrast, when bureaucrats think they own something, they don’t seem to feel the need to consult with or listen to anyone else. Thus, I strongly encourage the word “stewardship” – since it more accurately reflects the fact that we, the people of government, are merely temporarily entrusted with problems and opportunities on behalf of “We the People of the United States of America.”         Mr. Haycock:    I agree. I’m a federal and state steward.         Mr. Ambur:    We’re only here a short time. We’re stewards of the citizens’ trust.         Mr. Haycock:    Then the technical benefits are: a common vocabulary and data standardization, and it facilitates the use of electronic registries and repositories. We have to have them at some time. I was hoping that Marion [Royal] was here. We’ve been talking about bringing together all the registries; essentially have a one-registry concept, probably a federation of registries in consistent way to manage.         Mr. Ambur:    Regarding registries, Marion gave me some bad news recently. He said Congress cut funding for the XML registry from GSA’s budget.         Mr. Haycock:    Just the House [U.S. House of Representatives].         Mr. Lew Sanford:    We’re working to get it restored.         Mr. Ambur:    I’m pleased to hear that.         Mr. Haycock:    The last slides talk about people we’ve been working with over the last seven or eight months, and talk about the next steps in the process. By this Friday, we are finalizing revisions in the slide deck we presented to agencies in June. We’ll put that back out to the AIC committees for another look. We’re working on a subject area analysis. We’ve requested agencies, through the AIC, to provide us with the major subject areas in their agencies. In the week of September 5, we’ll finalize the release documents, release them to agencies for their review, and probably have another “all hands” briefing at the White House Conference Center. Actually, we’ll probably have another on October 5. We’re looking to release the first version by early October. Probably in the same time frame, we’ll talk to agencies about pilot efforts, and say, “Do them between January and February of next year.”         Mr. Mike Lubash:    Have you ever considered the use of the term “concept” for the steward? I argue that “concept” is something people can agree to when I try to mediate standards. You can plug in a mediation routine that allows you to plug-and-play the standards, so you can mediate irrespective of the standards.         Mr. Haycock:    I absolutely would consider it. I encourage you to contact me. That is an issue: where do you stop? Clearly, we won’t get down to the data level. We need to reconcile that at some level. We need to determine where.         Mr. Ambur:    I wouldn’t suggest that it is exactly what we need in this context, but there’s a precursor to the subject area analysis of the DRM.    The government Blue Pages are supposed to provide an overview of all of the functions of government, in terms that are commonly understood by the public.    Since the focus of the Blue Pages is the local, printed telephone directories, it may not be as comprehensive as it should be in the context of an online directory of all of the functions of government.    However, with respect to the potential to share data and the need to avoid reinventing the wheel, the list of functions identified in the Blue Pages should be considered for reuise as the DRM is being specified.         Mr. Brish:    Is industry participating through the Industry Advisory Council?         Mr. Haycock:    The CIO Council has a good relationship with them. They’ve turned out lot of good work working with and through the CIO Council’s Architecture and Infrastructure Committee (AIC). The IAC is helping on governance component, architecture, and emerging technology. At this point, it’s a very productive relationship.          And that’s about it. Thank you for having me.         Mr. Ambur:    Thank you, Bob. We’re a little ahead of schedule. Let’s take a look at where we’re at with the projector. [inquiries as to working projector]         The projector is still not projecting, so let’s go ahead and take a  break.          Break         Mr. Ambur:    I might mention again that there’s an attendance roster circulating. It’s on the table in front of Arie. Arie, if you would hold it up?    If you haven’t already signed in and would like your presence noted, either initial it or add you name to the list. I think we had a few people who came in after we introduced ourselves this morning, so if you’d like to introduce yourself and indicate your interest in XML, now would be an appropriate time.         [Introductions]         Our next speakers are Susie Adams and Carolyn Brubaker from Microsoft. They’re here not in a Microsoft capacity, but as advisors to OMB on the OMB Exhibit 300, which used to be the Capital Asset Plan and Budget Justifiation but is now known at the Capital Asset Plan and Business Case.    It is the document all agencies are required to submit in the budget process to get funding for any capital investment included in the President’s budget request.    So it’s a very important document. Last month, we had a presentation on [OMB] Exhibit 53, which is a subset of the Exhibit 300 data focusin solely on major IT investments (as opposed to other kinds of capital investments made by federal agencies). Exhibit 300 is related to the FEA, in the sense that all IT investments should be consistent with the FEA.    So those are the linkages, and when I think about linkages, I think about the potentials of XPath, XPointer, XLink, and related XML standards.              Susie Adams & Carolyn Brubaker    Microsoft    Revised/Updated XML Schema for [OMB] Exhibit 300    XFDL Overview         Ms. Brubaker:    I’m going to talk about the business need and how we got into the program, and Susie will talk about the technical detail of the schema.         We were approached by OMB. They had a business need to collect all the data for the IT process from the OMB 300 for submission in XML format. For Fiscal Year ‘05 planning, they wanted it all in XML format. Some agencies are not doing that, and some Departments have not been doing it, so there was a flurry of activity in finding out how to do it. They asked us to come up with a technology that could collect, organize, and disseminate data in XML format. Susie will talk about why she chose what she chose.         We did a survey and an assessment. We worked closely with OMB staff to come up with the right, simple solution. It’s been a learning process because of the short time. We created a document, or solution, that will be posted to a website today, for small and midsized agencies to use. That’s the history. The key thing is that there was a defined business need, and we worked closely with OMB to make sure the business processes were covered, on a tight timeline.         Mr. Niemann:    What will be posted? The schema, or document, or what?         Ms. Adams:    I’ll talk about that. I’ll go back to the history, and last year, because there are a lot of things involved.         Ms. Brubaker:    I don’t want this to be a Microsoft thing, but I’m with the EGov group within Microsoft Federal. We’re trying to look broadly across government and the EGov initiatives and reusing technology, and trying to identify how Microsoft solutions can complement the initiatives and the FEA. Just tracking, staying knowledgeable, communicating out the word.         Mr. Ambur:    As I said, they’re here in a role supporting OMB, but on September 29, Betty Harvey of the DC Area XML User’s Group [ http://www.eccnet.com/xmlug/ ] and I are coordinating an XML authoring/editing tool forum. The purpose of that event is to give vendors an opportunity to show users – particularly government folks and Betty’s stakeholders – how they are making it as easy as possible to author and edit valid XML instance documents.    That would be appropriate for forum in which for Microsoft to demonstrate its XML authoring/editing software and the Exhibit 300 would be a good to document to use in such a presentation.         Mr. Niemann:    The Intelligence Community Metadata Working Group [ http://www.xml.saic.com/icml/ ] is embarking on a year-long effort to do that. They’re going to produce a lab test and some kind of report. They’re working on the Harris Watch List schema. I’ll provide it to you as suggested content for September 29, to position that and move on with this other activity, so I’ll post some information on that and encourage these other vendors to participate.         Ms. Adams:    A little history: last year we were working with OMB, in a pro bono type of effort. They came to us early-on in the process, and said they’d like to automate submission of the OMB 300 and 53 process. They didn’t know whether they wanted XML, so we sat down with them and white-boarded, and said they should put it in XML. They tried to make a schema, to replicate the data in a schema. They hired Booz to help them implement. Working with folks like Marion, we stopped and went down the XBRL [eXtensible Business Reporting Language,  http://www.xbrl.org/ ] path, because the thought was that XBRL was a good grammar to replicate. We ran into several speed bumps at the end, because XBRL is not the most appropriate grammar for the data we were trying to collect.         Mr. Lubash:    Is this document anywhere? Because it’s an issue that’s growing: should we use base XML or XBRL, because is there a marketing effort taking place? We want to make an educated decision.         Ms. Adams:    We don’t care. If it’s valid, that’s all we want. We’re not trying to get into the grammar space. We actively support the standards, so we can build products that support either. We use XBRL, but do we recommend it? Not really.          Unknown participant:    XBRL serves an important niche. For repurposing, it’s probably a good choice, but if you’re the creator and it has to be embedded in your applications, it’s not necessarily a good choice.         Mr. Sylvestri:    Can we have part of this for the September 29 meeting?          Mr. Ambur:    It’s wide open.         Ms. Adams:    We looked at it fairly late, and in one day we had to create a schema. It’s difficult, because only ITIPS [Information Technology Investment Portfolio System,  http://www.usace.army.mil/itips/ ] folks are going to be able to submit. So we’re working with Booz to construct and submit, then parse and get it into a database. Prior to this, there were truckloads of paper, with people sitting and keying it in.         Was the first one reusable? Pretty? Did it have data types? No, but it was good for the first effort. To OMB, it was light years better than anything they’d seen, and to agencies, to let them accept and put it into the database, the time saved on their end was huge from prior years. They came back to us this year late in the game (there was no kick-off meeting until late June), to construct the schema. We ran into a number of roadblocks. We had some assumptions. By September 8, their back-end systems had to be able to process and accept this data, so we had a real-world business problem to solve, but we also wanted to improve the schema. So the assumptions we made were:    ·           Valid XSD,    ·           Make some modifications, and clean up the schema without reinventing the wheel, and    ·           Put data types in there as best we could, and put some constraints in there—make it more restrictive.    Before, we had no valid data types. It also didn’t support HTML in the last version, so people were cutting from Word documents and putting it into HTML. It’s the same this year. We focused on cleaning it up from last year, and keeping it simple, because not every agency has an XML guru. We’re getting calls from almost every agency on how to get their documents into XML. The second approach was, we used    InfoPath [ http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/infopath/default.asp ] to put a free tool out there mainly to make our job easy, because if it’s not there, we and OMB are not going to get valid XML, so that’s the main reason why we put it out there. So if you’re in a bind, you can use it, because you know it generates valid information.         The [OMB Circular,  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/03toc.html ] A-11 guide and the related guidance are not ready. We had some people helping us with that.         Unknown participant:    How many data elements?         Ms. Adams:    I don’t know.         Mr. Sall:    At least 389.         Ms. Adams:    If you look at the A-11 guidance, it’s not always clear. Lots of folks can construct valid documents based on many of these standards, but you have to merge that with what OMB wants to see. They don’t understand XML or data types. They’re used to Corel. What do you do? Give a “string?” If the string is 500 elements, it blows up. It’s very complicated. We took a lot of issues. OMB gave us time, but it takes a lot of time to make it simple enough to be usable if you’re not an XML guru.         I have my bullet-proof vest on today, because the schema has changed multiple times. OPM [Office of Personnel Management] looked at it through their information platform. Booz Allen has had the schema for a month now. The problem is, there’s no data, because the guidance won’t be finished until the end. They’re just beginning to go through this process, and again, not being a subject matter expert, and OMB not being XML experts, it’s hard to find every single issue. We’ve found some. Ken Sall found some. Others are more about style. Should the OMB schema conform to the [IAC] white paper, and the Developer’s Guide published by the XML Working Group? In a perfect world, yes. Our goal was to put some restrictions on it, and given the time and our task, we have to help these agencies get the data to them. We don’t anticipate it to be easy. Our job is to make it as simple as possible. I’d love to get the schema out to everyone in this room and talk about it for months. We’re going to recommend that to OMB, but in the current process, as-is today, it’s frustrating, because we can’t get everyone involved. As Bob [Haycock] said, it’s still evolving. Everyone has great ideas, but when we have to have a working system by September 8, we have to say, “This is where we go” and move forward. That’s why it’s the way it is today. We have to start and go ahead, and let it evolve.         Mr. Sall:    The InfoPath tool—it’s good news, but I’m wondering whether people have to have Office 2003 to use it?         Ms. Adams:    As it stands today, the beta version of Office is freely available on the Web. Do you have to install InfoPath? Yes, but you can install it separately.         Mr. Sall:  So agencies will be allowed to use InfoPath software?         Ms. Adams:    It’s officially shipped in October.         Mr. Sall:    You said September 8th is the initial submission date. The timing is a little off.         Ms. Adams:    That’s the current state of where everything is. We’re diligently working with OMB to finalize the schema. I apologize, but it’s not yet final. We’re still working, and we hope to have some something by about the end of the week         Mr. Rogers:    Could you talk about lessons learned on your integrating a new   XML stream into an existing legacy system?         Ms. Adams:    Our existing system from last year was a server page, but because the database was outdated, we had to rebuild it this year. The format and the way the relationships were represented prior to now has changed so much that we decided to go with a new structure. It’s more elegant than last year’s. It’s not complicated, because there are only 360 data elements. It doesn’t take much time for developers to get them into their database or architect the database.         I wouldn’t call it a business process. They’re scoring, but they won’t let us go there yet. Right now, we’re focusing on the data analytics of it. We want the data in the right format, so we can slice and dice it without needing a developer to run the queries. We’re trying to throw it into a multi-dimensional database, to be able to look at the information. They get the information, slice and dice it, and present it to Congress. Our job is to help them do that. Next year, we hope the changes will not be as radical; we hope to map from the new to the old schema, and have the data go in. We have a product on the back end called BizTalk Server [ http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/ ] that lets us do that, so we can take the XSLT and map it to last year’s. We didn’t do it this year, because the data need to be scrubbed.         Mr. Ambur:    I think the data changes won’t be as radical from year to year in the future, but there will always be changes to the guidance. That will entail changes to the database, so we need to make the system readily supportive of change.         Ms. Adams:    Everyone thinks XML is the silver bullet. We set it up to receive any XML document and hopefully map it, and look at information from the State to the federal government. The federal government says, “You have to give us the data ‘somehow.’    With the Department of Education, we got flat form files and all kinds of formats. So the idea is, you define the schema and allow people to map to it. Whatever schema you want to base your exchange on. You’ll never get everyone to exchange the same way. If you allow them to choose, you get more data. If you demand one way, you make it harder for them. We’re probably light years away from one format, because it would have to be a mandate. In the real world, you need the production system today, and you get as much data as possible.         Unknown participant:    Can you talk about data sharing? The IRS is in the process of developing schemas for tax returns as mandated by Congress. A committee under [ANSI, American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee,  http://www.x12.org/x12org/index.cfm ] X12 made up of revenue partners from States and others can negotiate schemas, because States need the data from the IRS, and they need to send them to the IRS, so they’re negotiating what’s done, so the IRS can use what’s done by the States, and developers have a common schema to work from to provide for the taxpayers.          Ms. Adams:    That’s great, but it’s hard to get everyone to use it. If you can mandate it, great, but the federal government can’t mandate to States.         Mr. Ambur:    What we should be aiming for is a good forum for that negotiation to take place to achieve the required degrees of consensus.         Unknown participant:    The Tigris Committee [ http://www.tigris.org/ ] is meeting on that next month. Sometimes the IRS accommodates it, and some times not, but it’s worked out.         Mr. Kevin Williams:    Something you’re saying brought something to mind: with respect to XML registries, the idea of one place for everything is sci-fi stuff, but there are smaller Communities of Interest (COIs) for exchange. Over time, they will roll up to be more centralized, but it  needs to be  more centralized. The thinking is right, but as Bob said, it needs governance. The main point is, you mentioned earlier how it’ll accept the data. Are you planning on moving to a Web Services interface, or a SOAP [Simple Object Access Protocol,  http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/ ] interface…          Ms. Adams:    We’d love to. We tried last year to get Web Services implemented. It’s not a technical problem; it’s already constructed. The problem is hosting it. Theoretically, the technology is in front of the policy right now in most agencies. If you ask them to put it on an outward-facing server, whether it’s Apache (it doesn’t have to be Microsoft—there are Sun servers) in most situations, you can construct Web Services inside the firewall, but as soon as you want to go outside and pass information inside, it’s not supported. It’s a huge policy issue.         Mr. Williams:    It boggles my mind that you can send it as an email attachment, but not as Web Services.         Ms. Adams:    We’d love to stand up Web Services, but folks are not ready to get there. In fact, we have to pull the data. There are a lot of reasons independent of the platform. We were working to create an Apache platform, but we couldn’t do it.         Mr. Williams:    Is it the security aspects?         Ms. Adams:    It’s more a policy thing. There are ways to do it. It’s just a matter of educating folks out there.         Unknown participant:    Another issue is the metadata in there. You should have a security application associated with each one, so you can’t look at it as a single solution. It’s a pluralistic society. We have to come together. The way you describe the OMB 300, it always gets trumped by what you need today. I believe, as Kevin submitted, the COIs are the first step.         Ms. Adams:    If we had a year to work on it, that would be great, but the problem is guidance. It’s not complete, there’s a short time frame, and we’re restricted on what we can do, but I agree.         Unknown participant:    Two years ago we went to OMB…         Ms. Adams:    All kinds of things are missing: documentation on the schema; it goes on and on. We can’t create the document by ourselves. The business centers have to give us the document, which means they have to know why the schema’s implemented. I think you’ll see them hire an XML person who can bridge the gap to make the job easier. If you’re technical, you tell me the data and I can make it work.         Unknown participant:    I see an imbalance between the maturity of the parts (non-technical and technical parts). You can swap out the technical part. We should drive to that; a business side and a technical side.          Ms. Adams:    When you try to do things like that, there are all kinds of policy issues that drive it. Our technology is way ahead of the steps they can take.         Mr. Ambur:    That relates to one of my questions—whether the technology is enabling the folks at OMB to see the potential to conduct their business in new and better ways.         Ms. Adams:    I think it is. They’re like any other business. They have to see it, and improve when time allows. It’s a “it worked last year, we’ll be fine, keep going” kind of thing. You have to set your priorities…unless this is going to break, this other stuff comes down to the end.         If anyone has comments on the schema, we’d love them, so we can give them to OMB. Owen made great comments on their information collection—stuff we should make visible to other folks. We do have a system up now: “FEAMS” [FEA Management System,  http://feapmo.gov/feams.asp ]. We want to make this information available to people on an as-needed basis. We have it now, all in XML.         Mr. Ambur:    Following up on Bob’s presentation, it’s one thing to tell agencies that all IT investments should align with the FEA, but just saying it doesn’t make it happen – no matter how hard agencies may try to comply.    Having access to the information provided by other agencies in their Exhibit 300 submissions would help facilitate the necessary coordination.         Ms. Adams:    And they’re evolving their process. Last year, they didn’t have it in XML. This year they did.         Mr. Ambur:    I’m a great advocate of the bottom-up approach, together with good documentation that is widely and readily shared.    I hope we can enable folks all across government to readily share their XML schemas so they don’t all have to reinvent the process of sharing their data elements.    That’s the sense in which I’m looking at the registry as a tool to facilitate collaboration among communities of practice.    It’s one thing for agencies to put their schemas on their own website and that is certainly better than nothing, but I hope we do better than that.    Incidentally, in the registry meeting this afternoon, Ken Gill is going to brief us on the Justice Department’s global justice information sharing XML registry requirements.    Anything else, Roy [Morgan]?         Mr. Roy Morgan:    We’ll at least talk about the products we have to play with. Please come this afternoon, if you’d like to participate.         Mr. Ambur:    There’s a link in today’s agenda [http://xml.gov/agenda/20030820.htm] for the revised XSD for Exhibit 300.          Ms. Adams:    There will be another one.         Mr. Ambur:    Should I change the link?         Ms. Adams :    It should be the same.         Mr. Sall:    There should be a different version in it, so it should change.         Ms. Adams:    Look for more information in it.         Mr. Niemann:    Can you answer my question as to what forms are available (because they were originally done on a spreadsheet)?          Ms. Adams:    The OMB 53 was. The 300 is hard to do on a spreadsheet. Last year, people tried to copy into Excel. It has limits.         Mr. Niemann:    So it’s only in a schema, not in a spreadsheet?         Ms. Adams:    Correct. The order maps directly to the A-11, because we couldn’t figure out any other way. One way was to take the work document and just go right down in the same order for people unfamiliar with XML.         Mr. Niemann:    Was there any attention to the metadata?         Ms. Adams:    No.         Unknown participant:    If you create a vocabulary or a UID, it eliminates the problem of text itself. The fact that it’s business-friendly means it can be technology-friendly if a UID is attached.         Ms. Adams:    I completely agree. We have limited funds and resources to help OMB do it. Most folks don’t know what the XML document is, or how to create it. They have questions like, “Do we need to hire a developer?” and “ What’s the tool use?” Big agencies, yes, they might hire a developer. Small agencies, no.         Mr. Sall:    Where can we get the free tool?         Ms. Brubaker:    It’ll be posted to a URL [Universal Resource Locator]. We should have it by the end of today.         Mr. Ambur:    I’d like to establish a link on the [XML.gov] website.         Mr. Sall:    There’s nothing about the schema or process to prevent someone from using a different tool to input the information they need?         Ms. Adams:    Yes.          Mr. Sall:    Providing a forms interface from the GUI [Graphical User Interface]?         Ms. Adams:    Basically like going from Word over. The question was, do we have a tool that allows you to enter it in, and go back and forth from Word? Yes, because Office 11 supports mapping to XSD schema. We did not create that. OMB looked at it briefly. All the testing is just agencies looking at it. We anticipated needing a tool. This was the easiest way. They didn’t pay us to do this.         Mr. Sall:    The best way to get people outside Microsoft in is by creating a solution to this?         Ms. Adams:    Schema, or solution.      Mr. Sall:    The guidelines…         Ms. Adams:    Convincing OMB that the guidelines are what they want to implement. Our hands are tied.         Mr. Ambur:    If you’re talking about the guidance in the [Federal XML] Developer’s Guide, this group could recommend that they be elevated through the Emerging Technologies Subcommittee [of the AIC] to the Governance Subcommittee, which could in turn elevate it to OMB.    EPA and the Department of the Navy are ahead of the government as a whole for their own internal requirements, but their best thinking needs to be rolled up for the benefit of the government as a whole. This is a voluntary group, but we could make that recommendation to the ET subcommittee.         Mr. Sall:    My concern is that the FEA is coming out with all these documents. The DRM talks about ISO 11179, and other conventions…ebXML, UBL [Universal Business Language,  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ubl ], ways of defining elements. I completely understand that you’re focused on getting it out and retrofitting later, and the BizTalk Server XSLT, and mapping this year’s to next year’s, but my fear is that if something is on the FEAPMO site and people from agencies (who aren’t familiar with how it’s developed)…I’d say it’s the old “eating your own dog food,” and with international…         Unknown participant:    That’s OMB’s discussion.         Ms. Adams:    It would be a task on the list of stuff OMB wants us to do. It would cost them money. They need to be convinced that there’s some value.         Mr. Ambur:    Let me reiterate what I said earlier. This is a voluntary group. We have no authority to tell anyone to do anything, but we can make recommendations. GSA [General Services Administration] is also working on it. If there’s a strong will in this group to elevate it to the governance subcommittee, I could do that.         Ms. Adams:    We can make it simple first, then complex. I think people are going to go the simple path at first. To have an XSD document, that’s pretty complex for those ones who aren’t familiar with it. This process is huge, so the next one (simple to complex) isn’t as hard.         Mr. Niemann:    This is a tip of the iceberg. Booz Allen suggested asking us how to address the problem. Some agencies are already using advanced tools. OMB has a back-end system trying to move to XML, for receiving part of the information agencies have. Both groups wanted to go their own way. We suggested that they need to work out the protocols between them. The EAs [Enterprise Architects] will tell you this has to be a living process, and work throughout the year as part of the planning process, not just September 8. We really need interactive Web Services—a living system where people are working both ends—and do pilots.         The other point is the need for more than a schema. We need to move up in the ontology world, like RDF [Rich Data Format], because this is like a collaborative business case, where you discuss it with others who are doing it, and bring about the consolidation that OMB wants, so it takes on another dimension like ontology markup, so people can discuss it with one another.          Ms. Adams:    That’s what FEAMS is there for. I agree it should be an evolutionary process, and not wait until the end of the year. That’s tough for them. As you know, they’re not really done. They have a second submission at the beginning of this next year. About the June time frame, they’ll bring us in again. For them, it’s great feedback. I encourage you to give it.         Unknown participant:    That ontology is the way the business communicates to taxonomies and business patterns. That’s the part we’re missing. Those two work in synch. The business people have to map the abstractions. That’s the real power. The business communication.  Not  understanding the ontology.         Ms. Adams:    They don’t understand the business value.         Unknown participant:    And that’s the way they approach the project—short-sighted, immediate goals. The business process is the way it’s evolved over the last 20 years. The XML group should say, “Let’s start building these things to level the playing field.”         Mr. Ambur:    I’m not sure people will ever understand ontologies, for example, but they can understand results. Bob’s presentation about the DRM plays into it. Ken’s comment about eating our own dog food is also noteworthy; OMB should be eating its own dog food with respect to the DRM.    Susie’s comments that simple wins over complex is also very well taken, and we should move forward every day, in any small ways that we can, rather than expecting the “big bang” to solve all our problems.         Ms. Adams:    It takes time, re-architecting the ways agencies do business. “Data” sometimes is a four-letter word, because data have power. I don’t necessarily want to give you my data. People look at Web Services, and say, “No way, I don’t want you to see my data,” so people have to be comfortable sharing their data. Now people email and say, “You can look at it.” With that, Bob can go look at it.         Mr. Ambur:    It reminds me of another question. I understand OMB intends at some point to make the data from agency Exhibit 300 submissions public. Is that your understanding?         Ms. Adams:    I think once the FEAMS is done, that’s the intent.         Mr. Niemann :    One or two ITIPS records managers will be given access.         Mr. Ambur:    So your understanding is that it’s not public yet?         Mr. Niemann :    No, they’re still piloting. I think the feeling is, if they give one person at each agency access, they can figure out how to share. They want to control it so we don’t see 300s show up in the press and other places.         Mr. Ambur:    I suspect if the XML instance documents were made available, a number of vendors could show some great stuff.         Mr. Niemann :    At our September conference, we have about 10 vendors who are going to show what they’ve done. There is already an impressive number of ontology applications in the industry itself. We can show that it’s more than just talk.          Mr. Ambur:    Are there any other questions or comments for Susie and Carolyn? We’re a little ahead of schedule. There’s nothing wrong with adjourning early—I’m sure you can all use the time.         The ET subcommittee is charged with developing a process where the IT lifecycle can be managed. That’s a fancy way of saying that the CIOs can’t effectively respond to all the vendors who are trying to communicate with them. We need a better way to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of such communications.    In my view, the end of the ET process is submission and approval of a fully completed Exhibit 300. I’m interested in Susie’s comments about the order of the elements of the XSD following the order of the elements of the guidance itself.    In the early stages of the ET process, it may not use exactly the same elements of the 300 Exhibit, but I believe the data gathered in the ET process should map into Exhibit 300, and whenever possible, the data itself should be reused in the A-11 process.          I’m thinking of using our next meeting, on September 10, to discuss the elements of the XML schema for the first stage of the ET process, with the aim of delivering a strawman schema to the ET subcommittee at its next meeting.         If there are no other questions or comments, I thank you all.              End meeting.         Attendees:                          Last Name                First Name                Organization                        Adams             Susie             Microsoft                   Altner             Bruce             NASA/SAIC                   Ambur             Owen             FWS                   Bennett             Daniel                                 Billups             Prince             DISA                   Brish             Arie             Conformative Systems                   Cox             Bruce             USPTO                   Derrick             John             Conformative Systems                   Feagans             James             DOJ                   Fong             Elizabeth             NIST                   Gorman             Will             PureEdge                   Hassam             Amin             I411                   Haycock             Bob             FEAPMO                   Kantor             Bohdan             Library of Congress                   Lubash             Mike             DFAS                   McKennirey             Matthew             Conclusive                   Morgan             Roy             NIST                   O’Connell             Greg             PureEdge                   Rogers             Rick             Fenestra                   Safran             Sol             IRS EPMO                   Sall             Ken             SiloSmashers                   Sylvestri             JD             Corel                   Turnbull             Susan             GSA                   Todd              Vincent             GSU XMLlegal                   Williams             Kevin             BlueOxide                   Yee             Theresa             LMI                   Yenchi             Greg             VA
