The order permanently enjoins Bell and his entities from further       violations of certain provisions of federal commodity law and CFTC       regulations, bars them from any activity in the futures industry for       themselves or on behalf of others, and requires restitution payments to       customers totaling approximately $3.4 million, plus pre- and       post-judgement interest. The court's order stems from a six-count       civil injunctive action filed by the CFTC in November 1993 (see CFTC News       Release #3719-93, November 22, 1993).                   The court's order finds that, between 1990 and November 1993, Bell       and BBIC defrauded approximately 110 investors of approximately $8       million in a commodity pool formed to trade oil futures. The court's       order further finds that Bell and BBIC defrauded these investors by,       among other things, sending statements to investors that falsely       represented that their funds had been used to trade oil futures and had       generated profits, when they had not.                   The order also finds that Bell and BBIC used investors' funds to make       returns of principal and purported profits to earlier investors, in a       manner akin to a ""Ponzi"" scheme. Further, the order finds that       all of the defendants converted investors' funds to their personal       use, purchasing such items as a home, a twin-jet airplane, gold coins,       and interests in oil wells and gas leases. Finally, the order finds that       Bell and his company, BBIC, acted as commodity pool operators without       being registered as such with the CFTC.                   In October 1994, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma       charged Bell with wire fraud in a single count information concerning       these same activities. Bell pled guilty and has recently completed a       44-month prison sentence.                   The receiver in the CFTC's civil action, Gary C. Clark, Esq., a Tulsa       attorney, has already gathered and returned approximately $4.5 million to       defrauded investors pursuant to previous court orders.                   # # #             Updated February 1, 2001"
GX270-32-0832221	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 Re: U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corporation by James P.W. Goss, Esq. P.O. Box 578 Rutland, VT 05702 Genier Slate Quarry c/o Victor C. Genier Fair Haven, VT 05743 MEMORANDUM OF DECISION This decision pertains to a motion to dismiss filed by Victor C. Genier on the basis that his operation involves only 9.9 acres of land. As is explained below, the Environmental Board denies the motion because the question of how much land is involved should be the subject of proof at hearing. BACKGROUND This matter pertains to whether a permit is required pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 151 (Act 250) for two different slate quarry operations located near each other off Blissville Road in Poultney. One of the operations involves U.S. Quarried Slate Products (U.S. Slate) and Scotch Hill Leasing Corporation. U.S. Slate is the quarry operator and Scotch Hill is the landowner. U.S. Slate's quarry operation is located on the site of the former Eagle Quarry. On July 31, 1992, District #l Coordinator Anthony Stout issued Advisory Opinion iitl-165, concluding that no Act 250 permit was required for U.S. Slate's proposed reopening of the Eagle Quarry. In that opinion, the District Coordinator stated that no Act 250 permit would be needed for the reopening because he believed it did not present ""a potential for significant impacts."" He also stated that an Act 250 permit will be required for a ~ manufacturing facility proposed for the site by U.S. Slate. The District Coordinator's opinion was appealed by Alfred Locke and Roger and Doreen Bushey, who own property near U.S. Slate's quarry site. On November 5, 1992, Associate General Counsel Aaron .4dler issued Advisory Opinion #EO-92-267, concluding that an Act 250 permit was and is required prior to reopening the Eagle Quarry. On November 13. 1992. U.S. Slate filed a petition for a declaratory ruling. Following agreement by the Associate General Counsel to reconsider and a withdrawal request from U.S. Slate, Board Chair Elizabeth Courtney remanded the matter for reconsideration. On January 8. 1993, the Associate General Counsel issued Advisory Opinion #EO-92-267 (Reconsidered), Declaratory Ruling Requests #279 and #283   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. $283 Memorandum of Decision Page 2 stating that it remains his opinion that an Act 250 permit was and is required. On January 14, 1993, U.S. Slate and Scotch Hill refiled their petition for a declaratory ruling. The other quarry operation involves extraction by Victor Genier near the site of the former Sbardella Quarry on land located off Blissville Road which he 1:ec-e- ,._-I __^_^_^_ to bw &tom X':Xam P. r-err TL: and Ratter&e Le-fi Qn ^_^_ titi YLupv>e> December 7, 1992, the Dikrict #1 Coordinator issued Advisory Opinion #l-174, concluding that no permit is needed for Mr. Genier's planned extraction activity because the quarry was operating until the early 1970s and resumption of quarry activity on-site will not create new significant impacts. On December 14, 1992, the Busheys filed an appeal of this opinion. Pursuant to 10 V.S.A. $ 6007(c), their appeal is being treated as a petition for a declaratory ruling. On January 21, 1993, the Board issued a notice of a prehearing conference stating that the petitions for declaratory ruling concerning these two quarries will be consolidated due to the proximity of the quarry sites, similarity in issues, and overlap in the parties. On February 2, the Chair convened a prehearing conference. On February 9, 1993, Mr. Genier filed a motion to dismiss. On February 19, the Chair issued a prehearing conference report and order. On February "" 22, the Board received both an opposition to the motion from the Busheys and : response by Mr. Genier to that opposition. The Board deliberated on February 24. Mr. Genier and the Busheys were orally informed of the Boards decision on ' February 26. ~  ti  DISCUSSION Mr. Genier has filed a motion to dismiss that is now before us. Under Board Rule 18(D), the granting of a motion to dismiss is discretionary. Genier's motion is his allegation that only 9.9 acres are a so-called ""lo-acre town."" Mr. Genier specifically states 9.9-acre portion of the approximately 91-acre L_enz parcel and that this is the portion he plans to buy.  :I /:  :,  The basis for Mr. involved and Poultney is that he is only leasing a i: for the quarry operation  In relevant part, 10 V.S.A. 5 6081(a) states that an Act 250 permit is required prior to commencement of construction on: or commencement of. ""development."" To paraphrase 10 V.S.4.  6001(j) and Board Rule 2(A)(2),  `A'   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 3 development subject to Act 250 includes, in relevant part, the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes on a tract or tracts owned or controlled by a person consisting of more than an acre of land, except that in towns with permanent subdivision and zoning bylaws, the land involved must be 10 or more acres. In determining the amount of land involved, the Board counts the tract on which the improvements are located, as well as other land within a radms of five mde:. of my involved lane! 2w'I;l_:! __ ""incident to the i'ie"" or iiihich --.LJ-L 1; _ bears a demonstrable relationship to the main tract and the relationship is such that there is a substantial likelihood of impact on the values Act 250 protects. See Board Rule 2(F). Mr. Genier's argument is that there cannot possibly be Act 250~jurisdiction because of the amounr of leased iand that he intends to buy. It appears uncontested that the land subject to the lease/purchase agreement consists of 9.9 acres. Even so, we see three possible and separate ways in which there may be Act 250 jurisdiction, and thus we deny the motion because these matters should be the subject of proof at hearing. First, in Re: Salvas Paving. Inc., Declaratory Ruling #229 (June 20, 1991), the Board ruled that leasing less than 10 acres of a greater than lo-acre tract does not defeat jurisdiction if the development is in fact on a tract of greater than 10 acres owned by a person, even if the owner is not the lessor-developer. Mr. Genier's motion states that he has a lease/purchase agreement with the Lenzes but does not supply the agreement. For the reasons stated in w, the lease ' part of the agreement is immaterial if the actual tract on which the development is taking place consists of more than 10 acres. The purchase part may be material _ but questions arise concerning the terms. What is the period of the lease? When will the purchase actually occur ? Can the purchase be defeated by the occurrence of subsequent events (such as default on lease terms)? Mr. Genier's purchase of the 9.9 acres could occur so far in the future or be so hinged on contingencies : i that it may be too speculative to be a basis for decision. To assist us in resolving ~this issue, we will require, pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 5 6027(a) and Rule 17(E), that a ~ copy of the lease/purchase agreement be prefiled and be entered into the record at hearing. ;: Second, the motion addresses primarily the main tract on which slate extraction is to occur. It does not foreclose the possibility that there is additional involved land within a radius of five miles. In this regard, we note that Mr. Genier's response to the Busheys' opposition states that there is no such   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 4 additional involved land. However, it is clear from the Busheys' opposition that they believe that such land exists. Accordingly, there is a dispute concerning the facts which a hearing will be necessary to resolve. Third, it is possible that, even if jurisdiction might attach because he and 10 V.S.4. 5 600!(A)(?4)!iii). If thev were would still be more. thanld acres under Mr. Genier purchases the 9.9-acre parcel, the Lenzes may be one ""person"" under held to be one person. then there the ownership and control of that person.  10 V.S.A. 5 6001(14)(A)(iii) provides, among other things, that ""person"": [IIncludes individuals and entities affiliated with each other for profit, consideration, or any other beneficial interest derived from the partition or division of land . . Mr. Genier and the Lenzes may fit this definition. They appear to have an agreement (an affiliation) for the Lenzes to divide their tract and sell a portion to Mr. Genier. Thus, both parties appear to be getting profit, consideration, and beneficial interest from the division of the Lenz tract. Thus, the facts we know now indicate that these individuals may constitute one person. It may be that evidence introduced at hearing will demonstrate that the above-referenced definition of a person does not apply to the facts of this case. Further, we note that we have never applied this definition outside of the context of an allegation that lots are part of a subdivision subject to Act 250 because of the creation of ten lots within a district within five years. See 10 V.S.A. @ 6001( 19), 6081(a) (Act 250 applies to subdivisions as well as developments). In this case, the question is whether Mr. Genier's quarry operation constitutes a. development and we may well decide, after hearing from the parties, that the definition is not applicable in the context of an alleged development. However, we believe that these determinations should be made after we have had an opportunity to hear the facts.   U.S. Quarried Slate Products, Inc. and Scotch Hill Leasing Corp., D.R. #279 Genier Slate Quarry, D.R. #283 Memorandum of Decision Page 5 ORDER 1.

Belden, who was Enron's Chief Energy Trader, has agreed to  plead guilty  to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a scheme with others at Enron Corp. to manipulate California's energy market, a scheme that was designed in part to alter the price of electricity in the state.   In the first  criminal charges   to be filed in an investigation of the manipulation of the California energy markets during the power crisis of 2000 to 2001, Enron's chief energy trader was charged in San Francisco federal court with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  The defendant has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the United States in its investigation.  A hearing for the defendant to plead guilty is scheduled for noon Pacific time in San Francisco federal court before Judge Martin J. Jenkins.   The charges are based on Enron's intentional manipulation of the California energy markets, which was done in part to affect the price of electricity in California.  In pleading guilty, the defendant will admit that Enron's manipulation of the California energy markets was illegal.  The defendant, Timothy N. Belden, also agreed to cooperate with the United States in its continuing investigation into the manipulation of the California energy markets.    The charges were announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C. today by Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Kevin V. Ryan, United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, Leslie Caldwell, Director of the Enron Task Force, and Bruce Gebhardt, the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   The investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, the Enron Task Force, the Antitrust and Fraud Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the San Francisco division of the FBI.   Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, the head of the Justice Department's  Corporate Fraud Task Force, said, ""During the period of the charged conspiracy, Enron's revenues from Belden's trading unit rose from $50 million in 1999 to $500 million in 2000 to $800 million in 2001.  While Enron benefitted from the overall rise in electricity prices, the information charges that a portion of these increased revenues was due to the execution of these schemes.  The conspiracy charged in this information allowed Enron to exploit and intensify the California energy crisis and prey on energy consumers at their most vulnerable moment.""   U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan, a member of the Corporate Fraud Task Force, said in announcing the guilty plea, ""These charges answer the question that has long troubled California consumers:  whether the energy crisis was spurred in part by criminal activity.  The answer is a resounding yes.  The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice those who served their own selfish purposes by intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers in California and on the West Coast.""   Mr. Belden, age 35 of Houston, Texas, was charged in a Criminal Information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  The Criminal Information was filed on October 9, 2002 but was under seal until this morning, when the defendant made his initial appearance in federal court.     Mr. Belden was arraigned on the charges this morning in San Francisco federal court. A change of plea hearing is set for noon today.    According to the charges, Mr. Belden was employed by Enron Corp. in its West Power Trading Division (""West Power"") in Portland, Oregon.  West Power bought and sold wholesale electricity in the Western United States, including California.  From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Belden is alleged to have conspired with others to manipulate the California energy markets and to defraud California electricity customers and other participants in the wholesale electricity markets.    The Information alleges that in 1999, Enron's West Power generated approximately $50 million in revenues.  By 2001, West Power's revenues increased to approximately $800 million as the price of electricity skyrocketed.  Prices during the height of the energy crisis rose from $25 per megawatt hour to, in some cases, $1,500 per megawatt hour.  It is alleged that the price increase is attributable in part to the schemes charged in the Information.   In pleading guilty, Mr. Belden will admit that beginning in approximately 1998, and continuing through 2001, he and other individuals at Enron conspired to manipulate the energy markets in California by:       !      misrepresenting the nature and amount of electricity Enron proposed to supply in the California market, as well as the load it intended to serve;   !      creating false congestion and falsely relieving that congestion on California transmission lines, and otherwise manipulating fees it would receive for relieving congestion;   !      misrepresenting that energy was from out-of-state to avoid federally approved price caps, when in fact, the energy it was selling was from the State of California and had been exported and re-imported;   !      falsely represented that Enron intended to supply energy and ancillary services it did not in fact have and did not intend to supply.       As a result of these false schedules, Mr. Belden will admit that he and his co-conspirators were able to manipulate prices in certain markets, arbitrage price differences between the markets, obtain ""congestion management"" payments in excess of what they would have received with accurate schedules, and receive prices for electricity above price caps set by the California Independent System Operator (""ISO"") and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Mr. Belden admitted that he and others received part of the revenues from the schemes through the ISO, which on a monthly basis billed all customers for wholesale electricity in California, and paid all suppliers, like Enron.  The ISO made these payments during the course of the conspiracy to Enron by interstate wire transmission through the Bank of America in San Francisco.    No sentencing date has yet been set before Judge Jenkins.  The maximum statutory penalty for violating 18 U.S.C. § 371 is five years and a fine amount of $250,000, plus restitution.  However, the actual sentence is dictated by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of factors, and will be imposed in the discretion of the Court.   According to the plea agreement, the defendant could be eligible for a lower sentence based on the extent of his cooperation with the United States in its investigation.  In addition, the plea agreement requires the defendant to forfeit $2.1 million to the United States, which represents the portion of his salary and bonuses tied to the fraud.     The prosecution is the result of an ongoing investigation begun four months ago by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.  The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.   The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick D. Robbins and Matthew J. Jacobs, as well as Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey, a trial attorney with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice based in San Francisco, along with the assistance of Paralegal Deborah Young.     A copy of this press release may be found on the U.S. Attorney's Office's website at  www.usdoj.gov/usao/can .   Related court documents and information may be found on the District Court website  at  www.cand.uscourts.gov   or on  http://pacer.cand.uscourts/gov.

Washington, D.C. 20426           Dear Chairman Wood:           We are writing to request  that you provide the Committee on Energy and Commerce with specific information  regarding the status of Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC)  investigation into electricity markets in California and the West.     The FERC began its investigation of Western bulk power markets in July  2000.    Since then, in a series of  subsequent investigations, findings and orders, the FERC has taken numerous  steps and made numerous recommendations attempting to address electricity supply  shortages and price volatility in California and the region.              Throughout this time, as you  may recall, this Committee has carefully followed the FERCs activities, along  with Californias attempts to correct its flawed electricity restructuring  policies, and the West-wide energy crisis in general.     Beginning with a  field  hearing in San Diego in September 11, 2000 , the Subcommittee on Energy and  Air Quality (at that time Energy and Power) conducted numerous hearings to  investigate the electric supply and pricing problems occurring in California,  culminating in a legislative process and a written admonition by this Committee  for the FERC to take all necessary steps to ensure that wholesale power prices  are just and reasonable.               In the 107 th   Congress, the Committee developed an extensive hearing record on the California  energy crisis.    On February 15,  2001, the Subcommittee held a hearing entitled  Electricity  Markets: Lessons Learned From California , in which we heard testimony  from California utility regulators, utilities, market participants, and market  analysts.    On March 20 and 22, 2001,  the Subcommittee held two days of hearings entitled  Electricity  Markets: California.     In  addition to further examining the causes of the electricity supply problems  experienced by California, witnesses were asked to comment on what California  has done and could do to address the problem, and similarly what FERC has done  and could do to address the situation.    These  recommendations resulted in a legislative proposal, The  Electric  Emergency Act of 2001 , two days of legislative hearings in May 2001, and a  successful Subcommittee markup.    While  the bill was never enacted into law, many of the proposals were subsequently  adopted by both Federal agencies and the State of California.           The FERC testified at three of  the Subcommittees hearings on the energy crisis in California and the West.     Throughout these hearings, the Subcommittee heard numerous allegations  and denials of wholesale electricity price manipulation, and numerous  allegations and denials of failure of the State and Federal regulatory  structures governing electricity markets and expansion of electric power  infrastructure.    In a  letter  dated June 12, 2001 , Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton, along with 13  other House members, expressed strong concern about the threat of price spikes  and blackouts that summer, and strongly advised the FERC to take further actions  to mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California.     Specifically, the letter called on FERC to create a West-wide price  mitigation plan to ensure that all rates for wholesale electricity sales are  just and reasonable and, if rates were not just and reasonable, to require  refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law.     Soon thereafter, the FERC expanded its  innovative  plan for market monitoring and mitigation in California, and opened a formal  investigation into real-time wholesale power sales throughout the West.               On February 13, 2002, the FERC  initiated yet another fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of  electric and natural gas prices.    As part of that investigation, the FERC recently released  several documents in its possession describing the questionable trading  practices of Enron Corporation.           We are deeply troubled about  market manipulation as described in the memos.     We ask the FERC to carefully review the impacts upon consumers of  practices that created artificial congestion, increased benchmark prices, or  exaggerated revenues and trading quantities through mutual round-trip  transactions.           In  light of these recent disclosures, we request that the FERC provide answers to  the following questions no later than Friday, June 7, 2002.                       Since      the FERC issued its December 15, 2000 Order, what specific steps has the      FERC taken to investigate wholesale power sales in California and the West?                            Summarize      the FERCs findings to date resulting from these investigations, including      the principal causes of electric power price volatility over the past two      years in California and Western Markets and any other contributing factors.                                What      is the FERCs view of the legality of the practices described in the Enron      memos?                               Did      the trading practices described in the Enron memos violate specific rules of      the California Independent System Operator?                            When      did the FERC become aware of the Enron memoranda?                            Was      the FERC previously aware of such trading practices by (a) Enron      Corporation; or (b) other power sellers (including entities not directly      subject to the FERCs jurisdiction)?                            What      specific steps it the FERC taking to investigate similar trading practices      by other power sellers (including non-jurisdictional entities)?                            Summarize      the preliminary findings of the FERC regarding the February 23, 2002      fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural      gas prices.                            Does      the existence of such trading practices as described in the Enron memos      change the earlier conclusions of the FERC regarding the principle causes      and contributing factors of high wholesale power prices in California and      the West?                            Has      the FERC undertaken any analysis of the impact of such trading practices on      consumer electricity prices?    If      so, please provide the Committee with your findings, along with the data and      information used in the analysis.                            (Describe      the FERCs legal authority to investigate and, if appropriate, regulate      such trading practices.    Include      a description of the FERCs authority with respect to entities not      directly subject to the FERCs jurisdiction.                            Assess      whether the FERCs current legal authority is adequate to address any      harms to the public interest related to such trading practices (including      with respect to non-jurisdictional entities).                            Recently,      a California State Senate committee investigating the electricity crisis      released the transcript of a conversation on July 3, 2001, between an      employee of the California Independent System Operator (CA ISO) and a trader      for Enron Corporation.    In that      conversation, the CA ISO employee requests that the Enron trader place a bid      to buy excess standby power at a specific price, reveals bidding information      only available to the CA ISO, and attempts to artificially raise the price      for excess standby power in the hour-ahead market.         Please describe the specific steps the FERC has taken to investigate      this incident.    Does the FERC      have information regarding other incidents in which the CA ISO has attempted      to manipulate power prices?    Please      describe the status of any FERC investigations of the CA ISO and summarize      any findings to date resulting from such investigations.                         Please  provide written responses and all pertinent documents no later than the close of  business June 14, 2002.    If you have any questions, please contact Jason Bentley,  Committee Counsel, at (202) 226-2424.    Thank  you for your prompt attention

GX022-39-3983687	"FOR RELEASE:  JULY 14,     1998       Promoter of Online Pyramid     Scheme Agrees to Settle FTC Charges       In its continuing attack on fraudulent unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE), the Federal     Trade Commission today announced that it was publishing for public comment a proposed     consent agreement with Kalvin P. Schmidt, an alleged promoter and operator of a high-tech     chain letter software program. According to the FTC’s complaint, Schmidt, doing     business as DKS Enterprises, DS Productions, DES Enterprises,   www.mkt-american.com       and  www.mkt-usa.com , operated a web site promoting two chain or pyramid     marketing programs, ""Mega$Nets"" and ""MegaResources.""       In its complaint, the agency alleges that the Waseca, Minnesota, resident offered     consumers who visited the web sites copies of software programs that formed the basis of     the pyramid marketing programs. For example, contained within the Mega$Nets software     program is a list of five names and addresses. The software program and the web sites     direct a consumer to send $20 to each of the five people listed in the software in order     for the consumer to get his or her name placed at the top of the list of names. The FTC     alleged that upon receiving the money, the five people on the list will send ""access     codes"" to the consumer and these codes will allow the consumer to ""unlock""     the software, delete the last name on the list, and insert his or her name on the top of     the list. In addition, Schmidt’s promotional materials instructed consumers to     perpetuate the scheme by providing the software to others for free by copying the disks     and mailing them or by sending unsolicited e-mail to others, the agency said. The     FTC’s complaint alleges that the ""MegaResource"" operated similarly.       Schmidt also provided others with the means to perpetuate the chain marketing programs     by creating and designing websites that contained copies of the software programs, hosting     these web sites on a server he leases, and composing and sending e-mail messages to     consumers directing them to websites promoting these programs, according to the FTC. In     addition, the complaint alleges that Schmidt made false and unsubstantiated earnings     claims.       The proposed settlement of these charges would ban Schmidt from participating in any     chain letter schemes, pyramid sales schemes or Ponzi schemes, and from assisting or     providing others with the means or instrumentalities to participate in these prohibited     marketing schemes. In addition, the proposed agreement would require him to have a basis     for any earnings claims he makes in the future. At the time such a representation is made,     Schmidt also would have to have competent and reliable evidence that substantiates any     representation about the income, profits, or sales of any marketing plan or program or any     material fact. Finally, the settlement contains various recordkeeping requirements.       The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement for public comment was     4-0. An announcement regarding the proposed consent agreement will be published in the     Federal Register shortly. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 60 days,     after which the Commission will decide whether to make it final. Comments should be     addressed to the FTC, Office of the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,     Washington, D.C. 20580.       NOTE:  A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not     constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent order on     a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation     of such an order may result in a civil penalty of $11,000.

GX271-87-8739859	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling Petition #389  Memorandum of Decision  This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (""Petition"") from a Jurisdictional Opinion (""JO"") concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On June 29, 2000, the Environmental Board (""Board"") issued a Memorandum of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. On July 13, 2001, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products (collectively, ""Catamount Slate"") filed a Motion to Reconsider the June 29 Memorandum of Decision, seeking a new decision on one of the Preliminary Issues, to wit, whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission (""Commission"") had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) and EBR 3(C). On July 27, 2001, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on the Motion to Reconsider. These Memoranda of Decision contain the relevant Procedural History up to July 27. On August 28, 2001, Joanne Calvi, on behalf of herself and other parties to this appeal (David and Joanne Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse (collectively, the ""Neighbors"")), filed a request to extend the filing date of one of the Neighbors' exhibits, N20, to September 7, 2001. On August 29, 2001, Catamount Slate filed a further ""Motion for Reconsideration on Preliminary Issues And/Or Ruling on New Issues."" On September 12, 2001, within their Supplemental Pre-filed Testimony, the Neighbors requested the Board to issue three subpoenas. See Exhibits N31, N33 and N34.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 2  The Board deliberated on all pending motions and requests on September 19, 2001. II. Discussion A. Catamount Slate's Motion for Reconsideration  In her May 23, 2001 Prehearing Order Board Chair Marcy Harding identified three Preliminary Issues: 1. Whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(a) and EBR 3(C). 2. Whether Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, Lindsey Waterhouse and/or Priscilla Waterhouse are entitled to party status in this Declaratory Ruling. 3. Whether the definition of the ""Project"" in this Declaratory Ruling should include the construction of a commercial slate building on the said  122 -acre tract where the quarry is located. On June 29, 2001, following written argument from the parties, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on the Preliminary Issues. On July 13, 2001, Catamount Slate sought reconsideration of the first and second Preliminary Issues. On July 27, 2001, the Board issued a Memorandum of Decision on Catamount Slate's reconsideration request. Catamount Slate's August 29, 2001 Motion for Reconsideration asks the Board to again address the first Preliminary Issue. Environmental Board Rule (""EBR"") 31(A) states: (A) Motions to alter decisions. A party may file within 30 days form the date of the decision of the board or district commission one and only one motion to alter with respect to the decision. However, no party may file a motion to alter a decision concerning or resulting from a motion to alter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 3  Pursuant to EBR 31(A), Catamount Slate present motion is barred, both because it is untimely, as it was filed beyond the 30-day time limit imposed by the rule, and because it constitutes a second request to reconsider an issue which has been decided. For these reasons, it is denied. 1. Legislative history  Even if Catamount Slate's motion were to be permitted under EBR 31(A), the Board finds it to be without merit. Catamount Slate makes a number of arguments in support of its belief that the initial Jurisdictional Opinion which addressed its quarry registration, JO #1-S-50, became final as to the world once 30 days had passed from its issuance date. Catamount Slate argues first that the legislative history of the slate quarry registration provision, 10 V.S.A. 6081(l), requires that all Jurisdictional Opinions that address quarry registrations become final as to the world 30 days after they are issued, whether or not anyone has been notified of their issuance. As noted in the Board's earlier Memoranda of Decision, 10 V.S.A. 6081(l) states: (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. The language of 6081(l)(3) is neither confusing nor ambiguous. If a party wants a final determination as to whether a slate quarry exemption applies, he is to follow the process established by 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Because this language is clear and straightforward, resort to legislative history is neither necessary nor appropriate. ""When the meaning of a statute is plain on its face, we have no need for construction, but rather must enforce it according to its terms."" Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 403 (1997); In re Margaret Susan P., 169 Vt. 252, 263 (1999) (only where statutory language is ""unclear and ambiguous"" may legislative history be used to determine legislative intent); Hitchcock Clinic, Inc. v. Mackie, 160 Vt. 610, 611 (1993): ""This Court will not look beyond the statute itself in an effort to determine whether any contrary legislative intent exists when the statutory language itself is clear and unambiguous."" Citing Cavanaugh v. Abbott Laboratories, 145 Vt. 516, 529 (1985) (""If confusion or ambiguity does not appear, then the statute is not construed, but rather is enforced in accordance with its express terms. Heisse v. State, 143 Vt. 87, 89 (1983)""). And see In   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 4  re Burlington Housing Authority, 143 Vt. 80, 83 (1983) (""This Court has consistently held that when the meaning of a statute is plain and unambiguous on its face, it must be enforced according to its express terms without resort to construction."") Catamount Slate makes no argument in its motion that 6081(l)(3) is unclear and ambiguous. 1 Rather, its Memorandum discusses a portion of the legislative history of the provision, the implication being that this is always an appropriate means by which to understand a statute's express language. While an examination of legislative history, when appropriate, can lead to clarification of ambiguous and unclear terms in a statute, legislative history in Vermont is sparse. Unlike the United States Congress, the Vermont legislature does not publish written analyses or explanations of its legislation from the House and Senate Committees which hold hearings on proposed legislation or from conference committees which could be of use in understanding its intent. At most, transcripts from committee hearings can be examined, but the Board finds that such an examination can be a somewhat dubious exercise; there is sometimes a question in the transcript as to who is speaking, transcripts do not always reflect what draft version of a bill is being considered by a particular committee on a particular day, and discrete passages, if taken out of context or edited, can be misleading. The Board must therefore carefully approach any attempt to discern the meaning of a particular law through a reading of isolated transcripts or testimony. Even if the Board does consider the legislative testimony cited by Catamount Slate, despite EBR 31(A)(1)'s prohibition on new evidence and arguments,2 it affords no support for Catamount Slate's positions. a. Legislative history cited by Catamount Slate  1  ""A mere assertion that certain language could have a different meaning does not compel the Board to conclude that the statute is not clear."" Nextel Communications of the Mid-Atlantic d/b/a/ Nextel Communications, Declaratory Ruling #362, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 17 (Nov. 18, 1998). Catamount Slate does not even make this assertion. 2  Motions to reconsider or alter decisions of the Board cannot be used to present new evidence, Van Sicklen Limited Partnership, 4C1013R-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 3 (July 26, 2001); North Country Animal League, #5L0487-4-EB, Memorandum of Decision (Apr. 20, 2000), or new argument. Upper Valley Regional Landfill, #3R0609-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 7 (Nov. 12, 1991).   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 5  In furtherance of its arguments, Catamount Slate has provided transcripts of testimony before the Vermont House Natural Resources and Energy Committee from March 23 and 27, 1995 on H. 331, the bill that was the precursor to Act 30 (1995), which established the slate quarry exemption sought here by Catamount Slate. 3 Catamount Slate presents the following certain, discrete (and edited) language in the testimony before the Committee to support a contention that Jurisdictional Opinions for slate quarries were intended to be treated differently from all other Jurisdictional Opinions: REP. BEYER: Findings of Fact contained in certified registration shall not be subject to later challenge, if not appealed within 30 days of issuance, and we provided last year a thought (sic) with an advisory opinions and also a mechanism to make those final.... If nobody challenges it, then there's a mechanism where after 30 days its going to be final and done and case closed. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 28). Unfortunately, Catamount Slate's citation does not include everything that Rep. Beyer said. The full quotation (highlighting those part omitted by Catamount Slate in its Memorandum) is: REP. BEYER: In my mind, this really is like an advisory opinion and the language that is suggested by the Board treats like (sic) an advisory opinion and does, say, though, it's not final. It provides 30 days. Findings of Fact contained in certified registration shall not be subject to later challenge, if not appealed within 30 days of issuance, and we provided last year a thought (sic) with an advisory opinions and also a mechanism to make those final. So there is a way to get to know, to get to the answer, and I think this language does do that, and I think there should be a process where someone can say, that hole wasn't there, but they've got to prove that it wasn't there. You can't just rely on the applicant submitting registration information. If nobody challenges  3  In addition to the difficulties that legislative history, the history provided Slate has not informed the Board as to further provide an understanding as to passed.  arise when transcripts form the sole basis for by Catamount Slate is incomplete. Catamount subsequent developments of H. 331, which can the bill that the House and the Senate ultimately   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 6  it, then there's a mechanism where after 30 days its going to be final and done and case closed. Reading the full quotation makes it clear that Rep. Beyer was referring to the fact that the legislature had, ""last year,"" (i.e. in 1994) revised 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) to establish a process to ensure the finality of Jurisdictional Opinions. See Act 232, 25 (1993 Adj. Sess.) Clearly, this is the ""mechanism to make those [Jurisdictional Opinions] final"" to which Rep Beyer refers. It is also apparent that Rep. Beyer also was concerned that parties other than the slate quarry registrant be permitted to participate in the process of determining whether an exemption from Act 250 is warranted: "" You can't just rely on the applicant submitting registration information."" Notably, there is nothing in Rep. Beyer's comments to suggest, as Catamount Slate argues, that slate quarry registrations were to be handled in a manner different than the ordinary 6007 process. Catamount Slate also presents the following exchange between an unknown Committee member and John Ewing, then Chair of the Environmental Board: -----: I register and 30 days later nobody comes forward, it's just, nobody can come forward. Am I correct, John? MR. EWING: That's correct  House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 30). Catamount Slate asks the Board to find that Ewing intended that a registration, with no notice to anyone, can become final as to the world with the simple passage of 30 days. Ewing's comments however, must be understood within the context of Rep. Beyer's statement that had occurred only minutes before. Further, it is clear from a reading of the entire Transcript that Ewing had been a consistent advocate for the application of the normal 6007 process to slate quarry registrations. b. Other transcript passages and legislative history, not presented by Catamount Slate That the House Committee intended the standard 6007 Jurisdictional Opinion process to apply to slate quarry registrations is apparent from the vote that the Committee took soon after Rep. Beyer's comments:   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 7  REP. McCORMACK: the registration process? -----:  Okay, so we are ready to vote on  Can we hear the motion again?  -----: You moved that we use the standard Act 250 district commission process for registration. -----: Point of inquiry, is that essentially the language, your language proposed has that effect, correct? -----: Our proposed language does. ......  REP. McCORMACK: Anymore discussion? All those in favor please raise your hands. It's unanimous. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 35). The Board further notes that the bill that the House Committee presented to the entire House contained the following proposed language to be added as 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3): (3) Quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. The board may order amendments to a quarry registration document , to the extent necessary to ensure its accuracy. Information contained in a quarry registration document shall not be subject to later challenge, after a final determination is reached under subsection 6007(c) of this title. House Journal, March 29, 1995 at 16 (emphasis added). The following day, Representative Corren moved to strike ""all after the first sentence"" in the proposed 6081(l)(3), which was agreed to. House Journal, March 30, 1995 at 2. Thus, what legislative history that there is indicates that the House did not intend that slate quarry registrations achieve the finality status urged by Catamount Slate. If anything, the contrary is apparent from the votes on the House floor. When the Senate addressed the bill, the language from the Corren amendment was not changed. Thus, ultimately, a simple, direct reference to the 6007(c) process, and nothing more, appears in the slate registration statute. The ""inconclusive   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 8  legislative history"" relied on by the Catamount Slate is thus ""insufficient to overcome the plain meaning"" of the statutes at issue. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 360, 373-74 (1995). c. Act 250's obligation to publish notice of the slate quarry registration Catamount Slate next argues that ""if the Act 250 process was utilized instead of registration through a town clerk notice would be provided to all through publication as the following process would be followed...."" Catamount Slate then cites to testimony by John Ewing, earlier in the March 27 Committee hearing, which implies that, at one point, the process for slate quarry registrations might have followed a different path from that which ultimately appears in the statute: MR. EWING: They file a notice of registration, okay, and then we go through a normal process of publication and simplified procedure, and then we would certify that registration and then file that with the town clerk, and the way it's written, it would be filed in the town record. So that at that point, it would become more of a public record so that people would know and can hear that it's happened, plus there would be notice to everybody. House Natural Resources and Energy Committee March 27, 1995 (Transcript at 26). Catamount Slate uses the above testimony by Mr. Ewing to make the claim that ""Because of the failure of this District Coordinator to publish notice as required under 10 V.S.A. 6084 the Coordinator is Estopped from denying finality of JO #1-S-50."" This argument has no merit. The fact that alternative registration processes may have been discussed as the slate quarry bill made its way through the legislature is irrelevant. The bill that ultimately passed and became law is what governs. As noted, that law states that the standard 6007(c) Jurisdictional Opinion process is to be used. There is nothing in 6007(c) that imposes on a Coordinator any obligation under 6084 to publish notice of the issuance of a Jurisdictional Opinion. References to 10 V.S.A. 6084 appear twice in 6007(c). 4 If the person who has requested the Jurisdictional Opinion ""wishes a final determination to be rendered, the district coordinator, at the expense of the requestor and in accordance with the rules 4  The second reference to 6084, not relevant to the present discussion, appears in 6007(c) within the list of those persons who are permitted to appeal a Jurisdictional Opinion to the Board.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 9  of the board shall serve the opinion"" on a certain group of individuals, some of whom are described by reference to 6084. 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) (emphasis added). However, as the Board has noted twice before in its Memoranda of Decision issued on this particular issue: First, if the person who requests a Jurisdictional Opinion wants others to be bound by it, it is incumbent upon that person to make this desire known to the Coordinator, to provide the Coordinator with the names of those persons to be served with the Jurisdictional Opinion, and to pay for such service. The Coordinator has no independent obligation to provide notice to others who have not appeared or participated in the Jurisdictional Opinion process, either by service or publication, of the Opinion. Second, to be bound by a Jurisdictional Opinion, a person must be served with it. July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 8 - 9, quoting the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 - 11. Catamount Slate has presented no evidence or argument that it ever requested that JO #1-S-50 be served on anyone. 5 Thus, any obligations that may have been placed on the Coordinator's shoulders (and such obligations do not include the obligation ""to publish notice as required under 10 V.S.A. 6084"") have never been triggered. B. Catamount Slate's Request for Ruling on New Issues  Catamount Slate has also asked that the Board rule on a series of issues that it believes are raised as a result of its conclusion in its earlier Memoranda of Decision that because under 6007(c), ""any person ... may request a jurisdictional opinion from the 5  Catamount Slate implies (Memorandum at 5) that its simple submission of its registration documents pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3), by itself, imposed an obligation on the Coordinator to serve JO #1-S-50 on all parties and affected persons. But that section's direct reference to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) informs the registrant that, if he wishes finality for any Jurisdictional Opinion that may be issued, there is a specific procedure that he must follow: he must inform the Coordinator of his wish for finality, he must provide the Coordinator with the names of those he wishes to be notified, and he must pay for service on those whom he wishes to be bound by the opinion. Catamount Slate took none of these actions.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 10  district coordinator concerning the applicability of this chapter,"" ""[i]n some respects, under the statute, no Jurisdictional Opinion issued by a Coordinator can ever be considered to be absolutely final as regards the world."" July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 9, quoting the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 - 11. Catamount Slate asks the Board to rule on: a. Whether the Environmental Board through its rule making authority had a duty to implement the intent of the legislature and provide a workable finality procedure for Jurisdictional Opinions relative to Slate Quarry registrations. b. Whether the Environmental Board breached its duty through its rule making authority to provide a workable finality procedure for jurisdictional opinions. c. Whether the Environmental Board Rules preclude rather than provide finality, thus compromising the substantive requirements of 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) as incorporated by 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3) concerning the finality of jurisdictional opinions of registered quarries. d. Does the failure of the Board's regulatory scheme to enable the identification of affected persons with promptness and specificity require that service upon and appeal by ""persons/entities affected by the outcome"" be disregarded as an impediment to finality determinations which the Legislature contemplated for Slate quarry Jurisdictional Opinion (sic) under 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Catamount Slate Request at 3 - 4. W hether the Board has the duties alleged by Catamount Slate, whether the Board breached those duties, whether the Board's rules are contrary to the intent of the legislature, whether the Board's rules or ""regulatory scheme"" are flawed or fraught with failure, and what should be the remedy for such flaws and failures, is not for the Board to decide. While the Board has certain powers to determine ""the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the [Board],"" 3 V.S.A. 808, the validity of a rule may only be determined ""in an action for a declaratory judgment in the Washington superior court...."" 3 V.S.A. 807. In its own defense, the Board will note, however, that, as it pointed out in its July 27, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 9, the finality problem suffered by Catamount   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 11  Slate ""is not an impediment to Catamount Slate's position that the Board has artificially erected; Catamount Slate's difficulties in this regard arise out of the language of 6007(c)."" It is the statute that allows ""any person"" (who is not otherwise barred by the statute's finality provisions) to seek a Jurisdictional Opinion, presumably at any time; 6 Environmental Board Rule 3(C)(1) merely parrots the statutory language. Indeed, were the Board to promulgate rules which abrogated these statutory rights, to the benefit of the slate quarry industry or anyone else, the Board's rules would be subject to attack as contrary to the plain language of the section. C. The Neighbors' request for an extension of time in which to file Exhibit N20.  The Neighbors have submitted some aerial photographs, but had trouble securing one photograph (Exhibit N20) and therefore missed the August 29, 2001 filing date. In their August 28, 2001 filing, they explain the reason for the difficulty in obtaining the photograph and ask that they be allowed until September 7, 2001 to file Exhibit N20. Catamount Slate has not opposed this request. The Board grants the Neighbors' request and allows the late filing of Exhibit N20. D. The Neighbors' subpoena requests  The Neighbors ask the Board to subpoena three witnesses: William Burke, the Commission Coordinator; Larry Becker, State Geologist; and Caryl Philip Adams, the Fair Haven Zoning Administrator (see Exhibits N31, N33 and N34). The Board has reviewed the parties' pre-hearing filings and finds, at present, that only Burke's presence at the hearing may provide evidence which will assist the Board in its determination of the merits of this case. In particular, since Burke took a site visit to the Catamount Slate land in April 2000, his observations as to what he saw at that time and what he may see during the Board's scheduled site visit on October 3, 2001 may assist the Board in this matter. The Board therefore grants the Neighbors' request as to Burke and denies the Neighbors' request as to Becker and Adams. The Board further questions Catamount Slate's claim that ""[T]he language of the statute does not contemplate that service upon some, but not all parties or affected persons, renders finality only upon those served."" Memorandum at 6. Service under 6007(c) is clearly intended to put a person on notice that, if he disagrees with the Jurisdictional Opinion, he had better seek reconsideration of or appeal that opinion or forever be bound by it. Certainly, the statute cannot be read to mean that those who are not served  those who have no idea that a Jurisdictional Opinion exists that finds a slate quarry to be exempt from Act 250  are also so bound. Due process concepts of notice and the opportunity to be heard must dictate otherwise. 6   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 12  III.

RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling Petition #389  Memorandum of Decision This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (""Petition"") from a Jurisdictional Opinion (""JO"") concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On June 29, 2000, the Environmental Board (""Board"") issued a Memorandum of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. That Memorandum of Decision contains the relevant Procedural History up to that date. On July 13, 2001, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products (collectively, ""Catamount Slate"") filed a Motion to Reconsider the June 29 Memorandum of Decision, seeking a new decision on the following Preliminary Issue: 1. Whether the Coordinator for the District 1 Environmental Commission had authority to issue Jurisdictional Opinion 1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration), pursuant to 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) and EBR 3(C). On July 16, 2001, Catamount Slate filed a Motion for Permission to Take an Interlocutory Appeal and a Motion to Stay Proceedings. On July 23, 2001, Joanne and David Calvi filed a response to Catamount Slate's Motion to Reconsider. The Board deliberated on all pending motions on July 25, 2001.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 2  II.  Discussion A. Motion to Reconsider 1. Whether service on Emily Joselson is service on the neighbors; whether the Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1 .  Pursuant to EBR 31(A), motions to reconsider or alter decisions of the Board generally cannot be used to present new evidence, North Country Animal League, #5L0487-4-EB, Memorandum of Decision at (Apr. 20, 2000), or new argument, Upper Valley Regional Landfill, #3R0609-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 7 (Nov. 12, 1991), or to reconsider matters not initially considered. Black River Valley Rod & Gun Club, Inc., #2S1019-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 (June 12, 1997). And see Finard-Zamias Associates, et al., #1R0661-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 (Jan. 16, 1991) (""This interpretation is based on the need to maintain the integrity of the Board's appeal process by ensuring that arguments and evidence are introduced prior to final decision."") The claim by Catamount Slate that Joselson represented neighbors to this Project (David and Joanne Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter, and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse (hereinafter the ""Neighbors"")) before the Town of Fair Haven Zoning Board of Adjustment (""ZBA"") is a new claim, supported with new evidence. Prior to Catamount Slate's July 13 filings, the only evidence that the Board had was a Notice of Appeal from the ZBA decision to the Environmental Court filed by Ren Barlow. Catamount Slate has now provided Exhibit A, which shows that Emily Joselson signed an October 7, 1999 Certificate of Service concerning the Notice of Appeal to the Environmental Court of behalf of the Neighbors. Catamount Slate presents new evidence and makes new argument in its motion as to Joselson's representation. Its motion, in this regard, is therefore improper and is thus denied. Even if the Board were to address the merits of Catamount Slate's motion, it would find them to be without merit. Catamount Slate's arguments: Catamount Slate makes a series of arguments as to why the District 1 Environmental Commission Coordinator (""Coordinator"") did not have the authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2. These arguments focus on a claim that the Neighbors are timebarred from appeal as they had notice or were served with JO #1-S-50-1 and did not seek a timely   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 3  reconsideration of that JO. Thus, Catamount Slate contends that the Coordinator was without authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2. The Board has heard some of these arguments before. Boiled down to their basics, Catamount Slate makes the following claims: a. that notice to an attorney is notice to that attorney's clients  1. Emily Joselson and Rendall Barlow, who are members of the same law firm, have represented the Neighbors since at least their appeal of a conditional use permit issued by the ZBA relative to the Catamount Slate quarry, which the ZBA refers to as a ""State of Vermont registered quarry site."" 2. All of the parties who requested reconsideration of JO #1-S-50-1 are the same as those who appealed the ZBA decision. 3. #1-S-50-1. 4. The land involved in the ZBA decision is the same as the land involved in JO  JO #1-S-50-1 was served on attorney Emily Joselson.  5. Notice to an attorney or ""to an attorney's office ... qualifies as notice to the client."" Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 92 (1990). 1 1  The Irwin decision explains: Under our system of representative litigation, ""each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have 'notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.' "" Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (quoting Smith v. Ayer, 101 U.S. 320, 326, 25 L.Ed. 955 (1880)). Congress has endorsed this sensible practice in the analogous provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide that ""[w]henever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party represented by an attorney the service shall be made upon the attorney unless service upon the party is ordered by the court."" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(b). To read the term ""receipt"" to mean only ""actual receipt by the claimant"" would render the practice of notification through counsel a meaningless exercise. If Congress intends to depart from the common and established practice of providing notification through   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 4  b.  that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the JO process  6. It is clear that Barlow and Joselson represented the Neighbors in JO #1-S50-1 because there would otherwise have been no reason to serve Joselson with the JO. Since it is standard office procedure to serve attorneys who the Coordinator learns are representing ""interested persons,"" it can be surmised that Joselson was served because the Coordinator had determined that she was such an attorney. Joselson was served because she represented parties interested or affected by the outcome of JO #1-S-50-1. 7. In light of the fact that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the ZBA appeal, service of JO #1-S-50-1 on Joselson is service on the clients of her firm. c. The Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1  8. The Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1. This is all that is required under the Vermont Supreme Court's decision in In re Great Waters of America, 140 Vt. 105, 109 (1981). Joanne and David Calvi's response to Catamount Slate's arguments: Joanne and David Calvi have a filed a response to Catamount Slate's arguments. The Calvis state that, while Ms. Joselson did represent them and others in the ZBA matter counsel, it must do so expressly. See Decker v. Anheuser-Busch, 632 F.2d 1221, 1224 (CA5 1980). We also reject Irwin's contention that there is a material difference between receipt by an attorney and receipt by that attorney's office for purposes of  2000e-16(c). The lower federal courts have consistently held that notice to an attorney's office which is acknowledged by a representative of that office qualifies as notice to the client. See Ringgold v. National Maintenance Corp., 796 F.2d 769 (CA5 1986); Josiah-Faeduwor v. Communications Satellite Corp., 251 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 785 F.2d 344 (1986). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b) also permits notice to a litigant to be made by delivery of papers to the litigant's attorney's office. The practical effect of a contrary rule would be to encourage factual disputes about when actual notice was received, and thereby create uncertainty in an area of the law where certainty is much to be desired.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 5  and was a part of the mediation process in this matter, her firm was not ""retained to pursue actions in the Vermont Environmental Board or the Act 250 process."" Discussion of Catamount Slate's arguments: Ordinarily, service on or notice to an attorney is equivalent to service or notice on that attorney's clients, see V.R.C.P. 5(b). But this argument begs the question as to whether Joselson was the Neighbors' attorney for purposes of the JO proceedings. In Irwin, this was not an issue; the decision specifically states: ""There is no question but that petitioner appeared by his attorney in the EEOC proceeding."" 498 U.S. at 92. Interestingly, this was the question in the Vermont Supreme Court case which the Board cited in its June 29 Memorandum of Decision and to which Catamount Slate refers in its present argument. In Agency of Natural Resources v. Towns, 168 Vt. 449 (1998), the question was whether, when a phone call was made alerting the Attorney General's Office to an illegal waste site, this constituted notice to the Agency of Natural Resources (""ANR"") of the existence of the site. If it did, then ANR's later action to compel the cleanup of the site would have been barred by the statute of limitations. The Court's decision makes it clear that the question whether an attorney is a person's representative is a question of fact. Thus, even if the Board accepts Catamount Slate's first five statements as true, there is no evidence in the record before the Board, as there was in Irwin, that the Neighbors ""appeared by their attorney"" in the Jurisdictional Opinion proceedings. As to Catamount Slate's second claim - that Joselson represented the Neighbors in the JO process - the Board has no way of knowing why JO #1-S-50-1 was served on Joselson; she may have expressed an interest to the Coordinator to see anything he issued, as it could play some role in the ZBA appeal. While, no doubt, the connections between the JOs and the ZBA appeal are facially apparent, it is a stretch to infer that Joselson's representation of the Neighbors in the ZBA case equates to her representation in the JO series and thus service on her equates to service on the Neighbors. Whether Joselson represented the Neighbors on the JO proceedings is a question of fact, and the Board finds that Catamount Slate has presented insufficient evidence to allow the Board to find that Joselson, or any other member of her firm, acted as the Neighbors' representative or attorney in the JO proceedings before the Coordinator. Finally, as to Catamount Slate's claim that the Neighbors had actual notice of JO #1-S-50-1 and that this is all that is required under the Vermont Supreme Court's Great   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 6  Waters decision: this argument ignores the Board's analysis in the June 29 Memorandum of Decision on this point: The problem with this argument is inherent in the language of the statute: ""If the requestor wishes a final determination to be rendered on the question [of jurisdiction], the district coordinator ... shall serve the opinion [on interested parties]...."" (Emphasis added). Service is effectuated, under Board policy, by the mailing of a Jurisdictional Opinion to a person. And see 10 V.S.A. 6007(c) (appeal to the Board from a Jurisdictional Opinion must be taken within 30 days of ""the mailing of the opinion""); EBR 3(C)(3) and 12(J). That a person may have had actual notice or might otherwise have become aware of a Jurisdictional Opinion is immaterial; for a Jurisdictional Opinion to be binding on a person, the law requires that it be served on him. Nor does the Board find the Great Waters case to be apposite here. That case addressed only the question of whether the constitution required actual notice that an application had been submitted to a District Commission be given to an adjoining landowner; the Court held that, as an adjoiner has no constitutionally protected liberty or property rights to notice or to participate in Act 250 cases, but has only those rights that the legislature has granted to him, actual notice of an application is not constitutionally required. Notice, however, is different from service, and, in 6007(c) the legislature has specifically stated that only those persons who are served with a Jurisdictional Opinion will be bound by it. Memorandum of Decision at 6  7. Catamount Slate provides no reason as to why the Board's earlier analysis is somehow incorrect. 2. A decision on a quarry registration is a ""final determination"" that is subject to different rules than those which apply to ordinary JOs.  Catamount Slate's arguments on this point are new and perhaps should have been made in its initial May 31, 2001 filings. However, they can also be considered to be arguments which are made in response to the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision, and the Board does not therefore consider them to be barred under EBR 31(A). See, Nehemiah Associates, Inc., #1R0672-1-EB, Memorandum of Decision at 2 - 3 (Oct. 3, 1995) (new arguments are not acceptable, with the exception that parties may present argument ""about matters they could not reasonably have known about before."")   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 7  Catamount Slate's arguments: Catamount Slate argues that: 1. Quarry registrations are entitled to a finality status that is different from other JOs. Catamount Slate has not had the advantage of this finality. 2. The legislature placed an obligation on the Board to determine how this finality should be accomplished; it can be accomplished by service, by publication, by personal service, or evidence of actual notice. 3. There is no notice on the registration form that quarry registration decisions could be subject to reopening, and the legislature could not have conceived that this could occur. 4. The quarry registration form requires that only adjoiners, the town and other statutory parties be served. 5. Catamount Slate relied on the quarry registration form when filling it out.  6. The interested parties had adequate opportunity to participate in the decision-making process concerning the quarry registration. 2 7. Two state representatives, Ira Pike and Fred Maslack, state by affidavit that it is their understanding that the slate quarry exemption statute, 10 V.S.A.  6081(l), would allow a quarry owner to obtain a ""final determination"" that would not be subject to later attack. Discussion of Catamount Slate's arguments: It is unclear, from a reading of the statute, where Catamount Slate finds a legislative intent to somehow make a special case for the finality of quarry registrations different from those which are afforded to other JOs. The slate quarry exemption statute, reads, in pertinent part: 2  Of course, if as Catamount Slate argues, it was not required to serve these persons with its application, it is somewhat difficult to see how they would have known to participate.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 8  (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter. (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(3) and (4). While the Board recognizes that both subsections (3) and (4) of 6081(l)(3) and (4) use the words ""final determination,""3 it is apparent from the plain language of these subsections and their direct references to the ""provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title"" that the legislature intended the JO process to apply to slate quarry registrations in the same manner as they apply to other JOs. Nothing in 6081(l)(3) and (4) indicates that there is to be special or preferential treatment of such registrations. As the Board summarized its conclusions in its June 29 Memorandum of Decision, 6007(c) and Environmental Board Rule 3(C)(1) make its clear that First, if the person who requests a Jurisdictional Opinion wants others to be bound by it, it is incumbent upon that person to make this desire known to the Coordinator, to provide the Coordinator with the names of those persons to be served with the Jurisdictional Opinion, 3  Under subsection (3), a person may submit quarry registration documents to the District Commission and a request for a JO to the Coordinator, as provided by 10 V.S.A. 6007(c). Whether such a request for a JO becomes a ""final determination"" is governed by the provisions of 6007(c). Likewise, the Board reads the words, ""final determination"" in subsection (4) to mean that, when a person receives a JO that is not appealed, it must be filed in the land records. But subsection (4) should not be read to implicitly amend 6007(c) by giving special status to slate quarry registrations. Amendments of statutes by implication are not favored. United States v. Welden, 337 U.S. 95, 102 n.12 (1964); and see State Agency of Natural Resources v. Riendeau, 157 Vt. 615, 620 (1991) (repeals by implication are disfavored).   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 9  and to pay for such service. The Coordinator has no independent obligation to provide notice to others who have not appeared or participated in the Jurisdictional Opinion process, either by service or publication, of the Opinion. Second, to be bound by a Jurisdictional Opinion, a person must be served with it. [4 ] Lastly, even if service is made upon many people, the finality of a Jurisdictional Opinion cannot be guaranteed. Section 6007(c) reads, ""With respect to the partition or division of land, or with respect to an activity which might or might not constitute development, any person ... may request a jurisdictional opinion from the district coordinator concerning the applicability of this chapter."" (Emphasis added) Thus, in some respects, under the statute, no Jurisdictional Opinion issued by a Coordinator can ever be considered to be absolutely final as regards the world. June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision at 10 11. This is not an impediment to Catamount Slate's position that the Board has artificially erected; Catamount Slate's difficulties in this regard arise out of the language of 6007(c). Thus, if slate quarry registrations are not entitled to any special ""finality"" status, there is likewise no obligation for the Board to provide such status by providing some sort of notice or service on persons beyond that which is provided for in 6007(c). The affidavits of the two state representatives are problematic in two respects. First, they constitute new evidence, something which is generally not allowed within the context of a reconsideration motion. EBR 31(A)(1). Second, ""The remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history."" Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311 (1978). See also State of Vermont v. Brinegar, 379 F. Supp. 606, 611 (D. Vt. 1974).  4  Thus, while Catamount Slate may be correct in noting that the registration form requires that only certain entities be served, this does not mean that other persons, who are not served with the Jurisdictional Opinion request, are somehow bound by a determination about which they know nothing.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 10  B.  Motion to Take Interlocutory Appeal  Under the Vermont Rules of Appellate Procedure (""VRAP"") 5, a party which wishes to take an interlocutory appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court from a trial court or an administrative body must first seek permission from the lower tribunal. Catamount Slate's present motion is such a request. The Vermont Supreme Court has written: Interlocutory appeals are an exception to the normal restriction of appellate jurisdiction to the review of final judgments. There are weighty considerations that support the finality requirement. Piecemeal appellate review causes unnecessary delay and expense, and wastes scarce judicial resources. Furthermore, an appellate court labors under great disadvantages in disposing of interlocutory appeals. We are deprived of the benefits of a final trial court opinion. Interlocutory review requires us to decide legal questions in a vacuum, without benefit of factual findings. Appellate decisionmaking suffers from such abstractness. By its very nature then, interlocutory appeals impair this Court's basic functions of correctly interpreting the law and providing justice for all litigants. Despite those hazards, there is a narrow class of cases in which interlocutory review is nonetheless advisable. In re Pyramid Co. of Burlington, 141 Vt. 294, 300 - 01 (1982) (internal citation omitted). The Vermont Supreme Court has held that ""Interlocutory appeal is appropriate for questions of law, not fact,"" because a question of law ""is one capable if accurate resolution by an appellate court without the benefit of a factual record. If factual distinctions could control the legal result, the issue is not an appropriate subject for interlocutory appeal."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 304. And see State v. Dubois, 150 Vt. 600 (1988). As noted, whether Emily Joselson represent the Neighbors in the JO process, at least as of the time that JO #1-S-50-1 was served is a question of fact. Thus, the question of whether the appearance of Joselson's name on the Certificate of Service for JO #1-S50-1 constitutes notice of JO #1-S-50-1 to the Neighbors is not an appropriate question for interlocutory appeal. 5 5  The Board notes that Catamount Slate has not presented evidence on this question beyond the documents it has submitted.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 11  1.  Interlocutory appeal elements  There are three factors which a party seeking to take an interlocutory appeal must demonstrate. First, the party must show that the order appealed from (here the Board's June 29, 2001 Memorandum of Decision or the Board's decision on Catamount Slate's pending reconsideration motion) involves a ""controlling question of law;"" second there must be a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion"" as to the correctness of that order; and third, an interlocutory appeal should ""materially advance the termination of the litigation."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 301; State v. Wheel, 148 Vt. 439 (1987); VRAP 5(b). Repeating the arguments as to finality and notice that it made both in its initial May 31, 2001 filings and its July 13, 2001 arguments in favor of its reconsideration motion, Catamount Slate presents its reasons as to why the question of law which it wishes to present to the Supreme Court is one which is both ""controlling"" and as to which there is a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion;"" it then argues that the litigation will terminate if it is successful. a. ""controlling question of law""  A question is ""controlling"" when it governs the outcome of the litigation. State v. Wheel. It may also be ""controlling"" if reversal would have ""a substantial impact on the litigation, either by saving substantial litigation time, or by significantly narrowing the range of issues, claims or defenses at trial."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 303. Here, if Catamount Slate is right, and the Neighbors are time-barred from seeking reconsideration of JO #1-S-501(for any or all of the legal  but not factual - reasons argued by Catamount Slate), then this litigation would end, and the question would be ""controlling."" Likewise, were slate quarry registration requests to be accorded special status which somehow removes them from the ordinary JOs addressed in 10 V.S.A. 6007(c), this question of law might also be ""controlling."" b. ""substantial ground for difference of opinion""  Whether there is a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion"" depends on whether the Board believes that ""a reasonable appellate judge could vote for reversal of the challenged order."" Pyramid, 141 at 307 (citation and internal quotes omitted). 6 ""Unless an order triggers this degree of doubt in the mind of a trial judge, certification [to 6  Interestingly, the Supreme Court has held that the vehemence of a disagreeing attorney's arguments is not relevant to the inquiry. Id. at 306.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 12  allow the interlocutory appeal] is improper."" Id. Finally, the Supreme Court notes that a denial of permission to take an interlocutory appeal is itself appealable, thereby ""assuring that the doubtfulness of trial court rulings can be evaluated by an independent arbiter after the denial of certification."" Id. The Board does not find doubt in its decision which rises to the level appropriate to satisfy this element and justify interlocutory review. c. ""the potential to materially advance the termination of the litigation""  ""An interlocutory appeal is proper only if it may advance the ultimate termination of a case."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 305 (emphasis in original). And in deciding whether to grant an interlocutory appeal, the trial court ""must consider not only the time saved at trial, but also the time expended on appeal,"" State v. Lafayette, 148 Vt. 288, 290 (1987), quoting Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 305, both the appeal time expended in the interlocutory appeal and the appeal of the final order. Indeed, the Supreme Court found in the Pyramid case that the trial court could have foreseen that its final decision would be appealed, regardless of the Supreme Court's resolution of the interlocutory appeal, and, therefore, ""certification [of the interlocutory appeal] has probably assured an even greater delay."" Pyramid, 141 Vt. at 306. The Board must balance several considerations. On the side of granting Catamount Slate's motion for interlocutory review is the possibility that a holding by the Supreme Court that the Neighbors are time-barred from seeking reconsideration of JO #1-S-50-1 and that the Coordinator did not have the independent authority to issue JO #1-S-50-2, sua sponte; will terminate this litigation, and the Board will never reach the merits. Likewise, a holding that slate quarry registrations are entitled to some sort of special finality status which removes registration decisions from the ordinary context of 6007(c) may also lead to the end of this matter. Finally, the Board is mindful of the wasted cost to the parties of going forward with this case, should the Court ultimately decide that it should have been dismissed today. On the other hand, the Board must consider that the hearing in this case is scheduled for October 3, 2001, and it is likely that the Board will be able to deliberate and issue a decision before the end of the year, if this case proceeds as presently scheduled. Further, the Board may ultimately find in Catamount Slate's favor on the merits of the ultimate question of its exempt status, thus terminating this litigation, causing all of Catamount Slate's procedural arguments to be moot, and causing any time or resources spent in the Supreme Court on interlocutory appeal to have been wasted. Finally, an   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 13  interlocutory appeal to the Court will take time, and unless the appeal were to be placed on an expedited schedule, the Board believes it unlikely that the Court would be able to hear and decide the appeal within the next several months. On balance, the Board concludes that less waste of time and resources will be likely if this matter proceeds to a hearing before the Board as scheduled. In sum, therefore, the Board does not find that Catamount Slate has presented adequate grounds for interlocutory review, and it therefore denies Catamount Slate's motion. 7  7  There is one other element in the consideration of whether to allow an interlocutory appeal which does not appear in VRAP 5 but which has played a role in the Supreme Court's determination of at least one case  prejudice to the parties. In In re C.H., 151 Vt. 310 (1989), the Court waived strict adherence to the required elements of VRAP 5(b) because it found that having to wait to appeal until a final judgment had been reached could result in ""substantial injuries"" to the party seeking interlocutory review. Our Supreme Court has never specifically looked to the prejudice that could result to a party who had to wait until an interlocutory appeal had been heard before receiving a final decision on the merits, but that prejudice is potentially present in this matter. Currently, even though Act 250 jurisdiction over Catamount Slate's quarry has been determined in JO #1-S-50-2, Catamount Slate continues to operate its quarry and to the possible detriment of the Neighbors. The delay that will result from allowing this interlocutory appeal, even if Catamount Slate is unsuccessful in such an appeal, will inure to Catamount Slate's benefit and a concomitant potential harm to the Neighbors. This delay may also be prejudicial to Act 250 itself, as the longer Catamount Slate can avoid a final decision on the merits, the longer it can operate its quarry in the face of a JO. The Board's decision to deny Catamount Slate's motion, however, does not depend on a finding of prejudice to the Neighbors or to Act 250.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling Petition #389 Memorandum of Decision Page 14  C.  Motion to Stay Proceedings  The parties' initial filings (prefiled testimony and Exhibits) are due on August 1, 2001. Catamount Slate asks the Board to stay its proceedings until such time as the Board rules on Catamount Slate's interlocutory appeal motion. As the Board has today denied Catamount Slate's motion, the stay request is moot.  III.  Order Catamount Slate's motions are denied.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 27th day of July 2001.

GX270-51-2510634	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling #389  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (Petition) from a Jurisdictional Opinion concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On July 21, 2000, District #1 Environmental Commission (Commission) Coordinator William Burke (Coordinator) issued Jurisdictional Opinion #1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration) (JO) in which he determined that commercial extraction of slate from four slate quarry holes on a  122-acre tract located off Inman Pond Road in the Town of Fair Haven (Project) requires a permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250). On August 9, 2000, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., (collectively, Catamount Slate) filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO. On August 29, 2000, the General Counsel for the Board issued a Notice of Prehearing Conference and Petition for Declaratory Ruling, informing those individuals who had received notice of the JO that the Petition had been filed and setting a date and time for the Prehearing Conference in this matter for September 14, 2000 at 2:00 p.m. On September 7, 2000, James Leary, Esq., the attorney for Catamount Slate at that time, informed the Board by letter that Catamount Slate and neighboring landowners, following mediation, ""appear to have reached a resolution of the issues"" underlying the Petition. Leary's letter noted that settlement documents were being drafted and stated further that he anticipated ""that Catamount Slate will withdraw its appeal after the necessary documents have been executed by the appropriate persons."" Leary therefore requested that the scheduled September 14 Prehearing Conference be continued ""pending the withdrawal of the appeal.""   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 2  On September 7, 2000, in response to Leary's letter, Board Chair Marcy Harding issued an Order, continuing the Prehearing Conference to October 13, 2000. The Chair's Order required that any further request for a continuance be filed no later than October 5, 2000. On October 3, 2000, Leary filed a second request for a continuance, noting again that the parties were continuing their attempts at a non-adversarial resolution of this matter. Leary stated that, as a part of the settlement, Catamount Slate would seek an Act 250 permit for the quarry (and associated mill facility), and once a final permit had been obtained that incorporated the relevant terms of the global settlement, Catamount Slate would withdraw the instant appeal. Leary therefore requested that the Prehearing Conference in this matter be continued pending the issuance of a final Act 250 Permit by the Commission. On October 4, 2000, in response to Leary's request, the Chair issued an Order continuing this proceeding until the Commission issued a decision concerning the Land Use Permit application which Catamount Slate stated it intended to file. The Chair's Order required that on or before January 9, 2001, Catamount Slate file with the Board a status report concerning its application. In late February 2001, with the filing of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Leary, it came to the Board's attention that attempts at an informal resolution of the issues underlying the Petition had been unsuccessful and that this Petition might therefore need to be set for further proceedings. On May 1, 2001, the Chair held a status conference in this matter and determined that this case should be set for a Prehearing Conference. On May 22, 2001, the Chair convened a Prehearing Conference. On June 29, 2001, the Board issued Memoranda of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. Subsequent Memoranda were issued on July 27 and September 20, 2001, following reconsideration motions filed by Catamount Slate. Hearing was held on October 3, 2001 in Fair Haven, Vermont. Catamount Slate participated through its attorney, Stephanie Lorentz, Esq. Certain neighbors to the Project also participated: Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  On October 17, 2001, Catamount Slate filed two post-hearing motions. The motions ask (a) for the opportunity to provide rebuttal testimony to the testimony provided at the hearing by Coordinator William Burke, and (b) that the testimony of Joseph Badgewick be struck. The Board deliberated on this matter on October 17, November 14 and December 19, 2001. This matter is now ready for final decision.  II.  The Issue  The issue to be decided is ""Whether the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit.""  III.  Findings of Fact  To the extent any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are included below, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See, Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corporation, 167 Vt. 228, 241-42 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). 1 A. The quarry tract  1. Frederick Reed and Suellen Reed own a +/-122 acre parcel of land located on the northeasterly side of ""Old Marsh Pond"" in Fair Haven, Vermont. 2. Catamount Slate presently operates a slate quarry on the Reeds' Fair Haven land. 3. At one time, there were at least four small slate quarry pits on the Reed land; each of these four quarry pits was a separate and distinct pit, some distance from and unrelated to the others. There is present evidence of two of these quarry pits on the Reed land; the current quarrying operation has destroyed and subsumed the other two quarry pits. The Board makes its Findings of Fact based solely on evidence provided by Catamount Slate and observed at the site visit. Because the Board has not relied upon the testimony of William Burke or Joseph Badgewick, Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot. 1   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  4. Other pits, their ages unknown, exist on the Reed land; they do not appear to be natural holes. Waste slate or shale appears in or near some of these pits. B. The four quarry pits 1. the north pit  5. The northern-most quarry pit at issue in this case (the north pit) is located on the Reed land, several hundred yards to the northwest of the present quarry operation, near the east shore of Inman Pond. 6. The north pit is approximately 25 feet long, three to six feet wide, and four to six feet deep; slate pieces lie in the bottom of the pit. 7. Some of the walls of the north pit are flat; there are drill holes on the walls.  8. Brush grows on the sides of the north pit; no trees are growing in the pit, but there is a rotted out stump on the edge of the pit. 9. The area immediately around the north pit is a mixed deciduous forest which has been logged within the last 30 years. 10. Waste slate mounds appear around the north pit; some slate pieces are large; there is no uniformity of size and the pieces are odd shapes. One waste slate mound to the west of the north pit, an oval shape about 20 feet long, eight feet wide and three feet high, appears to have existed for some time. 2. the south pit  11. The southern-most quarry pit at issue in this matter (the south pit) is located to the east of the marsh and to the southwest of the present quarry operation; it is the southern-most of the three historical pits in its immediate area. 12. The south pit is larger than the north pit; it is shaped like a about 35  40 feet long and 5 - 15 feet wide; there is water in this pit, so is unknown, but the walls above the water surface are at most five to six There is waste slate to the south side of this pit. Three blue/white wires hole. ""Y"" and is its exact depth feet high. extend into this   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  3.  the other two quarry pits  13. Two other quarry pits once existed on the Reed land; they were located northeast of and in the immediate area of the south pit. 14. These two other quarry pits (the subsumed pits) are no longer evident, having been destroyed and subsumed by the present quarrying operation. 15. There is no evidence of any relationship (physical or otherwise) between the south pit and the two subsumed pits. C. Extraction of slate at the four quarry pits 1. 16. of 1954. 17. the south pit  Andrew Brown worked for Henry Reed, Fred Reed's father, in the summer  Henry Reed paid Brown an hourly wage for this work.  18. Brown quarried slate from the south pit, the pit closest to the marsh (Inman Pond). At the time he worked the south pit, it appeared to have been worked at some prior time by others. 19. The work performed by Andy Brown was performed utilizing crowbars, shovels, horses and a pulley system. Brown and Henry Reed also blasted the south pit with black powder. 20. The commercial slate extracted from the south pit in which Brown and Henry Reed worked was dimensional stone known as flagging. 21. About five or six, one-quarter wagon loads of slate were removed from the site by Brown and Henry Reed utilizing a wagon pulled by a horse over the dike across Inman Pond. 22. At least some of the slate Brown and Henry Reed quarried from the south pit was marketed commercially. 23. Catamount Slate's present quarrying operations do not include the south pit and are not connected to, related to, or an offshoot of, the south pit.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6  2.  the north pit and the subsumed pits  24. In 1954, Brown saw the subsumed pits; he is also aware of the north pit but has never seen it. He did not work these other three pits, however, and he is only aware of work prior to 1970 at the south pit where he worked. 25. There is no evidence of the commercial sale of slate from the north pit or the subsumed pits prior to 1970. IV. Conclusions of Law A. The slate quarry exemption law  In 1995, in order to provide certain exemptions to the slate quarrying industry, the Vermont legislature amended 10 V.S.A. 6001 and 6081. A new definition of ""slate quarry"" was added as 6001(25): (25) ""Slate quarry"" means a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products. ""Dimensional stone"" refers to slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications. The words ""slate quarry"" shall not include pits or holes from which slate is extracted primarily for purposes of crushed stone products, unless, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. New language concerning Act 250 jurisdiction over slate quarries was also added as 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l): (j) With respect to the extraction of slate from a slate quarry that is included in final slate quarry registration documents, if it were removed from a site prior to June 1, 1970, the site from which slate was actually removed, if lying unused at any time after those operations commenced, shall be deemed to be held in reserve, and shall not be deemed to be abandoned.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7  (k) (1) With respect to the commercial extraction of slate from a slate quarry, activities that are not ancillary to slate mining operations may constitute substantial changes, and be subject to permitting requirements under this chapter. ""Ancillary activities"" include the following activities that pertain to slate and that take place within a registered parcel that contains a slate quarry: drilling, crushing, grinding, sizing, washing, drying, sawing and cutting stone, blasting, trimming, punching, splitting and gauging, and use of buildings and use and construction of equipment exclusively to carry out the above activities. Buildings that existed on April 1, 1995, or any replacements to those buildings, shall be considered ancillary. (2) Activities that are ancillary activities that involve crushing, may constitute substantial changes if they may result in significant impact with respect to any of the criteria specified in subdivisions 6086(a)(1) through (10) of this title. (l ) (1) By no later than January 1, 1997, any owner of land or mineral rights or any owner of slate quarry leasehold rights on a parcel of land on which a slate quarry was located as of June 1, 1970, may register the existence of the slate quarry with the district commission and with the clerk of the municipality in which the slate quarry is located, while also providing each with a map which indicates the boundaries of the parcel which contains the slate quarry. (2) Slate quarry registration shall state the name and address of the owner of the land, mineral rights or leasehold rights; whether that person holds mineral rights, or leasehold rights or is the owner in fee simple; the physical location of the same; the physical location and size of ancillary buildings; and the book and page of the recorded deed or other instrument by which the owner holds title to the land or rights. (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8  (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. (5) With respect to a slate quarry located on a particular registered parcel of land, ancillary activities on the parcel related to the extraction and processing of slate into products that are primarily other than crushed stone products shall not be deemed to be substantial changes, as long as the activities do not involve the creation of one or more new slate quarry holes that are not related to an existing slate quarry hole. 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l). Distilled to its basics for purposes of this matter, this legislation means that: 1. Any registered slate quarry that was in existence before July 1, 1970 will never be deemed to have been abandoned. 2. Any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 is exempt from Act 250 jurisdiction. See Northeast Developers, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #342, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Oct. 28, 1997). 3. Even a substantial change to any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 will not require an Act 250 permit.2 Other language which addresses ""ancillary activities"" to slate extraction and processing is not pertinent to the issue before the Board in this case.  While the statute actually states that activities that are not ""ancillary"" to slate mining operations may be ""substantial changes,"" the inference is that activities that are ancillary to such operations  including the mining itself  are not ""substantial changes"" and therefore do not trigger jurisdiction.  2   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9  B.  Burden of proof  As the party seeking the benefit of the slate quarry exemption, Catamount Slate bears both the burdens of production and persuasion that it applies to its circumstances. United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 366 (1967); Vermont Verde Antique International, Inc., Declaratory Ruling Request #387, Dismissal Order at 4 (Feb. 2, 2001). The burden of production is the burden of going forward with evidence. See, Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272-274 (1994)(discussing burden of production and burden of persuasion); Re: Thomas Howrigan Gravel Extraction, Declaratory Ruling #358, Findings, Conclusions and Order at 9 (Aug. 30, 1999), citing Champlain Construction Co., Declaratory Ruling #214, Memorandum of Decision at 2-4 (Oct. 2, 1990)).  C.  Elements to the exemption  To obtain the statutory exemption for a pit, Catamount Slate must prove: 1. that a slate quarry (or quarries) exists on its land. The elements of the definition of a slate quarry, as set out in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25), are: a. b. c. that it is a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of  i. building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products (slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications); or ii. crushed stone products, if, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. (This part does not apply to the present case, as Catamount Slate has never argued that its pits produced crushed product.) 2. that the slate quarry existed as of June 1, 1970; 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1); and,   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  3. that the owner of the slate quarry registered such quarry with the district commission no later than January 1, 1997. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1). Since the definition of slate quarry is tied to the particular quarry pit or hole, the Board must look at each individual hole to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of the law. See, Northeast Developers, supra, at 5. It may well be that one or more of the four holes on the 122-acre tract owned by Catamount Slate qualifies for the exemption. But the Board's consideration cannot be of the entire tract; a finding that there is an exempt pit on the tract does not mean that the entire tract is therefore exempt. Rather, the exemption that the statute affords can be granted only to the particular pit that meets all of the elements of the law.  D.  Discussion  Catamount Slate has proved that, prior to 1970, slate was extracted from four separate pits on the Reed land. Catamount Slate has also proved that the extraction of the slate from one of these pits  the south pit worked by Andrew Brown in 1954, was for the purpose of the commercial production of dimensional stone products. As to the three other pits at issue in this matter, although Brown observed the subsumed pits in 1954, and other evidence indicates that the north existed prior to 1970, Catamount Slate has not provided any evidence that the extraction of slate from the subsumed pits or the north pit was for commercial purposes. Slate extracted from those pits could have been used for private, non-commercial purposes, especially given the small size of those pits. Further, Brown's testimony and other evidence offered by Catamount Slate and admitted into the record indicate that the north pit and the two subsumed pits are and were separate and distinct from the south pit. They are located some distance away from the south pit; the north pit is several hundred yards distant, and there is no evidence of any relationship between the south pit and these other pits. The Board is constrained by the language of the statute to treat each pit individually; ""slate quarry"" is defined in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25) as ""a quarry pit or hole,"" not the area or general location where a quarry pits or hole exists. Thus, the Board cannot find that, because of their proximity to the south pit, the subsumed pits (and therefore the present Catamount Slate quarrying operation) should be afforded the same exemption as the south pit enjoys. That the north pit and the subsumed pits may have been in the same general area as the exempt south pit is not relevant; that the north pit and the subsumed pits were at all times pits that were separate and distinct from the south pit is.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11  The Board therefore concludes that the south pit qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the said exemption. V. Order  1. The south pit (the southernmost of the four pre-1970 quarry pits on the Reed land and the one worked by Andrew Brown and Henry Reed in 1954) qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 2. All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 3. Because the present slate quarrying operation being conducted by Catamount Slate on the Reed land is occurring in the vicinity of the location of the two non-exempt subsumed pits, an Act 250 Land Use Permit was and is required for the said present quarrying operation. 4. Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 20th day of December 2001.

GX270-40-7773444	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151  RE:  Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products and Fred and Suellen Reed  Declaratory Ruling #389  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This proceeding involves a Petition for a Declaratory Ruling (Petition) from a Jurisdictional Opinion concerning a slate quarry operation in Fair Haven, Vermont.  I.  Procedural History  On July 21, 2000, District #1 Environmental Commission (Commission) Coordinator William Burke (Coordinator) issued Jurisdictional Opinion #1-S-50-2 (Second Reconsideration) (JO) in which he determined that commercial extraction of slate from four slate quarry holes on a  122-acre tract located off Inman Pond Road in the Town of Fair Haven (Project) requires a permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250). On August 9, 2000, Fred and Suellen Reed and Catamount Slate, Inc., (collectively, Catamount Slate) filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO. On August 29, 2000, the General Counsel for the Board issued a Notice of Prehearing Conference and Petition for Declaratory Ruling, informing those individuals who had received notice of the JO that the Petition had been filed and setting a date and time for the Prehearing Conference in this matter for September 14, 2000 at 2:00 p.m. On September 7, 2000, James Leary, Esq., the attorney for Catamount Slate at that time, informed the Board by letter that Catamount Slate and neighboring landowners, following mediation, ""appear to have reached a resolution of the issues"" underlying the Petition. Leary's letter noted that settlement documents were being drafted and stated further that he anticipated ""that Catamount Slate will withdraw its appeal after the necessary documents have been executed by the appropriate persons."" Leary therefore requested that the scheduled September 14 Prehearing Conference be continued ""pending the withdrawal of the appeal.""   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 2  On September 7, 2000, in response to Leary's letter, Board Chair Marcy Harding issued an Order, continuing the Prehearing Conference to October 13, 2000. The Chair's Order required that any further request for a continuance be filed no later than October 5, 2000. On October 3, 2000, Leary filed a second request for a continuance, noting again that the parties were continuing their attempts at a non-adversarial resolution of this matter. Leary stated that, as a part of the settlement, Catamount Slate would seek an Act 250 permit for the quarry (and associated mill facility), and once a final permit had been obtained that incorporated the relevant terms of the global settlement, Catamount Slate would withdraw the instant appeal. Leary therefore requested that the Prehearing Conference in this matter be continued pending the issuance of a final Act 250 Permit by the Commission. On October 4, 2000, in response to Leary's request, the Chair issued an Order continuing this proceeding until the Commission issued a decision concerning the Land Use Permit application which Catamount Slate stated it intended to file. The Chair's Order required that on or before January 9, 2001, Catamount Slate file with the Board a status report concerning its application. In late February 2001, with the filing of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Leary, it came to the Board's attention that attempts at an informal resolution of the issues underlying the Petition had been unsuccessful and that this Petition might therefore need to be set for further proceedings. On May 1, 2001, the Chair held a status conference in this matter and determined that this case should be set for a Prehearing Conference. On May 22, 2001, the Chair convened a Prehearing Conference. On June 29, 2001, the Board issued Memoranda of Decision on three Preliminary Issues presented in this matter. Subsequent Memoranda were issued on July 27 and September 20, 2001, following reconsideration motions filed by Catamount Slate. Hearing was held on October 3, 2001 in Fair Haven, Vermont. Catamount Slate participated through its attorney, Stephanie Lorentz, Esq. Certain neighbors to the Project also participated: Joanne and David Calvi, Lorene Sheldon, Lee Sheldon, Richard Sheldon, Joan Gagnon, Kathleen Donna, Margaret Riter and Lindsey and Priscilla Waterhouse.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  On October 17, 2001, Catamount Slate filed two post-hearing motions. The motions ask (a) for the opportunity to provide rebuttal testimony to the testimony provided at the hearing by Coordinator William Burke, and (b) that the testimony of Joseph Badgewick be struck. The Board deliberated on this matter on October 17, November 14 and December 19, 2001. This matter is now ready for final decision.  II.  The Issue  The issue to be decided is ""Whether the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit.""  III.  Findings of Fact  To the extent any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are included below, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See, Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corporation, 167 Vt. 228, 241-42 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). 1 A. The quarry tract  1. Frederick Reed and Suellen Reed own a +/-122 acre parcel of land located on the northeasterly side of ""Old Marsh Pond"" in Fair Haven, Vermont. 2. Catamount Slate, Inc. presently operates a slate quarry on the Reeds' Fair Haven land. 3. At one time, there were at least four small slate quarry pits on the Reed land; each of these four quarry pits was a separate and distinct pit, some distance from and unrelated to the others. There is present evidence of two of these quarry pits on the Reed land; the current quarrying operation has destroyed and subsumed the other two quarry pits. The Board makes its Findings of Fact based solely on evidence provided by Catamount Slate and observed at the site visit. Because the Board has not relied upon the testimony of William Burke or Joseph Badgewick, Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot. 1   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  4. Other pits, their ages unknown, exist on the Reed land; they do not appear to be natural holes. Waste slate or shale appears in or near some of these pits. B. The four quarry pits 1. the north pit  5. The northern-most quarry pit at issue in this case (the north pit) is located on the Reed land, several hundred yards to the northwest of the present quarry operation, near the east shore of Marsh Pond. 6. The north pit is approximately 25 feet long, three to six feet wide, and four to six feet deep; slate pieces lie in the bottom of the pit. 7. Some of the walls of the north pit are flat; there are drill holes on the walls.  8. Brush grows on the sides of the north pit; no trees are growing in the pit, but there is a rotted out stump on the edge of the pit. 9. The area immediately around the north pit is a mixed deciduous forest which has been logged within the last 30 years. 10. Waste slate mounds appear around the north pit; some slate pieces are large; there is no uniformity of size and the pieces are odd shapes. One waste slate mound to the west of the north pit, an oval shape about 20 feet long, eight feet wide and three feet high, appears to have existed for some time. 2. the south pit  11. The southern-most quarry pit at issue in this matter (the south pit) is located to the east of the marsh and to the southwest of the present quarry operation; it is the southern-most of the three historical pits in its immediate area. 12. The south pit is larger than the north pit; it is shaped like a about 35  40 feet long and 5 - 15 feet wide; there is water in this pit, so is unknown, but the walls above the water surface are at most five to six There is waste slate to the south side of this pit. Three blue/white wires hole. ""Y"" and is its exact depth feet high. extend into this   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  3.  the other two quarry pits  13. Two other quarry pits once existed on the Reed land; they were located northeast of and in the immediate area of the south pit. 14. These two other quarry pits (the subsumed pits) are no longer evident, having been destroyed and subsumed by the present quarrying operation. 15. There is no evidence of any relationship (physical or otherwise) between the south pit and the two subsumed pits. C. Extraction of slate at the four quarry pits 1. 16. of 1954. 17. the south pit  Andrew Brown worked for Henry Reed, Fred Reed's father, in the summer  Henry Reed paid Brown an hourly wage for this work.  18. Brown quarried slate from the south pit, the pit closest to the marsh (Inman Pond). At the time he worked the south pit, it appeared to have been worked at some prior time by others. 19. The work performed by Andy Brown was performed utilizing crowbars, shovels, horses and a pulley system. Brown and Henry Reed also blasted the south pit with black powder. 20. The commercial slate extracted from the south pit in which Brown and Henry Reed worked was dimensional stone known as flagging. 21. About five or six, one-quarter wagon loads of slate were removed from the site by Brown and Henry Reed utilizing a wagon pulled by a horse over the dike across Inman Pond. 22. At least some of the slate Brown and Henry Reed quarried from the south pit was marketed commercially. 23. Catamount Slate's present quarrying operations do not include the south pit and are not connected to, related to, or an offshoot of, the south pit.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6  2.  the north pit and the subsumed pits  24. In 1954, Brown saw the subsumed pits; he is also aware of the north pit but has never seen it. He did not work these other three pits, however, and he is only aware of work prior to 1970 at the south pit where he worked. 25. There is no evidence of the commercial sale of slate from the north pit or the subsumed pits prior to 1970. IV. Conclusions of Law A. The slate quarry exemption law  In 1995, in order to provide certain exemptions to the slate quarrying industry, the Vermont legislature amended 10 V.S.A. 6001 and 6081. A new definition of ""slate quarry"" was added as 6001(25): (25) ""Slate quarry"" means a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products. ""Dimensional stone"" refers to slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications. The words ""slate quarry"" shall not include pits or holes from which slate is extracted primarily for purposes of crushed stone products, unless, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. New language concerning Act 250 jurisdiction over slate quarries was also added as 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l): (j) With respect to the extraction of slate from a slate quarry that is included in final slate quarry registration documents, if it were removed from a site prior to June 1, 1970, the site from which slate was actually removed, if lying unused at any time after those operations commenced, shall be deemed to be held in reserve, and shall not be deemed to be abandoned.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7  (k) (1) With respect to the commercial extraction of slate from a slate quarry, activities that are not ancillary to slate mining operations may constitute substantial changes, and be subject to permitting requirements under this chapter. ""Ancillary activities"" include the following activities that pertain to slate and that take place within a registered parcel that contains a slate quarry: drilling, crushing, grinding, sizing, washing, drying, sawing and cutting stone, blasting, trimming, punching, splitting and gauging, and use of buildings and use and construction of equipment exclusively to carry out the above activities. Buildings that existed on April 1, 1995, or any replacements to those buildings, shall be considered ancillary. (2) Activities that are ancillary activities that involve crushing, may constitute substantial changes if they may result in significant impact with respect to any of the criteria specified in subdivisions 6086(a)(1) through (10) of this title. (l ) (1) By no later than January 1, 1997, any owner of land or mineral rights or any owner of slate quarry leasehold rights on a parcel of land on which a slate quarry was located as of June 1, 1970, may register the existence of the slate quarry with the district commission and with the clerk of the municipality in which the slate quarry is located, while also providing each with a map which indicates the boundaries of the parcel which contains the slate quarry. (2) Slate quarry registration shall state the name and address of the owner of the land, mineral rights or leasehold rights; whether that person holds mineral rights, or leasehold rights or is the owner in fee simple; the physical location of the same; the physical location and size of ancillary buildings; and the book and page of the recorded deed or other instrument by which the owner holds title to the land or rights. (3) Slate quarry registration documents shall be submitted to the district commission together with a request, under the provisions of subsection 6007(c) of this title, for a final determination regarding the applicability of this chapter.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8  (4) The final determination regarding a slate quarry registration under subsection 6007(c) of this title shall be recorded in the municipal land records at the expense of the registrant along with an accurate site plan of the parcel depicting the site specific information contained in the registration documents. (5) With respect to a slate quarry located on a particular registered parcel of land, ancillary activities on the parcel related to the extraction and processing of slate into products that are primarily other than crushed stone products shall not be deemed to be substantial changes, as long as the activities do not involve the creation of one or more new slate quarry holes that are not related to an existing slate quarry hole. 10 V.S.A. 6081( j), (k) and (l). Distilled to its basics for purposes of this matter, this legislation means that: 1. Any registered slate quarry that was in existence before July 1, 1970 will never be deemed to have been abandoned. 2. Any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 is exempt from Act 250 jurisdiction. See Northeast Developers, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #342, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Oct. 28, 1997). 3. Even a substantial change to any registered slate quarry in existence before July 1, 1970 will not require an Act 250 permit.2 Other language which addresses ""ancillary activities"" to slate extraction and processing is not pertinent to the issue before the Board in this case.  While the statute actually states that activities that are not ""ancillary"" to slate mining operations may be ""substantial changes,"" the inference is that activities that are ancillary to such operations  including the mining itself  are not ""substantial changes"" and therefore do not trigger jurisdiction.  2   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9  B.  Burden of proof  As the party seeking the benefit of the slate quarry exemption, Catamount Slate bears both the burdens of production and persuasion that it applies to its circumstances. United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 366 (1967); Vermont Verde Antique International, Inc., Declaratory Ruling Request #387, Dismissal Order at 4 (Feb. 2, 2001). The burden of production is the burden of going forward with evidence. See, Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272-274 (1994)(discussing burden of production and burden of persuasion); Re: Thomas Howrigan Gravel Extraction, Declaratory Ruling #358, Findings, Conclusions and Order at 9 (Aug. 30, 1999), citing Champlain Construction Co., Declaratory Ruling #214, Memorandum of Decision at 2-4 (Oct. 2, 1990)).  C.  Elements to the exemption  To obtain the statutory exemption for a pit, Catamount Slate must prove: 1. that a slate quarry (or quarries) exists on its land. The elements of the definition of a slate quarry, as set out in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25), are: a. b. c. that it is a quarry pit or hole from which slate has been extracted or removed for the purpose of commercial production of  i. building material, roofing, tile or other dimensional stone products (slate that is processed into regularly shaped blocks, according to specifications); or ii. crushed stone products, if, as of June 1, 1970, slate had been extracted from those pits or holes primarily for those purposes. (This part does not apply to the present case, as Catamount Slate has never argued that its pits produced crushed product.) 2. that the slate quarry existed as of June 1, 1970; 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1); and,   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  3. that the owner of the slate quarry registered such quarry with the district commission no later than January 1, 1997. 10 V.S.A. 6081(l)(1). Since the definition of slate quarry is tied to the particular quarry pit or hole, the Board must look at each individual hole to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of the law. See, Northeast Developers, supra, at 5. It may well be that one or more of the four holes on the 122-acre tract owned by Catamount Slate qualifies for the exemption. But the Board's consideration cannot be of the entire tract; a finding that there is an exempt pit on the tract does not mean that the entire tract is therefore exempt. Rather, the exemption that the statute affords can be granted only to the particular pit that meets all of the elements of the law.  D.  Discussion  Catamount Slate has proved that, prior to 1970, slate was extracted from four separate pits on the Reed land. Catamount Slate has also proved that the extraction of the slate from one of these pits  the south pit worked by Andrew Brown in 1954, was for the purpose of the commercial production of dimensional stone products. As to the three other pits at issue in this matter, although Brown observed the subsumed pits in 1954, and other evidence indicates that the north existed prior to 1970, Catamount Slate has not provided any evidence that the extraction of slate from the subsumed pits or the north pit was for commercial purposes. Slate extracted from those pits could have been used for private, non-commercial purposes, especially given the small size of those pits. Further, Brown's testimony and other evidence offered by Catamount Slate and admitted into the record indicate that the north pit and the two subsumed pits are and were separate and distinct from the south pit. They are located some distance away from the south pit; the north pit is several hundred yards distant, and there is no evidence of any relationship between the south pit and these other pits. The Board is constrained by the language of the statute to treat each pit individually; ""slate quarry"" is defined in 10 V.S.A. 6001(25) as ""a quarry pit or hole,"" not the area or general location where a quarry pits or hole exists. Thus, the Board cannot find that, because of their proximity to the south pit, the subsumed pits (and therefore the present Catamount Slate quarrying operation) should be afforded the same exemption as the south pit enjoys. That the north pit and the subsumed pits may have been in the same general area as the exempt south pit is not relevant; that the north pit and the subsumed pits were at all times pits that were separate and distinct from the south pit is.   Catamount Slate, Inc. d/b/a Reed Family Slate Products, and Fred and Suellen Reed Declaratory Ruling #389 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11  The Board therefore concludes that the south pit qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the said exemption. V. Order  1. The south pit (the southernmost of the four pre-1970 quarry pits on the Reed land and the one worked by Andrew Brown and Henry Reed in 1954) qualifies for the slate quarry exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 2. All of the remaining pits at issue in this Declaratory Ruling  the north pit and the subsumed pits - do not qualify for the exemption provided by 10 V.S.A. 6081(j), (k) and (l). 3. Because the present slate quarrying operation being conducted by Catamount Slate on the Reed land is occurring in the vicinity of the location of the two non-exempt subsumed pits, an Act 250 Land Use Permit was and is required for the said present quarrying operation. 4. Catamount Slate's post-hearing motions are moot.  Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 20th day of December 2001.
