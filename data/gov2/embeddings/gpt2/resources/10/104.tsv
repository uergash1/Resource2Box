GX007-18-12046464	"The National Institutes of Health  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003     Prepared April 2001            Table of Contents     National Cancer Institute     National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute     National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research     National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases     National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke     National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases     National Institute of General Medical Sciences     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development     National Eye Institute     National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences     National Institute on Aging     National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases     National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders     National Institute of Mental Health     National Institute on Drug Abuse     National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism     National Institute of Nursing Research     National Human Genome Research Institute     National Center for Research Resources     National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine     Fogarty International Center     National Library of Medicine           National Cancer Institute (NCI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)  The EDRN provides an infrastructure for supporting collaborative research on molecular, genetic, and other biomarkers of cancer.  Participating investigators make exhaustive efforts through Biomarker Developmental Laboratories, Biomarkers Validation Laboratories, and Clinical and Epidemiology Centers to ensure that a marker is ready and practical for medical application.  The long-term Goal is to discover and evaluate biomarkers and reagents that will enable the earlier detection of cancer and assessment of risk.     Within a year of initial funding, developmental researchers reported 18 promising biomarkers and related advances in multiple scientific journal articles and abstracts.  Three markers associated with a variety of cancers including bladder, head and neck, and lung, have advanced to the validation stage.  One group of scientists funded through EDRN has developed a novel approach to early detection based on identifying genetic mutations found in the DNA housed in a cell's mitochondria.  Mutations are more typically sought in a cell's nucleus, but because there is only one nucleus but many mitochondria in a cell, mitochondrial mutations are much easier to find and potentially more ideal avenues for detection.  When further developed, this approach holds promise for non-invasive screening for many types of cancer based on analysis of easily collected body fluids.    Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium (MMHCC)  This consortium of scientists was established to develop and validate mouse models with heritable malignancies that parallel human disease.  The long-term goal is to make readily available valid mouse models that will accelerate the study of cancer progression, the testing of new approaches to detection and diagnosis, and the evaluation of prevention and treatment strategies.   As a result of the Consortium's innovative and cooperative efforts to date, three mouse models are now available for public use, and nearly 60 more are complete and being readied for distribution.    The Director's Challenge: Toward a Molecular Classification of Tumors  The Director's Challenge supports investigators in developing profiles of molecular alterations to help identify clinically relevant subsets of tumors and hematopoietic cancers.  The Long-term goal is to enable precise molecular diagnoses that will allow for more targeted and effective interventions with fewer adverse side effects.   One effort funded through this initiative, the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project, is using Lymphochip cDNA microarrays to define the gene expression profiles of all types of human lymphoid malignancies.  This project supported the discovery of subtypes for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and with it, the promise of more accurate diagnosis and more targeted treatment for DLBCL.    Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) Program  Through the RAID program, NCI staff work to identify promising new therapies, assist investigators in the final stages of drug development, and assess whether the selected treatment is an appropriate candidate for clinical trials.  The long-term goal is to hasten the speed at which new cancer treatments come into use.   About 50 new drugs and biological therapeutic agents (e.g., vaccines and targeted gene therapies) have been identified for assessment through the RAID program, and more than 10 of these will reached or be ready for clinical trials by the end of 2001.    Quick Trials for Novel Cancer Therapies  The Quick Trials Program accelerates the testing of promising new therapies in pilot, phase I, and phase II clinical trials by providing scientists with a streamlined application and review process that enables awards to be issued within five months of receipt.  The long-term goal is to expedite the development of new cancer therapies.   Since January 2000, when the program completed an initial trial and was expanded to include all forms of cancer, NCI has made 15 awards for early clinical trials or associated laboratory testing of new therapies.      Future Initiatives       Molecular Targets Laboratories (MTLs) Initiative  These laboratories will accelerate discovery, development, and testing of ""molecular target agents"" to be used for cancer treatment and prevention.  These agents work by reversing or blocking certain molecular defects in cells that cause them to become malignant or by specifically inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.  The MTLs will emphasize collaboration among chemists and biologists to identify potential anti-cancer compounds and develop high throughput computerized screening assays for confirming the ability of the compounds to alter the targeted tumor-causing molecular aberration.  The long-term goal will be to develop better prevention and treatment modalities that target cancer at the molecular level.    Clinical Trials Expansion   As part of NCI's continuing efforts to promote participation in clinical trials, the Institute will be offering physicians and their patients more opportunities to be involved in the large-scale clinical trials.  NCI will reach out to ""non-Group"" physicians and their patients by expanding access to NCI's Cooperative Groups, networks of health care professionals affiliated with medical schools, teaching hospitals, and community-based cancer treatment centers.  A simple, computer-based system will assist these physicians with easy enrollment of patients.  The long-term goal is to increase access to and participation in clinical trials.    Centers for Population Health  To increase understanding of cancer-related health disparities, NCI will create four Centers for Population Health beginning in 2002.  These centers will carry out research to: (1) expand our understanding of the social and environmental causes of cancer-related health disparities and the psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors that mediate them, (2) develop hypotheses for cancer control research at individual, social, institutional, and policy levels, and (3) develop, apply, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based interventions for reducing cancer-related health disparities.  The long-term goal of the Centers will be to inform policy and care decisions that affect cancer outcomes and reduce cancer care and outcome disparities.    Additional In vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Centers (ICMICs)  These centers foster closer ties between the basic scientists who discover new cancer genes and the pathways by which cancer develops, the imaging scientists who can apply that information in non-invasive studies of cancer progression, and the physicians that treat cancer patients.  In fiscal year 2002, the NCI plans to further its support for this approach to imaging research by expanding the number of centers from three to five.  If funding is available, the Institute expects to continue to expand the program in subsequent years.  The long-term goal is to accelerate the development and implementation of functional imaging technology for use in more precise and non-invasive diagnosis and treatment of cancer as well as to evaluate treatment outcomes.    Expansion of the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) Program  Through the RAID program, NCI staff identify promising new therapies, assist investigators in the final stages of drug development, and assess the appropriateness of selected treatments for clinical trials.  With roughly 50 new drugs and biological therapeutic agents (e.g., vaccines and targeted gene therapies) already under development, the RAID program is projected to reach capacity in the first half of Fiscal Year 2001.  Increased funds in Fiscal Year 2002 will allow NCI to accept additional agents into the RAID program, without waiting for therapies currently under development to make their way through the pipeline.  The long-term goal is to hasten the speed at which new cancer treatments come into use.        National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Programs for Genomic Applications (PGAs)  The PGAs, which will apply and expand on data and technologies developed to map and sequence the human genome, are the largest, most ambitious, basic science program the NHLBI has ever funded.  The immediate purpose of the PGAs is to clearly identify the subsets of genes linked to heart, lung, blood, and sleep function.  The long-term goal is to use knowledge generated by the PGA program to develop better methods for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy in heart, lung, blood, and sleep function.  Launched in October 2000, the program currently includes 37 PGAs.    Programs of Excellence in Gene Therapy (PEGTs)  The PEGTs will focus on rapid translation of findings from basic research in heart, lung, and blood diseases into pilot studies in human volunteers, with appropriate attention to safeguarding the welfare of the patients.   To accomplish this goal, the PEGTs will provide shared access to specialized services such as preclinical toxicology testing, developing ""vectors"" to ferry therapeutic genes to their target tissues, producing large amounts of biological reagents, providing biostatistical support, and establishing a high-quality training program for M.D., M.D./Ph.D., and Ph.D. scientists.  The long-term goal of this coordinated approach is to help make the promise of gene therapy a reality.  Five PEGTs were awarded in September 2000.    Pediatric Heart Disease Clinical Research Network  The Pediatric Heart Disease Clinical Research Network will support an interactive group of centers that will accelerate research in the diagnosis and management of pediatric heart disease; standardize existing treatments; and evaluate new therapies.  A primary goal is rapid dissemination of the findings from Network clinical studies to the medical community.   Thirty-four applications have been received and are scheduled for initial review in early April.  They will then go to the June National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council for funding consideration.  It is anticipated that six or seven clinical centers and one coordinating center will be awarded in midsummer of 2001.    Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)  MESA is a major NHLBI study that will seek new ways to detect heart disease in its early stages, before symptoms appear.  MESA could also yield more specific predictors of heart disease and determine which factors best predict heart disease in men and women, and in white, African American, Hispanic, and Asian populations.  MESA will collect information on heart disease risk factors, as well as other sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors.  It will also examine a variety of newly emerging factors, such as calcium deposits in the coronary artery.  Six field centers, three image analysis centers, a central laboratory, and a coordinating center were funded in Fall 2000.    Sequencing the Rat Genome  The laboratory rat, whose genome is similar in size to the human genome, is widely used as a disease model in research directed at understanding, treating, and preventing many human diseases.  Knowledge of the rat genome, therefore, will give important hints for understanding human biology and new impetus to genomic-based research on human disease.   In February 2001, the NHLBI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) awarded a major initiative to determine the DNA sequence of the genome of the laboratory rat.      Future Initiatives       Innovative Concepts and Approaches to Developing Functional Tissues and Organs for Heart, Vascular, Lung, and Blood Applications — Exploratory/Developmental Awards  This initiative will support research to develop functional tissues and organs, and suitable substitutes such as artificial blood components or heart valves.  It originated at the recommendation of a working group convened to identify extraordinary research opportunities that should be supported if the Institute received a significant funding increase.  Estimates of the total U.S. health care costs for patients with tissue loss or end-stage organ failure exceed $400 billion annually.  Moreover, because of the dearth of transplantable organs, many of these people die.  For example, the American Heart Association reports that, in 1997, only 2,300 of the 40,000 Americans who needed a new heart received one.    Minority Medical School Research Program  The NHLBI's Minority Medical School Research Program will help minority medical schools develop the infrastructure and resources required to conduct state-of-the-art research and to recruit and train future scientists.  Given the disproportionate burden of disease among racial and ethnic minorities and the unique sociocultural issues involved in disease pathogenesis and management among these groups, it is critical that more minority individuals be brought into the biomedical research workforce.     Novel Biomarkers of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  This program will support research to identify and characterize COPD biomarkers, i.e., biochemicals that change during the development and progression of COPD.  Understanding them will allow clinicians to make earlier diagnoses and more accurate prognoses and ultimately should lead to customized treatments for individual patients.  COPD, which is the fourth leading cause of death in this country, affects 15 million Americans and will likely continue to be a major cause of disability and premature death for many years to come.    Role of Infectious Agents in Vascular Diseases  This initiative will support research to delineate mechanisms by which infectious agents contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD) and other vascular diseases.  CHD is the second leading cause of death in the United States and costs Americans $55 billion each year in health care expenditures.  Established risk factors such as high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension do not fully explain the etiology or incidence of this condition, and evidence implicating infectious agents is increasing.  Understanding the link between infectious agents and vascular disease is an essential step for the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment.    Trials Assessing Innovative Strategies to Improve Clinical Practice through Guidelines in Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases  This initiative will support research to elucidate why many physicians do not apply research results to clinical practices, even when results are incorporated into clinical recommendations and guidelines designed to help them treat their patients.  Researchers also will develop strategies to improve clinical guideline adherence.   Because many clinicians do not incorporate evidence-based guidelines when developing treatment strategies for their patients, some people do not benefit from research advances.  This lack of communication between the clinical researchers and the practicing clinicians may cause patients to suffer needless morbidity and mortality.  For example, providing state-of-the-art treatment to all patients experiencing acute myocardial infarctions could help to prevent an estimated 18,000 deaths per year.  Until the barriers for educating physicians about the most effective treatments are identified and methods for overcoming them are developed, it is unlikely that the nation will maximize its return on its investment in medical research.         National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research  (NIDCR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Applying Biomimetics to Repairing and Restoring Oral and Facial Tissues  With more Americans living longer lives, there is an increasing need to repair and restore damaged bone and tissue.  Inherited disorders, infectious and neoplastic diseases, oral injuries, and many other chronic and disabling diseases can all result in damage to craniofacial bones and tissues.  The new discipline of biomimetics takes cues from nature to develop new approaches to repair and replace body tissues.  In the past three years NIDCR has used a portion of its increased funding to take advantage of the opportunities created by this emerging interdisciplinary field, with the long term goal of developing new techniques and methods of restoring orofacial bone and tissue.   NIDCR is supporting a series of new biomimetic projects.  For example, NIDCR has funded research with the long term goal of engineering fully functional skeletal muscle tissues to be used in craniofacial reconstructive surgery.  On the reconstruction of hard tissues —  including those of the temporomandibular joint — the Institute is supporting research on biocomputing techniques to design and manufacture  implants with specific architecture and shape to promote the growth of  new bone-forming cells. An additional series of new projects is directed at repair and replacement of dental tissue.  For example, scientists are focusing on the interface formed between two dissimilar tooth structures (enamel and dentin) to eventually biomimetically recreate this interface in tooth restorative materials. Although we expect the major impact of this body of research will take years to develop, some of these projects have already yielded results.  For example, one group of NIDCR-funded scientists have identified a key genetic protein that results in defective mineralization of teeth in mice.  If this protein proves to have a similar role in humans, this discovery could lead to new strategies to re-mineralize damaged teeth.      Using Microbial Genomics to Develop New Insights on Common Dental Diseases  The two most prevalent dental diseases, caries and periodontal diseases, are the major causes of tooth loss.  Once thought to be natural consequences of aging, caries and periodontal diseases are now recognized to be infections caused by bacteria in the biofilm that forms on teeth and other oral surfaces.  A variety of organisms have been implicated in causing these diseases, making it more difficult to determine why some individuals are more susceptible and others more resistant.  NIDCR has funded a series of efforts to sequence and analyze the genomes of several major organisms commonly found in the oral cavity.  The long-term goal of this research is to promote understanding of the roles these different organisms play in the development and progression of caries and periodontal diseases, leading to more effective prevention and treatment.   NIDCR has funded a series of projects in microbial genomics designed to sequence the genomes of six major organisms.  These organisms are all associated with caries and periodontal diseases, and several have also been implicated in other infections throughout the body.  Furthermore, several of these pathogens are closely related to organisms that cause other infectious diseases such as pneumonia.  These projects will enhance our capability to prevent and manage caries and periodontal diseases.    Reducing Oral Health Disparities  As we move into the 21st century, NIDCR can look back to over 50 years of progress in understanding, treating, and preventing the complex diseases that affect the mouth and face.  However, not all Americans have shared equally in the benefits of these important scientific breakthroughs.  Disparities in oral health continue to exist at all ages and among the different population groups that comprise our society. For example, African American men are one-third more likely to be diagnosed with oral cancer than whites, and their 5-year survival rate is only 28 percent, compared to a 53 percent survival rate for white men.  Women are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome, and more frequently suffer from temporomandibular disorders.  NIDCR's long term goal is to eliminate health disparities by improving health outcomes for disadvantaged populations through biomedical research.     NIDCR has sponsored additional work on health disparities across several scientific areas.  For example, in fiscal year 2001 NIDCR will be establishing the Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Disparities in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as numerous NIH institutes and offices.  We are also expanding efforts to communicate research findings appropriately to populations at highest risk and to health professionals, and have embarked upon planning grants for state-wide models aimed at preventing oral cancer.       Future Initiatives       Construction of an Artificial Salivary Gland  NIDCR will also use the new technology of tissue engineering to focus on development of a ""first of its kind"" artificial salivary gland.  Saliva is a remarkable, multipurpose fluid whose presence most of us take for granted. Yet it is estimated that over one million people suffer a loss of salivary gland function as a result of Sjgren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) or from radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. The resulting loss of saliva flow markedly impairs quality of life. Without adequate saliva, patients may experience difficulty speaking, chewing and swallowing. They may also experience rampant tooth decay, infections, loss of taste, and considerable discomfort. No effective treatments currently exist to help these patients.  NIDCR scientists are focused on creating a small tube that can be placed into the cheek of patients whose salivary gland cells have been destroyed. The tube would be lined with cells engineered to secrete a saliva-like substance. Scientists believe that this artificial salivary gland will be ready for clinical testing within 5-7 years.    Novel Genes Involved in Craniofacial Disorders  Through a new initiative, NIDCR is identifying and cataloguing the genes involved in specific stages of craniofacial development to find those responsible for craniofacial disorders and birth defects. Recently, 20,000 different markers from genes active in early embryos were identified. The next goal will be to identify the subset of genes that are expressed uniquely in the developing craniofacial tissues. Information available from the Human Genome Project also is helping to determine the location of expressed genes on human chromosomes. If the expressed genes map to sites close to known human genetic disorders, then they will be tested as a possible cause of that disease.    Centers for Research Excellence on Head and Neck Cancer  In fiscal year 2002, NIDCR and NCI will introduce a new initiative to co-fund Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) on head and neck cancers. These specialized programs are designed to support translational research that will have the most immediate impact on reducing the incidence, morbidity and mortality of organ-site cancers. Basic and clinical researchers will work together to search for new approaches to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancers. These programs are not only expected to conduct a wide spectrum of research, but also to contribute to the development of research model systems and the expansion of the research base through collaborations with laboratory scientists and clinicians nationwide.        National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  (NIDDK)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Development of Cell Replacement Therapy for Diabetes  NIDDK aims to exploit emerging knowledge of the insulin-producing beta cell to develop innovative targets for treatment/prevention, including beta cell replacement/regeneration techniques to cure type 1 diabetes; strategies for preservation/replenishment of beta cell function to halt or delay disease progression; and methods to combat diminished insulin secretion/action and beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes.   NIDDK has:  (1) Capitalized on recent successes in islet transplant research through RFA on Human Islet Transplantation into Humans and establishment of intramural Transplant and Autoimmunity Branch; (2) Established Beta Cell Biology Consortium to [a] address islet supply shortage by developing new sources of islets from adult stem cells, [b] understand beta cell growth and development to facilitate efforts at beta cell regeneration, and [c] understand basis for islet cell failure in type 2 diabetes. (3) Launched initiative on functional genomics of the endocrine pancreas, and created consortium database, with Website; (4) Expanded initiative to disseminate microarray technology by creation of biotechnology centers and grant supplements; (6) Issued RFAs on adult stem cells and developmental aspects of the endocrine pancreas and on beta cell surface markers; (7) Advance: Identified genes for transcription factors crucial for islet and beta cell development.    Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Nehropathy  Activities in this initiative focus on finding genes in polygenic diseases that confer susceptibility in terms of beta cell failure and insulin resistance, as well as genes that, independent of diabetes risk, confer susceptibility to irreversible kidney failure in diabetes patients.   NIDDK has:  (1) Created and expanded the International Type 2 Genetics Linkage Consortium; (2) Joined CIDR; (3) Added minorities to initial populations being studied in type 2 genetics consortium and launched new initiative:  FIND - Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes for genetic analysis of patient populations of different ethnic backgrounds; (4) Advances: [a] Identified SNPs of candidate genes; [b] Cloned MODY genes, many of which are transcription factors involved in beta cell development efforts described above; [c] Cloned NIDDM 1 gene, providing new targets for therapy/prevention.    Development of More Effective Treatments for Hepatitis C, with Emphasis on Minority Populations with Poor Response to Antiviral Drugs  NIDDK's goal is to combat hepatitis C, which is a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver failure, by understanding and redressing the reasons that a large proportion of patients, especially African Americans, do not respond to advances in therapy (interferon and ribavirin).   NIDDK has:  (1) Organized centers and launched major clinical trials — HALT-C trial and ancillary studies, plus new trial Chronic Hepatitis C in African Americans: Study of Resistance to Antiviral Therapy; (2) Spearheaded NIH-wide RFA on Hepatitis C: Natural History, Pathogenesis, Therapy and Prevention; (3) Co-sponsored RFA with NCCAM on Milk Thistle in Treatment of Hepatic Diseases; (5) Developed plans for health awareness campaign for minority populations.    Reducing ESRD through Understanding the Causes of and Developing Treatments for Inherited Kidney Diseases, with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) as a Model  This initiative's goal is to reduce the enormous personal and societal costs of end stage renal disease by halting/delaying the progression of PKD and other major ""precursor"" kidney diseases toward irreversible kidney failure and attendant dialysis/transplantation.   NIDDK has:  (1) Created 4 centers to capitalize on discovery of genes for PKD1 and PKD2, and to exploit mouse models and test innovative treatments; (2) Advance: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor cured PKD in mouse model; (3) Using developments in technology and mouse studies, launched consortium to test non-invasive  assessment of cyst enlargement as useful means of monitoring effectiveness of treatment strategies to be tested in future intervention trial planned for FY 2002 and for possible extension to other inherited kidney diseases; (4) Developed prospectus for FY 2002 planned intervention trial of converting enzyme inhibitors for slowing PKD progression; (5) Planned new National Kidney Disease Education Program.    Epidemiology and Treatment of Benign Urologic Diseases  NIDDK supports research to reduce the burden of painful inflammation, infections and obstructions of the genitourinary tract.   NIDDK has:  (1) Launched ""Urology in America Data Base"" to understand the natural history and progression of these diseases; (2) Established Urinary Incontinence Network for clinical research, and urinary incontinence awareness campaign; (3) Established Chronic Prostatitis Consortium, with enhanced minority recruitment; (4) Strengthened BPH portfolio, including initiative on plant-derived complementary therapies with NCCAM; (5) Issued RFA on Innovative Research Approaches to Basic Bladder Biology and the Painful Bladder Syndrome, which has significant relevance to interstitial cystitis; (6) Advance: New insights into virulence factors with respect to E. coli that increase the likelihood of bladder invasion by thread-like appendages on the surface of bacteria called pili — leading to UTIs. This advance may speed development of a vaccine to prevent UTIs in those at risk.      Future Initiatives       Type 1 Diabetes Trial Net  NIDDK will attain full-scale operation of this clinical trial network (clinical centers and coordinating center) to test innovative interventions to preserve pancreatic beta cell function and prevent type 1 diabetes.    Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents, with Emphasis on Minority Populations  NIDDK plans to develop and test effective prevention strategies and treatment regimens to combat the alarming increases of type 2 diabetes in young age groups through solicitation of investigator-initiated clinical trial proposals and a coordinating center.  Emphasis  will be on studies of community or school-based prevention programs that can be applied in a cost-effective manner to decrease risk factors and lower disease incidence and on treatment trials that may include lifestyle changes and/or medical therapy.    Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project  NIDDK will undertake gene profiling, not only of pancreatic tissue, but of all tissue relevant to diabetes, including fat, muscle, and kidney, to gain insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.    Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Environmental Approaches to Its Prevention  NIDDK will undertake clinical study of gastric bypass surgery; initiate clinical trials in high-risk special populations; and enhance research on environmental approaches to prevention of obesity through accumulation of preliminary data needed for design of large-scale prevention trials.    Barrett's Esophagus and Adenocarcinoma  NIDDK plans to mount a major collaborative effort with NCI to define prevalence, natural history, pathogenesis and means of prevention and therapy based on workshops held in FY 2001.    Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium and Clinical Research Network  NIDDK will establish an IBD Genetics Consortium based on results of FY 2001 workshop to review genetics studies; to identify specific risk alleles; and to understand gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, as well as population-specific differences.  Initiate clinical research network to facilitate timely and efficient testing of emerging drug therapies for IBD.    Clinical Research Network for Study of Fatty Liver Disease, NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis) To Prevent Progression to Cirrhosis and End-Stage Liver Disease  NIDDK will frame an interlocking set of cooperative agreements for 4-6 clinical centers and a data coordinating center for the design and implementation of a database and clinical research network to study the etiology, natural history, course, complications, contributing factors and therapy of this disease.  NASH typically occurs in middle-aged persons who are overweight and diabetic and for which there is currently no specific therapy.    Database on Living Donor Liver Transplantation  NIDDK will establish a database of 4 to 6 participating centers to elucidate the ethical, technical, medical and basic research issues surrounding this surgery, based on recommendations of an NIH workshop.  Although this surgery is difficult and potentially fatal, it is an important area for study because it represents a surgical alternative that avoids the lengthening waiting period for cadaveric transplant, may decrease the mortality rate on that waiting list, and change liver transplantation from an emergency into a scheduled procedure.    Prospective Cohort Study of Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRIC)  NIDDK will establish a multicenter prospective study of factors associated with rapid decline in renal function and identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  Also establish central repository for biological specimens, including genetic material.    Expansion of Outreach and Public Education Efforts  NIDDK plans to expand existing National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) to include a new initiative aimed at health care providers.  NIDDK will also launch a new National Kidney Disease Education Program, based on plans developed with the kidney community in FY 2001.        National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  (NINDS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Centers of Excellence  Beginning in FY 1999 NINDS has funded a network of eleven Parkinson's disease research centers at universities and medical centers throughout the country.  The Udall centers provide the collaborative environment necessary to take full advantage of emerging discoveries in the basic and technological sciences that are the prelude to advances in treating, preventing, and curing Parkinson's disease.  Center activities range from basic studies of how genes and environment influence this disorder, to developing drugs, gene therapy, and surgical treatments.  The Centers will help find better ways to treat, and finally prevent or cure Parkinson's disease.    Specialized Neuroscience Research Programs at Minority Institutions  Since FY 1999 NINDS, working together with NCRR, the ORMH and other Institutes, has expanded its original center at Morehouse School of Medicine  to eight specialized neuroscience research centers at minority institutions and a network of research consortia at 28 leading neuroscience research programs.  The program is geographically diverse, including  centers in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. NINDS is planning further expansion of SNRP activities with a parallel development of other research units focusing on health disparities as an integral part of the Institute plan for addressing heath disparities.  Our goal is to prepare future neuroscience and health professionals who can assist NIH in reducing the disease disparity of populations that are historically at increased risk for diseases and disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system.    Implementation of the Parkinson's Research Agenda  In FY 2001 NIH began aggressively implementing a five year  plan for Parkinson's disease research, from basic science to clinical priorities such as drug, surgical, and cell transplantation therapies.  Actions so far, or planned for the near term, include expedited grant supplements, several workshops, grant and contract solicitations, and efforts to recruit new investigators, encourage resource sharing among researchers, create a patient registry and provide an extensive web site.  Costs will increase further as progress moves into large phase III clinical trials.  The long-term goal is to find ways to treat, prevent and cure Parkinson's disease and related disorders    NINDS Infrastructure Supplement Program  Neuroscience has always been highly dependent on technology.  In FY 1999 NINDS offered grantees the opportunity to submit one page applications, with rapid review,  for supplements to purchase small equipment essential for everyday experiments to replace outmoded, and often inadequate, items. The response was overwhelming, with more than 1400 applications, indicating a critical unmet need in the neuroscience research community. NINDS has continued the Infrastructure support program in subsequent years.  The program has the added advantage of providing essential support without a multi-year budget commitment.  The program's goal is to improve the efficiency of research in all areas of the NINDS mission.    Developing Tests for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)  Response to the public health and economic threats presented by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (""mad cow disease"") are severely hampered by the lack of adequate tests.  NINDS has long been a leader in this formerly obscure area of neuroscience.  The Institute has directed that expertise, through a major contract program funded in FY 2000, to developing the needed tests.  NINDS' goal is to address the critical need for early and sensitive detection of TSEs    Emergency Stroke Program  Now that NINDS sponsored trials have demonstrated that improvements in emergency treatment of stroke can improve outcome, it is crucial to build on those findings and develop better emergency treatments. The NIH intramural environment provides unique opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations, but lacked the necessary emergency facilities.  Beginning in FY 1999, the Institute recruited leading clinical stroke researchers and created an emergency stroke treatment research program in cooperation with local Suburban Hospital with the aim of improving diagnosis and emergency treatment of stroke.  Our goal in implementing the program is to  improve emergency care of stroke, thereby reducing death and disability.      Future Initiatives       Acute Stroke Centers  In 1995 NINDS demonstrated the first effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke, but the drug TPA is only partly effective and can not be used in all strokes.  The NINDS sponsors many laboratory research projects that demonstrate the potential of other drugs for stroke, but translating those findings to practical treatments has been hampered by the slow emergence of state-of-the-art acute stroke centers, in part due to financial constraints of the healthcare marketplace. NINDS is therefore planning to support a network of acute stroke centers across the U.S., each capable of  treating  patients rapidly and serving as a clinical laboratory for scientific projects carrying out investigations related to acute stroke.  The network should reduce the incidence of death and disability from stroke.    Neuroprotection Trial for Parkinson's Disease  NINDS is developing  a program of clinical trials focusing on drugs that, unlike current options, actually slow the course of Parkinson's disease.  The design will efficiently evaluate several compounds during a single trial and involve a large number of patients at more than 40 clinical centers.  NINDS will seek suggestions broadly for possible drugs to test, from NIH investigators, the Parkinson's research community, Parkinson's patients and advocates, and pharmaceutical companies.  Our goal is to find drugs that slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's disease.    Bioengineering Research Partnerships  NINDS enthusiastically participated in the trans-NIH Bioengineering Research Partnership, in 1999 and 2000. The Institute  has a longstanding program in neural prosthesis development that relates to the initiative, but applications received spanned other emerging areas of opportunity including brain imaging, predicting and preventing epileptic seizures and automated MR imaging in multiple sclerosis.  In view of the number of high quality applications received, NINDS proposes to expand its participation in this initiative in FY 2002.  Through participation, we hope to harness bioengineering for reducing the burden of neurological disorders.    Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke  Despite many studies, the reasons for the geographical and racial disparities in stroke are poorly understood.  The well documented disparities between the ""stroke belt"" and other areas of the U.S. cannot be explained by known risk factors and racial characteristics.   NINDS proposes to fund a large-scale study, using an innovative combination of home visits and clinical measurements, that is expected to answer questions about stroke disparities that have plagues scientists, clinicians, and policy makers.  Our goal is to eliminate the geographic and racial disparities in stroke.    Achieving Benchmarks for Progress Against Epilepsy  In March 2000 NINDS organized a landmark conference focused on finding ways to cure or prevent epilepsy.  Building on the momentum of the conference an extensive planning effort by leading epilepsy experts and NIH staff produced a series of detailed benchmarks needed to accomplish the long term goals.  Achieving those benchmarks will require extensive new programs in many areas of basic and clinical science, as well as technology.  We aim to improve treatment and move toward curing and preventing epilepsy.    Developing Drugs for Neurological Disorders  Increasing understanding about the molecular basis of neurological disorders presents new targets for developing drug treatments.  However, industry is not focusing on most of these disorders.  NINDS is therefore developing programs to remove technological barriers and encourage academic investigators by providing access to high throughput drug screening technology, support for the development of rapid assays (tests) of potential new drugs, and logistic and financial help to screen compounds already approved by the FDA for other uses.  We hope to develop better drugs for neurological disorders.    Implementation of Brain Tumor Progress Review Group Recommendations  The most common types of brain tumors are often rapidly fatal, and effective treatment is not available.  The Brain Tumor Genome Anatomy Project (BTGAP), well underway in cooperation with NCI, has demonstrated the prospects for applying new approaches to understanding brain tumors. In 2000 - 2001 NINDS and NCI convened more than 100 experts in all aspects of brain tumor biology and treatment to assess the state of the science in 14 critical areas relevant to brain tumor research and to provide detailed recommendations for  stimulating  progress.   Full implementation will require engaging disciplines from basic molecular, cancer and neurosciences, through epidemiology, pharmacology, radiation biology, and imaging.  Our goal is to improve treatment for brain tumors.        National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  (NIAID)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN)  The ITN was established with an October 1999 award that involves nearly 40 institutions.  The ITN develops new ways of inducing immune tolerance, i.e., inducing the ability to selectively adjust the immune system so that it inhibits harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact.  The strategy has promise for improving the success of transplants and treatments for autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.  Currently underway are studies on kidney transplantation and islet cell transplantation (for treatment of type-1 diabetes).  In FY 2001, additional funds will be awarded to the ITN to expand its scope to include application of immune tolerance to prevention and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases.    The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN)  The HVTN and the HPTN strengthen and expand capacity for HIV vaccine and other prevention research.  Both networks enable clinical trials to be conducted in a global context so that the studies  are carried out domestically as well as in the countries devastated by the AIDS pandemic.  The HVTN has a comprehensive clinical research agenda.  Formerly, early-stage HIV vaccine testing was carried out separately from the network that conducted later testing.   The HPTN has a special focus on non-vaccine HIV/AIDS prevention research.  Previously, that research was subsumed in the same network that tested HIV/AIDS vaccines.  This work is central to international efforts to contain the AIDS pandemic.   In July 2000, awards were made to establish HVTN and HPTN clinical trial sites.  In FY 2001, funds will be awarded to initiate preparations for clinical trials, such as: the first Federal Phase III (efficacy) trial of an HIV vaccine candidate (HVTN); and safety and efficacy trials of several novel topical microbicides and methods to block transmission of HIV from mother to child during the birthing process.    The Vaccine Research Center (VRC)  The VRC enables a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to vaccine design and development.  Although the primary current focus of the VRC is an AIDS vaccine, the long-term mission is broader — to facilitate development of effective vaccines for human disease.  The VRC began operation as a ""laboratory without walls.""  In the summer of  2000, the Center moved into its newly completed research building.  The Center has assembled a team of world class scientists in structural biology, virology, and immunology.  The VRC also has created core laboratories in immunology, flow cytometry, vector development, a biocontainment laboratory, an animal facility, a vaccine production program, and a clinical trials program.  Research laboratories within the VRC are in the process of generating multiple vaccine candidates.    Expansion of the Malaria Vaccine Development Unit (MVDU)  A licensed vaccine against malaria, one of the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide, has been a goal of the infectious disease research community for decades.  NIAID's intramural MVDU identifies candidate vaccines, develop vaccine production processes, and test vaccine candidates in the U.S. and malaria endemic areas overseas.   The MVDU moved into newly renovated space in the Twinbrook II building in Rockville in January 2001.  The MVDU had been in temporary quarters since its establishment within the Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases.  The renovated space provides new capacity for production of recombinant proteins for use in candidate vaccines, production of clinical grade proteins, and testing of vaccine candidates in animal models.      Future Initiatives       Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center  The proposed Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center would capitalize on the information contained in recently deciphered pathogen gene sequences.  By providing the research community with a wide range of resources and technologies the Center would enable efficient determination of the function and expression of sequenced microbial genes.   The potential insights could revolutionize research on infectious disease processes and be critical to the development of new vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics.    International Centers of Excellence in Research (ICER)  Through partnerships with developing counties, the ICER program would promote the development of a sustained research program in areas with high infectious disease burdens.  Uniquely drawing the resources and skills of an intramural and an extramural division of NIAID, the ICER program would enable U.S. scientists and their counterparts in developing nations to jointly develop a scientific agenda that addresses endemic infectious diseases and would foster infrastructure development and training so that a platform for ongoing research collaboration is formed.    When to Start and When/How to Change Antiretroviral Therapy  Potent combinations of anti-HIV drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy or ""HAART"") have reduced the number of AIDS deaths and new AIDS cases in many western countries; however, the utility of these medications is limited by cost, toxicities, complicated and disruptive dosing regimens, and development of drug resistance.  NIAID proposes initiatives on research into when to start antiretroviral therapy and into when/how to change antiretroviral therapy in order to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness of different approaches to therapeutic intervention.  Large, randomized clinical trials in adults, with primary endpoints of long-term morbidity, mortality and quality of life would be used to maximize the benefit and minimize the limitations of antiretroviral therapy.    Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Novel Approaches to Pathogen Detection  Over the past several years, scientists have demonstrated that infectious agents can cause diseases such as Lyme arthritis, cervical cancer, and liver cancer.  Mounting evidence indicates that infectious agents also may cause and/or contribute to coronary artery disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.  NIAID seeks to identify and understand the role of infectious agents in the cause and progression of chronic diseases, with the ultimate aim of developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.    Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA)  NIAID hopes to launch the CIPRA to provide long-term support for clinical and laboratory studies to identify and develop practical, affordable, and acceptable methods to prevent and treat  HIV/AIDS in adults and children in developing countries.  Among other goals, this program would enhance the capacity of host countries to participate in large-scale trials sponsored by the HIV Vaccine Trial Network.    Sex and Gender Differences in Immune Response  This initiative would support multidisciplinary research to identify, characterize, and define sex and gender-based differences in immune responses.  Such difference may be important in autoimmune diseases (including multiple sclerosis, Sjgren's syndrome, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), and other immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, and infectious diseases.  Knowledge of differences in the immune response should allow the development of gender targeted therapies or preventive strategies to improve the health of both men and women.    Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program in Topical Microbicides  NIAID has a strong commitment to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.  A component of NIAID's research program is focused on microbicides, substances designed to prevent sexual transmission of microorganisms. The Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program in Topical Microbicides would stimulate and support the discovery and development of novel microbicides and combination strategies, and will provide support for translational studies to move new approaches into early clinical trials.        National Institute of General Medical Sciences  (NIGMS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Structural Genomics  The NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative is designed to organize a large-scale, cooperative effort in the field of structural genomics, which involves predicting the three-dimensional shapes of proteins from gene sequences using biophysics techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy.  Knowing the shapes of proteins will enable researchers to better understand how proteins function normally and how faulty protein structures can cause disease.  In September 2000, the Institute awarded $29.7 million to fund the first year of seven pilot research center projects, each of which will be funded for 5 years.  The long-term goal for the effort is to develop a public database of protein structures — in 10 years, NIGMS hopes to have 10,000 structures in this repository, which will be freely available to the scientific community.  Currently, each of the centers is buying equipment, hiring staff, and transforming itself from a collection of many individual research laboratories into a unified research center.    ""Glue"" Grants  NIGMS created an initiative to ""glue"" together large groups of scientists pursuing some of the biggest unsolved problems in biomedicine today.  In September 2000, NIGMS made the first ""glue"" grant award of $7.3 million for the first of 5 years to a consortium of basic scientists called the Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AFCS).  A key long-term goal of this initiative is to create a ""virtual cell,"" in which scientists will be able to create ""wiring diagrams"" for healthy cells.  This is expected to greatly enhance the drug development process.  To date, the AFCS has compiled a list of more than 2,400 proteins involved in cellular signaling.  The AFCS expects to begin to share its first experimental results with the scientific community within the next few months.    Pharmacogenetics  Pharmacogenetics is the science of how a person's genes influence how he or she responds to medicines.  NIGMS is leading a trans-NIH effort called the Pharmacogenetics Research Network and Knowledge Base, an interactive network of pharmacogenetics investigators who store data in a shared information library that is freely accessible to the scientific community.  The first nine pharmacogenetics research network awards — totaling $12.8 million for the first year of funding, $8.5 million of it from NIGMS — were made in April 2000.  Grantees are already collecting data.  An important long-term goal of the effort will be to expand and maintain the PharmGKB information library.    Integrative Studies of Complex Systems  NIGMS has created a set of initiatives to promote quantitative, interdisciplinary approaches to solving biomedical research problems.  These approaches are often necessary to begin to understand the complex, interactive behavior of many components, such as how cells communicate and how organs ""talk"" to each other.  The long-term goals of such integrative studies include understanding all of the genetic and environmental components that work together to regulate processes and conditions such as the development of embryos, inflammation, complex disorders like heart disease, and many others.  A key part of this effort is recruiting mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists to this area of biomedical research.    Minority Programs  An important component of the NIGMS mission is to administer research and research training programs aimed at increasing the number of minority biomedical scientists in the United States.  In the past 3 years, NIGMS funding for all of its minority programs has nearly doubled, predominantly due to funding research at a more enabling level and to implementing new programs for minority student development.  In recent years, the number of minority students participating in one particular research program, the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Program, has risen sharply, nearly doubling from 1997 to 2000.      Future Initiatives       Centers of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems Research  NIGMS recognizes that biomedical research is entering an era in which computational approaches will be vital to deepening our understanding of biological behavior.  In addition to research contributions, NIGMS-funded Centers for Excellence in Computational Biology will provide academic institutions with the means to make interdisciplinary research in complex biological systems and bioinformatics attractive career options for both established and beginning investigators.  The institutions will receive the resources to recruit new investigators who have the skills needed to develop new methods and tools, and to develop appropriate training programs in computational and information sciences.  This program is part of NIGMS' activities under the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI).    Centers of Excellence in Chemical Methodology and Library Development  These centers will encourage chemists to develop new methods to create ""combinatorial chemistry libraries.""  Such libraries, which are collections of diverse molecules, are already important drug discovery tools, but they are now limited by current methods.  By establishing the centers, NIGMS intends to encourage collaboration between chemists, engineers, and biologists.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality and structural diversity of combinatorial chemistry libraries and to improve scientists' access to high-quality libraries for use in studying biological processes.    Instrumentation  NIGMS plans to offer funding opportunities for scientists to invest in state-of-the-art research tools such as the following:      900 megaHertz NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) imagers.  These new ultra-high-field machines can provide a much higher-quality picture of large proteins, and they can even detect protein and sugar molecules in motion as they carry out their biological functions.     ""CryoEM"" (cryo-electron microscopy).  This and other forms of so-called high-resolution microscopy can enable researchers to view molecules and cells much more clearly than is possible using other microscopic techniques, thus promoting a better understanding of fundamental biological entities.  In particular, the three-dimensional arrangement of molecules can be much better discerned using new, experimental techniques of this type.  NIGMS has already invested, and will continue to invest, in advancing technology in this area.    Synchrotron supplements.  The NIGMS synchrotron initiative will continue to provide support to enhance instrumentation and support additional staff at four U.S. synchrotrons.  These facilities are essential workhorses for scientists using X-ray crystallography to decipher the shapes of proteins.  By providing funds to upgrade synchrotrons, NIGMS continues to play an important role in opening up use of these extremely expensive pieces of equipment to many more biomedical researchers.  In addition, NIGMS, in partnership with the National Cancer Institute, is planning the development and operation of two new ""beamlines"" at the Advanced Photon Source — the newest and most advanced U.S. synchrotron — at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois.      Expansion of Current Efforts  NIGMS will continue to nurture the following areas of science with future NIH budget increases:      Interdisciplinary, collaborative science (planning to fund at least one more large-scale ""glue"" grant)     Pharmacogenetics (planning to enhance the Pharmacogenetics Research Network)    Structural Genomics (planning to expand the Protein Structure Initiative)         National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  (NICHD)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Learning and Learning Disabilities  Nurturing children's ability to learn is critical to their lifelong success and functioning.  This effort supports a range of activities to better understand how inherited, biological, and environmental conditions mold human learning and behavior.  Complementary efforts translate this knowledge into effective interventions.  The long-term goal is to develop dynamic research methods and a strong, scientific evidence base to support effective and developmentally appropriate interventions to maximize the learning and reading ability of all children, with and without learning disabilities.   Significant progress has been made on many fronts.  In terms of determining ""what works,"" the NICHD established the National Reading Panel to assess state-of-the art research concerning the best methods to teach reading in our nation's classrooms.  After publishing the Panel's report, ""Teaching Children to Read,"" extended efforts are being made to disseminate the findings broadly and to prepare training materials for teachers.  Scientifically-based protocols to improve reading skills and prevent reading failure among the highest risk children in Washington D.C schools are just ending.  Preliminary data show that the interventions significantly reduced reading failures in all participating schools.  Even schools where children were reading overall at the 10th percentile level reached the 50th percentile in just one year.  In addition, new grants will support critical research to understand the specific cognitive, cultural, and instructional factors that promote or impede English reading and writing for Spanish-speaking children.  Recently, a conference was held to develop early assessment models and a research agenda for early intervention programs for children, from birth to age 6, at risk for reading failure, which will guide our next research expansion in this area.   Other initiatives target children with special needs.  The extension of the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism will add new studies on language development and early cognition in children with autism.  New studies concerning cognition in individuals with Down's syndrome are also being funded.  The Science and Ecology of Early Development initiative — to understand how social, economic, and environmental disadvantages influence social, emotional and cognitive development B has led to studies targeting school readiness and language development among lower income children.  Researchers are also being asked to address how early literacy is best achieved in homes where parental literacy is low, and how adult literacy affects lifelong functioning and health.  Finally, the expansion of the Learning Disabilities Research Program is applying new neuroimaging technology to assess brain changes following treatment programs for children with language and reading difficulties.    Women's Health Initiatives  This effort supports a broad range of complementary initiatives that address understudied, and often unique and preventable health conditions that seriously threaten or affect the quality of life of millions of women worldwide.  This broad effort will develop and help bring to market safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive microbicides to help women protect themselves from HIV infection; help researchers better understand, diagnose, and treat a range of urogynecologic and pelvic floor disorders, from incontinence to prolapse and vulvodynia, and support the infrastructure needed to train the next generation of clinicians dedicated to women's health research.   Over the past several years the NICHD published over 10 RFAs and PAs with set asides addressing these issues. To prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, academic and non-profit researchers are working with private industry developing, and trying to bring to market, novel microbicides.  Behavioral studies will ensure that these products are acceptable to and used by a wide range of women while basic research studies will help design more targeted and effective compounds.  Newly funded projects will aid researchers in understanding normal female pelvic structure and function as well as the disease processes related to pelvic floor disorders.  Clinical trials of improved ways to treat these conditions will soon be under way.  Several new projects promise to unlock the biology of and risk factors associated with the poorly understood, yet disabling condition, vulvodynia, while linking findings to improved treatment strategies.  Nearly 60 scholars have been appointed in the 20 new Women=s Health Research Career Development Centers, which have been established nationwide to allow newly trained OB/GYNs to enter research careers addressing such concerns as endometriosis, fibroids, and hormone regulation.  Other initiatives ensure that OB/GYNs obtain rigorous training in epidemiology and clinical trial methods.    Preventing Birth Defects and Inherited and Developmental Disorders  Building on the revolutionary advances in human genomics, this effort encourages researchers to develop new technologies along with new strategies to diagnose and prevent a range of birth defects and inherited and developmental disorders.  The many initiatives in this effort should advance technologies to characterize the genetic control of early development; develop molecular and genetic tests to diagnose early abnormal development in humans; and design safe and effective treatment and prevention strategies to prevent birth defects — the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S. — and many other developmental disorders such as Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, and autism.   The NICHD continues to lead trans-NIH efforts to expand research that uses animal models with easy-to-visualize embryos such as the zebrafish and the frog, Xenopus.  These expanded activities will provide data on the function of developmentally relevant genes and create new ways to observe changes in early body structures and organ systems over time.  A new facility to create and share mouse models for human birth defects has also been started.  Novel studies will integrate the latest advances from developmental genetics, genomics, epidemiology, and statistical modeling to help researchers better understand the distribution of birth defects in populations.  Collaborating bench scientists and clinicians, working in newly established multidisciplinary research centers, will use the data to improve diagnostic tests as well as strategies to treat and prevent birth defects.  Concurrently, new grants will examine the genetics, disease mechanisms, and biomarkers for Rett Syndrome, a crippling brain disorder that strikes baby girls.  Support from the Fragile X Research Foundation will help fund grants targeting the genetics and neurobiology of Fragile X, the most common form of inherited mental retardation in the U.S.  In addition, expanded support for the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism will enhance research on the genetics of autism.  Finally, a series of related projects plus a major, multiagency, longitudinal cohort study will examine how genetic factors interact with other biological, environmental and behavioral variables, starting in the fetal period, to produce chronic disease and influence long term health outcomes.    Medical Rehabilitation  This effort includes complementary initiatives that expand scientific resources in the field, while developing advanced technologies and novel interventions to address such concerns as traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury, pediatric rehabilitation, and neural and tissue plasticity and recovery.  Long-term goals for this effort include transforming medical rehabilitation research into a mature science using and improving state-of-the-art technology, as well as acquiring and translating basic and clinical knowledge into innovative interventions that markedly improve the functioning and quality of life of persons with a range of disabilities.   A combination of broad and targeted initiatives have already been implemented to achieve these goals.  To establish a resource intensive foundation upon which to expand medical rehabilitation research nationwide, four regional networks have been established.  These partnerships bring together researchers from various disciplines to cross-fertilize ideas, maximize access to the newest technologies, and attract experienced researchers in the field while training new ones.  Building on this concept, a recent initiative encourages investigators to develop innovative, non-surgical or pharmaceutical, interventions to advance rehabilitation therapies by supporting pilot studies and proof-of-concept projects.  In addition, over 35 new grants will help investigators find better ways to image, analyze, and repair soft tissue injuries and find new ways to try to enable people to walk after spinal cord injury.  Researchers have also been asked to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using pharmaceutical agents, normally used to treat adults after TBI on children, and to develop pilot studies to establish the basis for going forward with full-scale clinical trials.  Finally, researchers will soon be using functional imaging to assess the brain's circuitry, which is related to cognition and behavior, and is affected by TBI.  The insights gained by these studies will allow scientists to assess and compare the best way to overcome the long-term consequences of TBI.      Future Initiatives     Reducing Preterm Births  Much of the difference in infant mortality rates between African American and non-African American infants appears to be related to infection-associated preterm birth. To further investigate this link, the NICHD will supplement existing clinical trials and initiate new ones. This will allow researchers to assess the most effective strategies to treat and prevent infectious and inflammatory diseases in pregnant women at greatest risk of preterm birth. The Institute will also fund new studies to specifically examine the genetic factors that may contribute to preterm delivery and the continuing disparities in preterm birth rates.    Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Native American Communities  While public outreach initiatives to place infants on their backs to sleep have helped to reduce overall SIDS rates, disparities in SIDS rates and in adoption of risk reduction behaviors persist.  The Institute will evaluate its intensified outreach to African American communities to help reduce these disparities and to encourage more African American babies to be placed on their backs to sleep.  The Institute will also expand its outreach to Native American communities, where the highest SIDS rates in the U.S. exist.  Due to the prevalence of heavy drinking on some reservations, as well as preliminary data showing a strong association between alcohol exposure and SIDS, the NICHD will collaborate with the NIAAA and the at-risk communities to examine how prenatal alcohol exposure affects the developing fetus.  The long-term goal is to develop specific therapeutic and culturally appropriate preventive strategies to protect the mother and her developing child.    Basic and Clinical Research Targeting Uterine Fibroids  The NICHD will expand its efforts to better define the causes and most appropriate treatments for uterine fibroids -- the most frequently diagnosed tumor of the female pelvis, the number one reason for hysterectomy, and a condition that disproportionately affects African American women.  This effort will include research on the factors that lead to uterine fibroids, and support for clinical trials to assess the most effective pharmaceutical treatments and surgical approaches.    Cooperative Reproductive Science Research Centers At Minority Institutions  This effort will foster independent and competitive research capabilities of faculty, students, and fellows at minority institutions by encouraging collaborations with other NICHD-funded programs in the reproductive science.  Particular emphasis will be placed on research addressing reproductive biology, physiology, and genetics; reproductive endocrinology; and reproductive medicine encompassing infertility, gynecology, and andrology.    Male Reproductive Health and Contraceptive Development  The NICHD will support collaborative biomedical and behavioral research to develop novel scientific approaches to regulating male fertility.  The goal is to develop male contraceptive products that are acceptable to and easily adopted by men.  The Institute will also support career-development and training grants to develop a new cadre of investigators who are dedicated to advancing male reproductive health and contraceptive research.    Behavioral Interventions for Preventing Unintended Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)  A critical goal of the NICHD's strategic plan on reproductive health is to reduce the high rate of unintended pregnancy in the U.S. by influencing sexual behavior and by improving contraceptive use and services.  Building on its previous research efforts, the NICHD will support basic research on the specific factors that influence the decision to continue, discontinue, or switch contraceptive methods.  Related research will focus on preventing STDs and other reproductive tract infections, which disproportionately affect minority communities.  Based on this information, researchers will be able to develop interventions that are culturally sensitive, cost-effective, and sustainable within the targeted community.    Normative and Adverse Behavior in Teens  Other than the first three years of life, there is probably no other time when developmental changes occur so rapidly and so profoundly as during the teen years.  To better understand these processes, the NICHD will support research to understand how interactions between the brain, hormones, and environmental stimuli lead to changes in teen behavior at the onset of puberty and into young adulthood.  Researchers will also examine how these processes are modified by such external factors as peers, family, and the community. This research holds promise for significantly expanding our scientific understanding of this complex developmental period, and highlighting new ways to prevent adverse behaviors, including violence, in teens.     Self-Injurious Behavior  One of the most challenging problems in managing and treating developmental disabilities is self-injurious behavior (SIB).  Up to 20 percent of all people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities engage in repetitive SIB, and 40-50 percent of individuals with autism injure themselves.  Based on recommendations from a recent workshop, the Institute will support studies to unravel the complex interactions that lead to SIB, including how alterations in neurological ""circuitry"" in multiple brain regions may cause SIB.    Fragile X  To sustain and more effectively exploit rapid advances in the field, and to implement a recent Congressional mandate, the NICHD will initiate new center activities targeting the genetics and clinical treatment of Fragile X.  Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation in the U.S. and provides a research avenue to study other inherited conditions.     Clinical Trials for Pediatric Trauma Rehabilitation  Although injuries and violence are the most frequent causes of death in 5 to 18 year-old children, many clinical treatments for trauma are tailored exclusively to adults, or fail to consider the long-term effects of such interventions on the developing child.  Based on preliminary data gained from planning grants for pharmacological and other interventions in pediatric TBI, the NICHD will expand successful pilot studies into full-scale clinical trials.  Related initiatives will broadly examine the effects of other forms of trauma at the cellular level, and in relation to developing tissues, organs, and systems of children.  Additional studies will target the relationship between acute care and rehabilitative treatments for children, and the impact of socioeconomic, cultural, and other factors on short- and long-term health outcomes.     Cooperative Multicenter TBI Clinical Trials Network  The NICHD will also launch its multicenter TBI rehabilitation network for adult patients.  This network will develop and conduct clinical trials of therapeutic techniques, procedures, devices and pharmaceutical agents to improve the function of people with traumatic brain injury.  Researchers will also investigate the underlying biology of these interventions.     Timing, Intensity, Duration of Rehabilitation for Stroke and Hip Fracture  Strokes and hip fractures account for the majority of inpatient rehabilitation days and expenses for the elderly.  Unfortunately, current medical practices are more heavily influenced by reimbursement rules from such payers as Medicare than by actual empirical research detailing optimal treatment schedules.  The NICHD will work with the Health Care Financing Administration in a unique collaboration to design and support clinical trials to evaluate and determine optimum rehabilitation therapy schedules and techniques.        National Eye Institute  (NEI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Advanced Vision Research Instrumentation Initiative  This initiative was intended to establish collaborative programs to create innovative and effective approaches to satisfy vision research instrumentation needs.  As a mechanism of support, the NEI is cooperating with other institutes in sponsoring Bioengineering Science and Technology Partnerships.  Progress in the production of advanced vision research instrumentation requires multidisciplinary research teams that include bioengineers, basic scientists, and clinical scientists capable of supporting an integrative systems approach to this research.  Among the goals of this initiative are the development of assistive devices for the visually impaired, imaging devices to improve non-invasive examination of ocular tissues for both research and disease diagnosis, instruments to analyze the biomechanics and visual performance of the eye.   The NEI is currently funding six partnerships under the advanced vision research instrumentation initiative.  These projects include:  development of a long-term implantable retinal stimulator for patients blinded by retinal degenerations; investigation of ways to enhance the accessibility of intersections for pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired; development of an instrument to measure the physical properties of the retina and to create images of retinal microstructure; and merging of advances in optics and molecular and gene therapy technologies to produce images of neural activity in the visual centers of the brain.    Identification of the Genes Expressed in the Visual System  This initiative allowed the NEI to significantly increase its research to identify and sequence genes that are expressed in the visual system.  The identification of important eye genes, their nucleotide sequence and patterns of expression will be a tremendous resource for vision scientists investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in visual system development and the genetic basis of blinding eye diseases.  The ultimate goal of this initiative is to generate a complete set of full-length cDNA clones and their sequences from the visual system, which will provide more comprehensive information on the protein coding regions.  Additionally, emphasis is being placed on developing efficient methods for quantifying the expression of genes in microdissected tissue samples.   High-quality cDNA libraries are being prepared from ocular tissue that are representative qualitatively and quantitatively of the genes expressed in the visual system and are optimized to detect rare or unique sequences.  Specific cDNA libraries are being produced from both mouse and human eye tissues such as retina, lens, cornea, optic nerve, and visual cortex and discrete regions of eye tissue.  Work is currently underway in the NEI intramural program to make this catalogue of genes expressed in the visual system publicly available in an easily accessible and retrievable database through a NEI-supported website.      Future Initiatives       Diabetic Eye Disease Initiative  The NEI will support two new initiatives that were among the recommendations of the Congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working Group.  The first involves evaluation of new treatments for diabetic macular edemaa condition in which damaged retinal blood vessels leak fluid and lipids (fats) that cause swelling of the macula and blurring of vision.  The treatments include both medical and surgical approaches.  A pilot study is being planned in NEI's intramural clinical research program to test methods for evaluating less intense photocoagulation, vitamin E supplementation, and lipid lowering.  The pilot study is intended to set the stage for a major multicenter randomized clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.  The second initiative will identify genetic associations in patients with microvascular complications of diabetes.  The NEI will supplement the Family Investigation of Nephropathy in Diabetes study funded by NIDDK to investigate the genetics of individuals and special populations  of patients with renal disease.  The NEI will support detailed eye examinations for these patients and will search for genetic associations with microvascular disease.   To identify other areas of genetic research that may aid in the prevention or more effective treatment of diabetic retinopathy, the NEI convened a workshop in September 2000 to explore whether recent advances in genetic research increased the opportunity for understanding the genetic predisposition underlying the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.  A multidisciplinary group of clinicians, epidemiologists, statistical geneticists, and molecular geneticists examined the existing evidence for genetic factors influencing the development of diabetic retinopathy.  They also determined whether recent work on the development of diabetic nephropathy provided approaches which could be exploited for studies of diabetic retinopathy.  Nine recommendations from the workshop identifying collaborations to pursue and research studies to develop and implement are currently being finalized.  These recommendations will form the basis for expanding current research and developing future program initiatives.    Initiative on Degenerative Diseases of the Retina  The NEI will provide funds to support collaborations of scientists that could merge different scientific disciplines and technologies, share access to services and facilities, and provide a comprehensive approach for applied research on ocular diseases and disorders.  Several scientific areas such as gene therapy for retinal degenerations, rehabilitation of low vision, gene therapy for pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and the treatment of diabetic retinopathy have generated approaches that the NEI would like to see move more quickly into clinical trials or applications.  As a means of hastening this progress, the NEI plans to expand extramural and intramural support for collaborative multidisciplinary research focused on the development of novel therapies to restore or prevent the loss of function due to visual diseases and disorders.   Many visual system diseases are complex, and the rapid and efficient translation of research findings into clinical application will require a comprehensive and highly integrated approach.  Such a collaborative approach would be particularly appropriate for therapeutic research that involves a biological intervention, such as gene therapy or pharmacological approaches.  For example, the development of new therapies in the treatment of retinal degenerations using gene replacement therapy will require collaborations among geneticists who have identified and cloned a defect-specific gene, molecular biologists who can produce appropriate vectors, cell biologists with animal model systems in which to test products, and clinical researchers who can perform Phase I and/or II human safety and/or efficacy trials.  Similarly, pharmacologic treatments to preserve function, reverse degenerative processes, or facilitate transplantation strategies with neuroprotective agents, growth factors, or other biologics could require collaborations among pharmacologists who can isolate and purify factors, chemists who can synthesize drug delivery systems, cell biologists, bioengineers, toxicologists, and clinical researchers.  The creativity of such interdisciplinary teams is expected to result in the development of innovative clinical applications.        National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  (NIEHS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Genetic Basis of Environmental Susceptibility  Health and disease arise from complex interactions of genes and environment as a function of age and stage of development.  Scientists are now realizing that defining gene-environment interactions will be necessary to understand the root causes of most major diseases ( Science , 278:569, 1997 and 106:365, 1998;  Epidemiology , 9:211, 1998;  Nature Reviews Genetics , 1:149,2000).  The Environmental Genome Project (EGP) was initiated to identify critical variants in environmental response genes that could potentiate or ameliorate environmentally associated diseases such as cancer, birth defects, asthma, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease. Currently efforts are underway to identify these variants and to establish a database of these findings that can be used by researchers throughout the world.    Mouse Genome Centers  Much of the progress in understanding and treating human diseases has come from research using experimental animals.  NIEHS is establishing five regional Mouse Genomics Centers to construct genetic models that represent specific variants of environmental response genes that confer enhanced susceptibility.  The mouse models containing these susceptibility genes will be provided to the scientific community for use in studies to better define gene-environment interactions that lead to common diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.    Toxicogenomics Initiative  Estimates are that 70-75% of the high-volume, high-use chemicals (~15,000) in commercial use in the United States have not been assessed for human toxicity or carcinogenicity. Current toxicity assays are too costly and take too long to perform to relieve this information shortfall.  To address this need, NIEHS is spearheading a national effort to merge the field of toxicology with genomics, creating a science of toxicogenomics that identifies toxicant activity at the genetic and molecular level through use of small DNA microarrays.  These arrays, where thousands of genes can be put on a single slide, use gene expression profiles or signature patterns to determine  which agents are toxic or carcinogenic. To advance this novel and promising field the NIEHS is establishing five regional Toxicogenomics Centers.  Their work will lead to toxicity test systems that can be cheaper, faster, and more informative than those currently in use.    Parkinson's Disease  A recent study ( JAMA , 281:341, 1999) showed that environmental components accounted for the majority of Parkinson's Disease (PD) cases that developed after age 50.  Based on these findings, the NIEHS recruited more university-based researchers to investigate gene-environment interactions that increase risk to PD.  We are funding 25 grants to investigate the role of environmental agents such as pesticides, solvents, and metals as risk factors for Parkinson's Disease.  We are also supporting research to develop animal models of the disease.  Findings from these studies will lead to new insight into the etiology of PD, will identify new prevention strategies, and may well suggest new therapeutic strategies to cure the disease.    Children's Environmental Health  In most cases, children are more vulnerable than adults to adverse effects of environmental exposures because of their rapid growth and immaturity of various organ systems.  To better protect this vulnerable population, NIEHS partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish ten Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Centers.  These centers are devoted to defining environmental components of common childhood disorders such as asthma, learning and behavioral disorders, and birth defects.  This information will be used both to design prevention strategies and to help educate pediatricians to better identify environmental components of childhood disorders.    Health Disparities  It is well recognized that the poor in this country have much increased risk of low birthweight babies, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, breast and prostate cancer and other diseases.  They also tend to live in environmentally compromised environments with high exposures to lead, air pollutants, and other toxic compounds.  The NIEHS has spearheaded an NIH-wide effort to increase research into health problems of the poor.  Additionally the NIEHS has initiated programs that foster scientific careers and achievement of students at historically underserved colleges and universities so that minority students can be recruited as future environmental health researchers and bring important insight in health disparities research design and implementation.      Future Initiatives       Genomics  As initial results from the Environmental Genome Project, Mouse Genomics Centers, and Toxicogenomics Centers are available, more resource-intensive follow-up will be required.  Identification of environmental response genes in the EGP will necessitate incorporation of this information into environmental epidemiology studies; mouse models will need to be tailored to specific human health conditions; and a large, publically accessible database will be maintained for information generated by the Toxicogenomics Centers.  This overall effort will begin to yield important clues into which environmental toxicants play a role in specific human health conditions and which individuals are most susceptible to them.  Pharmaceutical and agricultural firms will be able to better tailor their products to eliminate undesirable side effects and physicians might be able to better predict which of their patients could have adverse reactions to specific drugs.    Sister Study of Breast Cancer  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the role of gene-environment interactions remains to be completely defined.  The NIEHS will establish a large cohort of women who have a sister with breast cancer and, thus, are at increased risk of developing this disease.  These women will be followed longitudinally and will regularly fill out lifestyle/exposure questionnaires.  It is estimated that within five years of study initiation, important information will begin to be generated about genetic and environmental influences on breast cancer risk.    Learning Disabilities and Neurobehavioral Disorders  Learning disabilities, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other neurobehavioral deficits are increasing at an alarming rate.  To define the environmental components of these disorders, the NIEHS will be supporting initiatives to bring better focus to gene-environment interactions and the importance of the timing of environmental exposures in subsequent development of learning disabilities.  Information from this research can then be used for effective prevention strategies and, depending on the toxicants identified, could suggest ways for more effective interventions and treatments.    Neurodegenerative Diseases  Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease are increasingly recognized as having important environmental components ( JAMA , 281:341, 1999;  JAMA , 285:739; 2001).  NIEHS will be enhancing research into the important genetic and environmental conditions that lead to these debilitating diseases.  Outgrowths of this research could lead to intervention strategies, better identification and counseling of at-risk groups, and therapeutics that either reduce risk or delay the disease.    Health Disparities  NIEHS will expand its emphasis on the conditions that lead to poorer health among the disadvantaged.  Studies will be conducted to better define the gene-environment interactions that lead to diseases predominant among U.S. minority populations, particularly asthma, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and gynecological conditions such as uterine fibroids.    Exposure Assessment  Federal studies such as the NHANES survey are able to show the types and levels of exposures that are common in the U.S. population. The critical information — what are the health implications of these exposures — is lacking.  The NIEHS is developing a research program that provides insight not only on the types of toxicants to which people are exposed, but the health implications of these chemical burdens, particularly what levels are safe and what levels cause disease.        National Institute on Aging  (NIA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative  The NIA AD Prevention Initiative is an intensive, coordinated effort to accelerate basic research and the movement of basic research findings into the development of novel compounds to delay or slow the progress of AD or to prevent the disease entirely.  Intervention studies aimed at people caring for AD patients will develop and test ways of managing the stresses of caregiving and to reduce caregiver burden.  These studies may ultimately lead to the development of specifically targeted drugs to block the onset of AD as well as develop drug and behavior management interventions to ease the burden of caregiving and delay nursing home placement.   Since the Initiative started, basic research has identified promising new targets for directly blocking AD pathology; new mouse models of AD have been developed; clinicians are developing imaging and other tests for persons in early stages of the disease, focusing on persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for AD; and pilot and full scale clinical trials have been initiated.  Major prevention trials started include one testing vitamin E and Aricept on persons with MCI, and others testing anti-inflammatory drugs and estrogen.  Treatment trials with estrogen patch, anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamins for slowing progression and two trials for preventing agitation have also been started.     Longevity Assurance Gene Initiative (LAG)  The LAG is comprised of a multidisciplinary group of scientists studying several models of aging and longevity.  The goal of the LAG is to stimulate the development of research projects focused on unraveling the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms which modulate longevity and enhance health span.  The LAG now encompasses 30 investigators working on twenty-seven R01-supported research projects.  LAG investigators have identified genes that seem to modulate aging in several lower organisms.    Genetic Epidemiology Initiative  The Genetic Epidemiology Initiative includes studies to increase understanding of how genetic factors influence healthy longevity, including the risks for the presence or absence of a disease ""survival traits"", the age at which an individual develops a disease, and the rate at which the disease progresses (""rate-of change"" traits).  The goal is to identify the genes related to healthy longevity.   NIA issued an RFA for exploratory projects in May 1999. The RFA solicited proposals to identify appropriate populations, phenotypes, designs, and methods for longitudinal genetic epidemiologic studies to identify genetic effects on rates of age-related physiologic and pathologic changes, and/or survival outcomes such as age of onset of disease and disability. Nine projects have been funded and awardees have had their first annual meeting with NIA staff to exchange information on study progress.    NIA Exercise Campaign  In 1999, NIA launched a nationwide campaign to encourage older people to exercise with the publication of its free manual,  Exercise: A Guide from the National Institute on Aging .  The guide, which is based on scientific evidence, is intended to help people design their own exercise program so they will maintain and enjoy it.  In an effort to reach more people and accommodate individuals' different needs, the book has been translated into an exercise video.  The long-term goal of this initiative is to encourage more people, especially older people, to start and maintain an exercise program.  Research supported by the NIA and other NIH Institutes has shown that exercise has many physical and mental benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease, preventing osteoporosis, relieving moderate depression and improving pain management.  It can also help to delay the onset of disabilities and life-threatening diseases.  Thus, it is vital that the NIA play a leadership role in encouraging more people to exercise.   A good measure of the initiative's progress is the public's response.  Since 1998, the NIA has distributed over 364,594 copies of the exercise guide.  15,245 copies of the video, which was released in 2000, have been distributed as well.     Gene Expression Microarrays in Aging Research  Microarray technology allows investigators to determine the activity of many thousands of genes at once.  The goal is to profile changes in gene activity that may lead to better understanding of the molecular basis for aging and eventually provide useful biomarkers of the aging process itself, markers that might be important in assessing the effectiveness of strategies to retard adverse aging-related processes.  Comparing normal age-related changes with the changes characteristic of early stages in a disease process will pinpoint altered cellular pathways and suggest strategies for intervention.   A unique collection of 15,000 mouse cDNA clones has been made freely available to the scientific community. Over 100 facilities worldwide have received the set and have started to prepare microarrays.  The set is now being expanded to 30,000 genes.      Future Initiatives       Alzheimer's Disease Vaccine Initiative  NIH is implementing a five-year initiative to speed the development of vaccine and other novel approaches for preventing AD.  In a recent breakthrough by pharmaceutical company scientists, repeated long-term injections of an amyloid vaccine has been found to cause an immune response in test mice, nearly eliminating amyloid plaques and associated neuropathology.  These studies are being confirmed and extended by NIH-funded scientists who have shown improvements in cognition in immunized animals.  A recent request for applications has set aside FY 2001 funds for studies on the mode of action and efficacy of vaccine-based interventions.    Large-scale Interventions to Reduce Frailty and Disability:  Testosterone Replacement Therapy  The potential of testosterone replacement therapy in older, hypogonadal men to prevent and or treat disease and disability is an area of ongoing research.  Major interest focuses on possible benefits in the strength of muscle and bone, body composition, cardiovascular health, sense of well-being, and mood and cognition.  Investigators are trying to establish not only the possible beneficial effect of replacement therapy in this group, but also to assess the incidence of potentially dangerous side effects including a possible increase in benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer.  As part of a possible collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs in the area of multi-site clinical trials in geriatric medicine, the NIA has participated in a planning effort for a large-scale trial of testosterone replacement in hypogonadal, osteopenic older men with a primary endpoint of ""time to first clinical fracture.""    Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials  The Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study, the consortium of AD Centers and other Institutions, will initiate studies to develop more cost-effective ways of conducting expensive prevention trials.  It will also test a number of different approaches to slowing the course of AD including treatment with statins, as well as investigate whether valproate will decrease agitation while slowing AD cognitive decline.   Pilot and full scale trials from individual investigators are in development, including several to find other effective ways of reducing behavioral problems.    Healthy Brain Aging  The FY 2000 National Academy of Sciences study, The Aging Mind, has stimulated a number of interlocking initiatives.  These include in depth analysis of age-related changes in particular cognitive domains as they occur in cognitively normal individuals and in those in early stages of neurodegenerative disease; the effect of culture and lifespan changes on cognition and the aging brain, including risk and preventative factors for healthy brain aging; the cause and effect relationship between age-related brain and behavior changes; and development of biological and behavioral interventions to promote healthy brain aging.    Disability Decline Among Racial and Ethnic Minorities  In the mid-1990s, NIA-supported investigators reported improvements in disability rates from an analysis of data from the National Long Term Care Survey.  They determined that at least 1.2 million fewer older Americans were disabled in 1994 than there would have been if disability rates had not improved since 1982.  Additional studies, conducted by the same and other groups of investigators, have suggested that this decline is continuing.  Research is now focusing on the factors contributing to the disability decline so that specific interventions and behavioral changes can be identified to accelerate this trend.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2002, the NIA plans to launch an initiative to explore the factors that may influence the decline of disability in various racial and ethnic groups, including research to design more culturally appropriate interventions and modes of health information dissemination.        National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases  (NIAMS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Increased Research Support for Osteoporosis  Highlights of increased research opportunities and progress in osteoporosis include a seven-year study that was initiated to determine the extent to which the risk of fracture in men is related to bone mass and structure, biochemistry, lifestyle, tendency to fall, and other factors, and this study will also try to determine if bone mass is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.  Little is known about osteoporosis in men, although they can suffer severe consequences of fracture.  The Institute also initiated clinical studies to determine if combinations of some of the drugs available for osteoporosis will be more effective and have fewer side effects than any of the drugs alone.  In addition, the NIAMS is teaming with the NHLBI in issuing an RFA on bone formation and calcification in cardiovascular disease in January 2001.     A Multipronged Approach to Research on Scleroderma  Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that causes hardening of the skin and can affect major organs.  The NIAMS increased the approaches we use to study scleroderma, including expanding the existing registry of scleroderma to the identification of multiplex families and a DNA repository; funding a Specialized Center of Research in scleroderma; and issuing an RFA in the molecular pathways and new interventions in scleroderma.    A Clinical Trial on Low Back Pain  A study comparing surgical versus nonsurgical treatments of patients suffering from low back pain was initiated in 1,450 patients at 11 medical centers with funds awarded by the NIAMS.  This project is expected to have a major impact on clinical practice and on the cost of medical services for persons with back pain.  Pain involving the lumbar spine is not only one of the most prevalent health problems for which people seek medical help, it is also one of the most costly in terms of medical treatment and disability involving days lost from work.    Improved Understanding of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Other Spondyloparthropathies  Ankylosing Spondylitis is a painful, deforming, inflammatory joint disease that leads to spontaneous fusion of the vertebra.  The NIAMS recently issued an RFA to encourage projects that explore new approaches and hypotheses on the pathogenesis of Ankylosing Spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies, as well as to promote the development and pilot testing of new therapeutic approaches, including alternative and complementary medicine. We have also initiated a large multicenter study to explore the role of genetics in disease causation.    Skin Biology and Skin Diseases  Skin research has lagged behind in two key areas — common vocabulary to describe skin diseases and a sufficient cadre of clinical investigators being trained in dermatology.  The Institute has partnered with the Herzog Foundation to address both of these areas of need.  We are soliciting a contract to develop a national and international dermatology lexicon for use by the entire research community, and have also developed a fellowship program in epidemiology and health services research, and outcomes research in skin.  Finally, we have broadened our Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Centers so that they may include studies in skin.      Future Initiatives       Improved Understanding of the Muscular Dystrophies  In May 2000, the NIAMS sponsored two scientific workshops to lay the groundwork for research into the muscular dystrophies.  The first workshop, sponsored by the NIAMS together with the NINDS, the NIH Office of Rare Diseases, the FSH Society, Inc., and the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America, focused on the cause and treatment of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD).  The NIAMS and the NINDS have already used the recommendations from this meeting in developing and issuing an RFA in FSHD in November 2000.  As well, the NIAMS and the NINDS have recently funded a research registry for FSHD and myotonic dystrophy.  The second workshop focused on therapeutic approaches for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and the NIAMS and the NINDS subsequently issued a Program Announcement, ""Therapeutic and Pathogenic Approaches for the Muscular Dystrophies"" in January 2001.  This PA uses set-aside funds for FY 2002 - 2004.    Increased Research Focus on Osteoarthritis  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis.  Based on the recommendations from a very successful scientific workshop recently sponsored by the Institute, the NIAMS issued a recent RFA on prevention of onset, progression, and disability of osteoarthritis.  In addition the Institute is establishing (with the NIA) a public-private partnership to develop clinical research resources that support discovery and evaluation of biomarkers and surrogate endpoints for osteoarthritis clinical trials.    Initiating a Program in Clinical Research Training at Minority Serving Institutions  Minority institutions have had difficulties developing and sustaining independent clinical research, and there is a shortage of ethnic minority clinical researchers who are pursuing successful clinical research careers.  The NIAMS, in partnership with NIDDK and NCMHD and 9 other NIH components, created a new strategy for enhancing clinical research training in minority-serving institutions.  The first phase, to be funded in FY 2001, is a solicitation for a one-year planning grant, and the second phase will be a 5-year grant to assist in the actual development of the clinical research curriculum, with the funding in FY 2002 and beyond.  A successful program will produce well-trained clinical researchers who can lead clinical research projects.    Creating an NIH Center of Musculoskeletal Medicine  The NIAMS, NIDCR, NICHD, and NIA are prepared to focus resources in this area and form a new collaborative Center of Musculoskeletal Medicine on the NIH campus.  This would build on the strengths that are already present and are beginning to be coordinated, enhance research productivity through synergy of the programs, develop new programs, recruit new investigators, and make it possible to create a national resource in this area.  The Center would include basic science, incorporate an Inter-Institute Bone and Cartilage Clinic, and integrate new clinical programs in osteoarthritis and molecular orthopaedics.    A Health Partnership Program  to Address Health Disparities  Recently, the NIAMS Intramural Research Program launched the Health Partnership Program, a diversity outreach initiative to reduce health disparities in diseases of the joints, muscles, bones, and skin among minority communities.  The Institute has designed a model community-based program that will first address health issues related to arthritis and other rheumatic diseases in African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos in the metropolitan, Washington, D.C. area.        National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders  (NIDCD)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Hearing Aid Clinical Trial  Although numerous studies have suggested that hearing aids provide significant benefit, carefully controlled, large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted to determine the amount of benefit.  The NIDCD and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted a multicenter trial to compare the efficacy of three commonly used hearing aid circuits.  The goal of the trial was to determine which hearing aid circuit provided most benefit to hearing aid users.  Data from the trial showed that differences among the three hearing aid circuits were minimal and that each circuit improved speech recognition, with improvement observed for soft and loud speech under both quiet and noisy listening conditions.    Treatment for Otitis Media  Otitis media (middle ear infection) is one of the most significant health problems for children in the U.S. costing approximately 4 to 5 billion dollars annually.  It is the most common reason for a sick child to be treated by a physician.  Current treatment options for otitis media, which rely heavily on the use of oral antimicrobials, are being increasingly hampered by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms.  Novel therapeutic approaches need to be pursued.   NIDCD scientists have developed a detoxified lipooligosaccharide-protein conjugate to be used as a possible vaccine against nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, a leading cause of otitis media in children for which there is no vaccine available.  Currently, a Phase I clinical study is nearing completion in adult volunteers to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine.  Preliminary data from this study shows that the vaccine is able to elicit the production of a specific antibody against the bacteria in a number of volunteer subjects.  The results of this trial suggest that this investigational vaccine may be useful for preventing otitis media in children.      Future Initiatives       Genetic Testing and the Clinical Management of Hereditary Hearing Impairment  Advances in the genetics of hereditary hearing impairment and in the early identification of hearing impairment have now converged.  These advances have led some to suggest genetic testing/evaluation for all infants who are identified with a hearing loss at birth.  In consideration of these developments, the NIDCD is planning an initiative to address the clinical relationship between genetic and audiologic/otologic information, as well as to address the clinical validity and utility of genetic testing in the diagnosis, treatment and management of hearing impairment. With the identification of genes that contribute to hearing function, genetic testing becomes possible, but does not necessarily imply that genetic testing is ready for widespread clinical application.  Additional research is needed to meet the unique challenges pertaining to testing for hearing impairment because these conditions are not universally considered to be disabling or even undesirable.    Early Identification and Intervention for Infants with Hearing Impairment and Other Communication Disorders  This initiative is supporting clinical studies/trials to determine and validate outcome measures to evaluate and develop intervention strategies for children identified with hearing impairment, determine which strategies are optimal for a given child in their environment, and to introduce these intervention strategies into clinical practice.  At present, there are efforts underway in many states to screen all infants for hearing impairment in the newborn nursery before discharge from the hospital.  This screening will result in many more infants being identified with hearing impairment at an early age when intervention strategies can be started that will optimize their long-term speech and language skills.  However, more research is needed to develop and validate intervention strategies and to determine the relative efficacy of various intervention strategies in infants and children with hearing impairment or other communication disorders.      A Comparison of Intervention Programs for Children with Language Impairment  Language impairment (LI) is a prevalent problem affecting approximately 7% of all school-age children in the U.S. and their families with significant related consequences to society including social, educational, and vocational costs.  Despite decades of providing language intervention to school age children, there are few studies measuring outcomes related to the intervention, and there has never been a randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of any language intervention procedures.  Recently, a computerized intervention method, known as Fast ForWord, has been developed and has received national attention.  In response to these findings, NIDCD-supported scientists will conduct a randomized clinical study to compare the language outcomes of children using Fast ForWord to two other interventions (computer assisted language intervention without acoustically modified speech and individual language intervention) and to the outcomes of a general control condition.  The primary goal of the study is to determine which intervention will result in the greatest improvement in language scores in children with LI.  The researchers will also seek to determine which intervention results in the greatest gains in conversational language, produces gains after 3 and 6 months of training, results in the greatest improvement in auditory perception, and is most cost effective.        National Institute of Mental Health  (NIMH)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)  CATIE encompasses two large-scale community-based clinical trials being conducted to compare the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the treatment of the aggressive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.  The two independent protocols in CATIE (Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's) are being conducted under one research contract funding mechanism and one coordinating center.   The goal of the schizophrenia study is to enroll approximately 1800 patients to determine the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications relative to each other and relative to conventional antipsychotic medication.  The goal of the Alzheimer's study is to enroll 450 patients to compare the acute efficacy and effectiveness of three atypical antipsychotic medications in treating psychosis and severe agitation in outpatients with Alzheimer's Disease.  Both protocols have been developed and the 50 schizophrenia trial sites and 30 Alzheimer's trial sites have been selected.  The first 12 subjects have been enrolled in the schizophrenia trial.  Enrollment is expected to continue for approximately 24 months.    Trans-NIH Neuroscience Initiative on Mouse Mutagenesis  This trans-NIH initiative is an effort to exploit genetic and genomic resources in the mouse to more fully understand mammalian neurobiology.  Its goal is to identify and characterize the function of genes as they produce defects in mouse nervous system functioning and complex behavior.  These implicated molecules and pathways are expected to inform genetic research in humans, and greatly accelerate the dissection of the genetic bases of mental disorders.  NIMH has worked with six other NIH Institutes to organize 3 large-scale mutagenesis centers to conduct high-throughput phenotyping and genome-wide mutagenesis in the mouse.  The project set milestones to obtain at least 200 mutants/year, which will be widely distributed to the scientific community.    Translational Research in Behavioral Science  This initiative will develop research centers that support the translation of basic behavioral science research to patient-oriented studies regarding etiology, new interventions, and delivery of services for mental disorders. As an integral element of the initiative, NIMH will provide grants (using the R21 pilot/exploratory mechanism) that will better enable researchers to develop the infrastructure and procedures, as well as pilot data, that will be useful in competing successfully for either a translational RO1 grant or a translational center.  The goal is to develop more powerful, theory-based interventions and service delivery models for mental disorders through increased application of the data and paradigms of basic behavioral research.   NIMH issued an RFA for developing centers and anticipates receiving approximately 35 applications by the April 2001 deadline.  A program announcement (PA) regarding fully-implemented centers is expected to generate three to five applications for an October, 2001 deadline.    Clinical Neuroscience Research Centers  This initiative is an effort to make substantial inroads with respect to our understanding of the neurobiological substrates of the major mental disorders.  This Centers will help to translate the advances, technologies and approaches of 21st century neuroscience into mechanistic understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of the major psychiatric illnesses.   The recent increases in the NIH budget have permitted very substantial expansion of this program.  Specifically, in FY 1999 and FY 2000 5 new Clinical Neuroscience Research Centers were funded:  Harvard (Joseph Coyle, MD); New York University/Rockefeller University/Columbia (Joseph LeDoux, PhD); University of California/University of Michigan (William Bunney,  MD); Emory/Yale/Princeton (Charles Nemeroff, MD, PhD); and Columbia (John Mann, MD) focused on schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders, and suicide.      Future Initiatives       Gene Hunting for Schizophrenia and Manic-Depressive Illness: Capitalizing on the Human Genome Project  Breakthrough advances in the genetic bases of mental disorders are now expected, given the recent availability of the complete human genome sequence, and new tools and technologies for genetic analysis. This initiative will support the novel application of massively parallel approaches to map genes that produce vulnerability to schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and related biological traits. Innovative statistical and molecular genetic methods will be utilized for the global analysis of patterns of gene expression, genetic variation, and protein expression in these mental disorders. This initiative also aims to fund high-throughput projects that target the whole genome to identify in schizophrenic and manic-depressive patients those genes that influence therapeutic response to one of several compounds (e.g., anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anti-manic drugs).    Autism Centers of Excellence  NIMH will be the lead institute in establishing a program for Centers of Excellence in Autism.  This centers network will be organized as specified in the Children's Health Act of 2000.  NIMH and the other participating institutes (NINDS, NICHD, NIDCD, and possibly others) will issue an RFA for developmental grants in FY 2001 for funding in FY 2002 to facilitate the development of translational research teams and the organization of planned research programs and collaborations.  In FY 2002, an RFA will be issued for the Centers of Excellence program for funding in FY 2003.  This RFA will incorporate the stipulations regarding centers contained in the Children's Health Act and will fund, either in the first year or in successive competitions, at least 5 Centers at approximately $1.5 million per center per year total costs.  The Centers will be organized into a network for collaboration and the sharing of materials and data.    Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology and Psychosocial Interventions (RUPPs)  The purpose of this initiative is to continue and expand the currently ongoing research network on Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology to include up to nine new units plus a coordinating center.  The initiative will focus on important clinical questions about the use of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents, with special emphasis on safety and drugs already used in the community without adequate testing. The intent is to expand the scope of RUPP research by including research in psychosocial treatments as well.  Treatment interventions for subjects with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders will also be areas of special emphasis.    Early Therapeutics Development Program  Existing psychiatric therapeutics are highly successful, yet many patients retain residual symptoms and disability that deserve substantial new effort in treatment development.  In order to address these needs, NIMH plans to initiate a new program to spur the early development of drug and psychosocial therapies for mental disorders.  Impetus for such a program stems in part from the fact that many patients are referred for treatment because of symptoms that either fall outside canonical psychiatric syndromes or which persist despite partial remission of the symptoms of canonical disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Because FDA approval of medications is geared toward full psychiatric syndromes rather than individual symptoms, there is decreased incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to develop critically needed symptomatic treatments.  In addition, there are compounds potentially useful for treating mental disorders that either are off-patent or represent ""long shots"" and, therefore, have not been fully tested by industry.  In the development of psychosocial treatments, industry obviously has no incentives.   The new therapeutics development program would be an Institute-wide, integrated effort, requiring the development of new symptom rating and outcome scales, for example, in the area of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia or irritability in mood disorders and the identification of promising classes of compounds.  The Institute would work with academic scientists and, ideally, with the biotechnology industry to bring promising compounds through early phase II trials, a point at which industry would be willing to develop them further.  For psychosocial treatments, NIMH would have responsibility for necessary clinical trials.        National Institute on Drug Abuse  (NIDA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN)  Thanks to generous support from Congress, NIDA was able in FY 1999 to jump-start the establishment of what has already become a national clinical research infrastructure for testing science-based drug addiction treatments in real-life community-based treatment settings.  Until the establishment of the CTN, researchers and treatment providers had to rely on treatment results from studies conducted in specialized settings with somewhat restricted populations.  The CTN now provides the infrastructure to rapidly and systematically bring new treatments to diverse patient populations across the country.  By forging partnerships between researchers and community treatment providers who are serving on the front lines of clinical practice, the CTN is engaging the entire drug abuse community in a national effort against addiction and its consequences.  Additionally, the CTN provides a much needed infrastructure to more efficiently and rapidly disseminate other kinds of research findings to practitioners and patients across the country.  The CTN seeks to improve the quality of drug abuse treatment nationwide using science as the vehicle.   Since the inception of the CTN in September 1999, this national research infrastructure has grown to include 14 research centers across the country working in partnership with over 80 community treatment providers that use quite varied approaches and serve diverse patient populations.  Patients are already participating in the first seven protocols.  Patient protocol brochures have been developed in both English and Spanish.  An additional 17 new protocol concepts have been submitted to NIDA and are in various stages of pre-implementation review.    Genetics  In 1999, the confluence of both progress in the science and a generous appropriation enabled NIDA to launch a major ""Vulnerability to Addiction"" initiative.  The goal of the endeavor is to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors and how they contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to becoming addicted.  NIDA received an overwhelming response to the ""Genetics of Vulnerability"" RFA when it was first announced in 1999.  Even with the increased financial support, NIDA was only able to fund half of the excellent proposals received.  Further increases have allowed  NIDA to expand its support of genetic research to the point where we now have over 60 major projects using the full array of genetic analysis techniques so as to maximize the probabilities of successfully identifying critical genetic factors.  This initiative should help elucidate the interacting roles of genes and environment in addiction, resulting in better treatment and prevention strategies.   Researchers are learning more about what causes individual differences in vulnerability to addiction.  It appears to be a combination of genetic and environmental input, with the genetic portion accounting for anywhere from 30 to 80 percent, depending on the drug.  Given the completion of the human genome project and the advances in technology that have led to the identification of genes contributing to many complex diseases (including diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases) there is now reasonable optimism that researchers will be able to find genes that influence complex bio-behavioral diseases such as addiction.  Additionally, NIDA has been able to make much progress to encourage the genetics community to work together to share data.  For example, under NIDA's leadership a dozen grantees under the original genetics RFA have formed a NIDA Genetics Consortium to regularly discuss issues related to both NIDA's human molecular genetics program and individual projects.  A repository for storing and ultimately sharing data and materials generated from genetic grants has also been established.    Neuroscience of Addiction  NIDA's entire neuroscience portfolio is benefitting from generous financial support.  The convergence and application of powerful new scientific tools and emerging technologies are accelerating NIDA's neuroscience advances and allowing researchers to ask questions that were not possible just five years ago.  Some examples of new initiatives that are being fueled by a sustained budget increase include a multistaged strategic effort to better understand the mechanisms that underlie the transition from occasional drug user to compulsive user or addict; the use of new non-invasive neuroimaging technologies to determine the effects of drugs on the developing brain of children and adolescents; and a more focused effort to understand the role that cognitive factors such as learning and memory processes play in the development, maintenance and expression of compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use — the hallmarks of addiction.  These initiatives will help scientists develop a greater understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of addiction that can lead to new behavioral and pharmacological treatment approaches.   Neuroimaging technologies are helping us to understand the long-term effects on the brain of drugs such as methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy).  Emerging technologies are also helping us to predict who may be most likely to become a drug user.  For example, scientists have discovered that the amount of dopamine D2 receptors an individual has may predict whether or not that person will find using a drug to be pleasant. With the increase funding received by the Institute, NIDA announced two mechanisms to rapidly stimulate novel research on understanding the transition from drug use to addiction.  NIDA also was able to initiate a Neurobiology of Development Initiative, which is helping us to determine the structural and functional effects of prenatal drug exposure on brain development and whether children with early drug exposure are more vulnerable than non-exposed children to cognitive deficits and later drug abuse as they move into adulthood.  These sophisticated techniques are also allowing researchers to ask how drugs of abuse compromise an adult's cognitive and behavioral abilities.    Responding to Emerging Drug Problems  With increased funding, NIDA has been able to expand its research portfolio in all domains to combat emerging drug problems before they become national epidemics.  NIDA has long maintained an early warning system for emerging drug problems called the Community Epidemiology Work Group.  Enhanced funding has allowed the Institute to respond much more rapidly to the warning the CEWG provides.  For example, in December 1999, NIDA launched a Club Drug Research and Education Initiative in response to indicators suggesting an emerging epidemic of club drug use. NIDA has since made much progress in determining the long and short term consequences of many so-called club drugs and in educating the public, scientific, and professional communities about the consequences of using club drugs, such as methamphetamine, MDMA, and GHB.   NIDA will continue its efforts to establish a more integrated research and public education mechanism to avert emerging drug epidemics.  NIDA will identify potential public health hazards that are drug related, rapidly alert the public and health communities, and stimulate new research to develop new treatments and antidotes.  NIDA has made much progress in increasing our understanding of the dangers of club drugs and facilitating improved prevention and treatment efforts.  A high priority for NIDA was to ensure that the world is shown the residual effects that drugs, such as methamphetamine and MDMA, can have on the brain and body even after the individual stops using the drug.  NIDA was also able to release a number of new RFAs including one that focuses on the drug, GHB, and one that focuses on prenatal exposure to methamphetamine.  NIDA also has an aggressive information dissemination campaign on this topic.  NIDA, in collaboration with community partners, has initiated a series of public information activities to disseminate science-based information about the consequences of club drugs, including mailing a Community Drug Alert Bulletin on Club Drugs to almost half a million physicians, treatment providers, nurses, and clinicians across the country; providing fact sheets on club drugs through our fax-on-demand service, ""NIDA Infofax"";  and distributing hundreds of thousands of  ""art-cards,"" postcard-like advertisements encouraging people to contact NIDA for research-based information.  Public service announcements are also being aired nationally on this topic.        Future Initiatives       Expansion of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network  In FY 2002,  NIDA plans to increase the national coverage of the Network to include additional sites in geographic areas now unrepresented and to include approximately 160 treatment programs.  NIDA's plan is to have 10 to 20 research protocols being run at any one time.  These protocols will include tests of treatment approaches shown to be effective in laboratory settings or suggested by practitioners in the field, and they will be tested in the full array of treatment settings that exist across the country.  Those programs, in turn, will be providing treatment to diverse patient populations, including those of different ethnic and racial origins and gender preferences, adolescents, pregnant women, and poly-drug using individuals.    Establishing a National Drug Prevention Trials System  NIDA will launch an initiative to develop a National Drug Abuse Prevention Trials System that will test proven research-based efforts in a wide variety of populations.    Expansion of NIDA's Genetics Research Portfolio  NIDA will continue to support the development and utilization of powerful tools to identify the genes and gene products that render vulnerability to addiction and are altered by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse and by external factors (e.g. stress, environmental stimuli associated with drug use) that influence the development of this illness.  For example, NIDA will continue to encourage researchers to develop and  use advanced molecular genetic techniques, such as gene arrays, that can help researchers assess the changes in the expression of many genes simultaneously after drug exposure.    New Treatments for Nicotine Addiction  NIDA will significantly expand its nicotine research portfolio to focus on the development of more effective treatments to combat nicotine addiction.  For example, NIDA will continue to develop smoking cessation interventions that are tailored to adolescents.  NIDA is also planning to work with NCI to expedite the development of nicotine medications.    International Testing and Dissemination of Science-Based HIV Prevention and Treatment Findings  NIDA will support cross-national and international studies to determine what can be useful and adapted by foreign communities that are particularly vulnerable to the AIDS epidemic.  NIDA will also continue to nurture the development of its Global Research Network on HIV Prevention in Drug Using Populations.    Improving Drug Abuse Treatment Tied to the Criminal Justice System  NIDA will encourage researchers to conduct rigorous scientific study to better understand the types of treatment programs that are now being used at various points while addicted offenders are under criminal justice control, identify the most successful or model programs, and from that information develop a set of best practice principles about duration, setting, and training to help frame a more effective system of treatment for addicted criminal offenders.  At the same time, NIDA will stimulate research designed to foster the development of even more effective science-based approaches to treatment for this unique patient population.        National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  (NIAAA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Neuroscience and Neurogenetics: The Sum is Greater than its Parts  Additional funding is enabling us to conduct one of our most essential tasks: to integrate the different fields that contribute to our knowledge about how alcohol acts on the brain. The long-term goal is to identify biological points for intervention in alcohol-use disorders by integrating the research of relevant fields.   How we behave toward alcohol depends largely on genetic and molecular activities in our brains.  These biological responses to alcohol translate into behaviors and play a major role in deciding whether dependence on alcohol will consume our lives or whether we can simply enjoy it occasionally, without problem.  Integrating the many fields that contribute data about alcohol's actions in the brain — from genetics to molecular biology to behavioral science — is crucial to our ability to capture meaning from the data these various fields generate.   We need, for example, to draw relationships between specific genetic and molecular events in the brain and specific behaviors relevant to alcohol use.  We need to understand how inducing genetic and molecular changes in these events affects behavior.  We need computer models to manipulate and interpret these activities and to share information between disciplines.  Ultimately, we need to integrate this information so that we can identify the neural circuits — networks of nerve cells and the thousands of molecular and genetic events associated with them — that underlie the biological process of becoming dependent on alcohol. This kind of integration is beyond the scope of any single discipline and requires a major initiative that previously was not financially feasible.   An important component of our research involves biochemical and genetic changes unique to the brains of children and adolescents that put them at risk of alcoholism later in life   Additional support has enabled us to establish an Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism and to fund a range of research proposals that will contribute to our ability to meet our goals.  Recent genetics technology (microarrays) is contributing information that will lead to identification of genes in the brain that play a role in alcohol-use disorders.  Research made possible by additional funding also has generated new information about the vulnerability of the adolescent brain to alcohol.    New Areas of Intramural Study  The NIAAA Intramural Program has established three new laboratories that will conduct research in areas previously not represented in the Program. The budget for these laboratories is entirely dependent on funds from the doubling of the NIH budget.  Our aim is to identify points for intervention in biological mechanisms that contribute to alcohol's harmful behavioral and physiological effects.   The Laboratory of Physiologic Studies will focus on neuroendocrinology and liver biology.  Some of the brain mechanisms that regulate appetite for food also appear to influence appetite for alcohol.  The NIAAA Intramural Program now can conduct systematic studies on the role of these substances in alcohol-related behavior.  This laboratory now also enables the Intramural Program to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to alcohol-induced liver disease (responsible for the majority of cases of liver cirrhosis in the United States), including genetic factors.  The Laboratory of Physiologic Studies has discovered a novel role of substances in the brain in control of appetite; ongoing studies suggest that these substances are involved in control of alcohol preference in mice.  This laboratory also has identified cellular proteins responsible for alcoholics' remarkably poor response to interferon therapy for treatment of hepatitis C. Targeting these proteins may offer a novel approach to treatment.   The Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience is enabling the Intramural Program to investigate the neural basis of alcoholism. Evidence is strong that brain proteins not only are affected by alcohol, but also are among the major regulators of alcohol-seeking behavior.  Identification of these proteins is possible only through an integrative approach that combines the study of single cells and molecules with behavioral studies in animals, including genetically altered animals.  Additional funds have enabled us to add the elements of an integrative approach that previously were lacking.   The Laboratory of Molecular Physiology is enabling Intramural investigators to understand how alcohol produces its effects at the cellular level. Activities in nerve cells of the brain are triggered by outside chemical ""signals"" to molecular channels in the cells' protective membrane and to molecular connections between the cells.  Alcohol affects these signaling systems, leading to changes in behavior.  Additional funding is allowing us to alter these signaling pathways, to observe each component's effect on cellular and behavioral response to alcohol.  The combination of approaches — molecular biology, mouse genetics, electrophysiology, and rodent behavioral science — and the staff with expertise necessary for this work would not have been possible without additional funds.    COMBINE: Phase III Trial of Combinations of Pharmacotherapy and Behavioral Therapy  Additional funds have enabled NIAAA to conduct a pivotal Phase III clinical trial that is testing synergistic effects of pharmaceutical and behavioral treatments.  Although current treatments for alcoholism already are moderately successful, the prevalence and costs of alcohol-use disorders in the U.S. (14 million Americans and $185 billion each year, respectively) make crucial NIAAA's search for treatment strategies that are highly effective among a wider population of alcoholics.  In the past, budget constraints have limited most NIAAA clinical studies to Phase II trials, a necessary step in the development of treatments, but one that is smaller and less definitive than the Phase III trial.  Project COMBINE builds on previous NIAAA-supported research on behavioral treatments and pharmacotherapies, and will include studies of the pharmacogenetics of the medications used.  An economic component will provide data on cost effectiveness of therapies.  Our goal is to give clinicians the knowledge necessary to prescribe optimal combinations of medications and counseling.   COMBINE is underway at 11 clinical sites throughout the country and a coordinating center.  Recruitment of more than 1,200 patients has begun.     National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)  To understand a disease's impact on U.S. public health and the treatment needs this disease generates, scientists must conduct longitudinal epidemiology studies.   To date, the NIAAA budget has limited us to studies of prevalence, the occurrence of alcohol-use disorders at a given point in time. Additional funding now permits NIAAA to conduct the first estimates of the incidence — the rate of development of new cases — of alcohol-use disorders and of disabilities associated with these disorders in the U.S. general population of adults.  This data that will provide direction for research in the basic science, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-use disorders.   The design of the new study will provide scientists with crucial information, unobtainable through prevalence studies, about how these disorders develop and about factors that influence remission, chronic drinking, and incidence.  The study also will enable scientists to examine unmet treatment needs of people who have mental and physical illnesses in addition to alcohol-use disorders.  Scientists also will obtain the first estimates of adverse drinking practices and alcohol-use disorders among the entire U.S. college-age population. The first of two waves of surveying necessary to obtain the kind of data we seek is prepared to take place in July 2001.    Prevention  The NIAAA has gathered critical data on what kinds of interventions are likely to be effective in preventing alcohol-related problems in specific populations.  However, budget constraints prevented us from testing those interventions, except in a limited way.  With increased funding from the doubling of the NIH budget, we now are able to test interventions in four areas that particularly need them.      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS): FAS and related birth defects are completely preventable if pregnant women abstain from alcohol.  These deficits cost the Nation $2.8 billion annually, in health-care costs alone.  FAS occurs more often among some ethnic groups than others.     College Drinking: Several factors converged to make college-drinking a prime target for intervention testing.  At the same time research was showing that almost half of all students surveyed had engaged in binge-drinking, the media was reporting alcohol-related student deaths.  Colleges and universities were pressing the NIAAA for advice, but funding issues prevented us from responding as fully as we could have, even though we had data on promising interventions.     Drinking Among Ethnically/Economically Diverse Youth:   Project Northland tested interventions simultaneously conducted in school, family, and community that delayed initiation of drinking by largely white, rural adolescents in Minnesota. However, we do not know if the same strategies are as effective in ethnically and economically diverse urban youth, and budget constraints have prevented us from testing these successful interventions in these settings.  The doubling of the NIH budget enables us to test these interventions in urban communites.  Delaying initiation of drinking is crucial; research has shown that people who begin drinking earlier in life have a much higher risk of alcoholism than do people who begin later.    Driving-Under-the -Influence-of-Alcohol (DUI) Recidivism: Athough alcohol-related fatalities and alcohol-impaired driving have decreased in the U.S., an intractible core of repeat offenders continues to destroy lives and property.  Budget limitations have prevented us from testing the effectiveness of specific sanctions, singly and in combination, for dealing with these and other DUI offenders.  New funding enables us to conduct research that will provide judges, prosecutors, and other decision-makers with a scientific basis for their choices of sentences for DUI offenders.    Our goal is to identify interventions that are effective in preventing FAS, college drinking, drinking by urban youth, and DUI recidivism.  We have launched a special initiative that resulted in eight new studies that will test promising interventions for prevention of FAS.  A special initiative to stimulate tests of college-based prevention strategies resulted in 11 new intervention studies, and NIAAA's Advisory Council formed a Subcommittee On College Drinking.  University presidents and NIAAA-affiliated researchers have formed two panels to address the context and consequences of college drinking and prevention strategies.  We have issued a new Request for Applications to test the strategies successfully used in Project Northland in urban settings.  A  program announcement sponsored by NIAAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has resulted in five new studies, in which judges and researchers are cooperating in determining which sanctions work best for DUI offenders.  In a major advance, judges have agreed to randomize offenders to experimental and control sanctions, to negate their own preference biases and those of the offenders.   All of these efforts are made possible by the doubling of the NIH budget.        Future Initiatives    College Drinking Requires Joint Effort by Researchers, Colleges, and Communities Media reports of alcohol-related deaths of college students are just one manifestation of a complex problem deeply entrenched in the college culture and in the communities surrounding colleges.  Additional funding from the doubling of the NIH budget now enables us to add research that will further our understanding of college drinking and result in better-informed intervention design.  A crucial effect of the additional funding is that we now can test interventions that show promise in reducing college drinking.  Previously, budget constraints prohibited us from doing this on a large scale.   We have reviewed existing research on the contexts in which college drinking occurs and its consequences, and on prevention and treatment, and have identified gaps in the research that we now can address.  For example, studies have shown that partnerships between community organizations reduce drinking in the general population, but we need to evaluate whether partnerships between community organizations and colleges can reduce drinking among students.  We also need to evaluate the effects of specific campus alcohol policies.  In addition, investigators would benefit from capturing data on the effects of alcohol-related policy changes that occur outside their purview, such as those imposed independently by lawmakers in the community or by campus administrators.  The lack of longitudinal studies that track alcohol-related behaviors from high school through young adulthood also presents a gap in the data.  A NIAAA-supported data and surveillance system will facilitate research in all of these areas.   NIAAA's Advisory Council formed a Subcommittee On College Drinking, in which university presidents and NIAAA-affiliated researchers have formed two panels to address the context and consequences of college drinking and prevention strategies.  Additional funding is enabling us to implement the recommendations these panels issued in their reports.   As part of our new college drinking initiatives, we also plan to disseminate our findings.  For example, we will sponsor regional and national workshops for college presidents and administrators and will distribute educational material developed for specific groups, such as students and administrators.    Neuroscience and Neurogenetics  The following activities are described under ""Current Initiatives Made Possible by Doubling of NIH Budget.""  However, an increase in funding would enable us to further expand these activities in FY 2002.  At that time, we will apply additional funds to noninvasive imaging techniques that will track alcohol's effects in animal and human brains.  The 2002 expansion will include functional and genetic (microchip) studies aimed at identification of the genes involved in alcohol-use disorders; these studies also will contribute vital information to medication-development efforts.  Perhaps most important, the 2002 expansion will establish an informatics database that will facilitate integration of neuroscience data across the many fields that contribute to it, speeding translation of the data into clinically useful information.    Advanced Research Program  Additional funding has enabled NIAAA to conduct high-risk research which, if successful, could result in breakthroughs on difficult alcohol-related problems.      Biosensor Creates New Possibilities for Tracking Alcohol Levels:  Researchers and clinicians lack accurate methods of continuously measuring long-term drinking in humans.  Technological advances now have made possible the development of a tamper-proof biosensor that continuously measures alcohol levels.  Currently, long-term alcohol use is measured through personal interviews or questionnaires, and these self-reports are subject to memory and the desire to give socially acceptable answers.   By measuring how much and when people drink as a matter of course, in daily life, the biosensor could provide accurate assessments of whether clinical interventions are effective in preventing drinking.  The biosensor also could contribute to our understanding of changes that take place in the brain as it adapts to chronic alcohol use.  Continuous measurements of alcohol levels in various organs could contribute to our understanding of how the body disposes of alcohol.    Theoretical and Computational Neurobiology:  This research is intended to identify circuits of nerve cells, in the brain, that are involved in biological adaptations to alcohol use.  These circuits may be involved in sensitization, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, recover, craving, and relapse.    Geostatistical Modeling:  This research will develop new geomathematical techniques designed to prevent alcohol-related problems in inner city and Department of Defense populations, and on Indian reservations and college campuses and surrounding communities.  It will provide researchers with a much better ability to track the effects of various environmental factors on alcohol misuse.  The resulting information would be useful to policy-makers; for example, those who regulate zoning and licensing.     Genetically Engineered Rodents: A Valuable Tool for Alcohol Research  More than a year ago, the NIAAA joined other NIH Institutes in providing funding for establishment of mouse mutagenesis centers. In this approach, scientists create random, single-gene mutations in many mice.  By screening them, scientists from different fields can select mice whose mutations have resulted in traits of interest, for use in studies.  With the doubling of the NIH budget, we now have the funds to screen these mice to identify those whose mutations cause altered responses to alcohol.  Next, we will pinpoint the locations of the altered genes, which will provide us with information for finding those genes in humans.  We then can test whether the human genes play a role in heavy drinking among people.   Of particular interest is identification of genes, in rats and mice, that underlie biological mechanisms that permit an animal to drink alcohol to such excess that it is physically unable to drink any more.  In the case of this trait--the ability to drink to that point--we suspect that genetic variations in the physiologic feedback loop that normally would signal animals to stop drinking play a role.    National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)  This initiative appears under ""Current Initiatives Made Possible by the Doubling of NIH Budget.""  A second wave of surveys will occur in 2004; it is this second wave of data-gathering that will enable us to glean information, previously unavailable, about factors that influence remission, chronic drinking, and incidence of alcohol-use disorders.        National Institute of Nursing Research  (NINR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Enhancing Adherence to Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors  Nursing research is critical to help patients deal effectively with chronic illnesses, including diabetes. Building on the recommendations of the Congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working Group, NINR expanded efforts to focus on this clinical population to improve both patient adherence to diabetes treatment and quality of life.  A program announcement, Enhancing Adherence to Diabetes Self Management Behaviors, was announced to increase the research activity.  Current studies are evaluating barriers to treatment adherence in African American women with gestational diabetes; testing a culturally specific intervention for Native Americans who have diabetes; and establishing baseline beliefs among three low-income ethnic groups in a rural community, so that diabetes treatment and long term follow-up can be culturally congruent with those beliefs.  Notable recent findings show that adding a coping skills intervention to routine care promotes better diabetes control and improved quality of life in adolescents.    Collaborations with Clinical Trials  This initiative stimulated the submission of research to complement ongoing clinical trials that are studying promising therapies.  A request for applications, Clinical Trials:  Collaborations for Nursing Research resulted in the funding of six studies that are investigating family functioning during stroke recovery, endocrine function and conduct disorders in children, sleep and fatigue with dexamethosone treatment in childhood cancer, self-care to prevent urinary incontinence, patient outcomes in elders with heart failure, and psychosocial factors in sudden cardiac death.  The additional funds in 2000 allowed us to capitalize on the good response to the initial request for applications.  We issued another RFA to further promote collaborations between established clinical trials and nurse investigators.    End-of-Life Research  This initiative seeks to fill the gaps in knowledge that limit the evidence base for optimal care of the dying.  An RFA in 1999 Research On Care At The End Of Life resulted in 10 studies funded on clinical management; communication among the patient, family and health care team; decision making about life sustaining treatments; cultural preferences in end-of-life care; and interventions to support the bereaved.  A 2000 program announcement, Quality of Life for Individuals at the End-of-Life, was justified by the strong response to the initial RFA and continuing knowledge gaps.  An NIH-wide End of Life Research Interest Group was established to promote coordination of initiatives across NIH components.  NINR and its interest group partners sponsored a community dialogue: The End of Our Lives: Guiding the Research Agenda- to build on the interest generated by the PBS series by Bill and Judith Moyers.  Recent findings from one of our investigators demonstrated that the existence of an advance directive, whether written or verbal, eased the burden on the family, reduced the stress associated with the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, and allowed more attention to focus on the quality (rather than quantity) of life.        Future Initiatives       Health Disparities Research Initiatives  With continued funding increases NINR would significantly expand activities in health disparities in two areas.  Research on Diabetes Management in Minority Populations will generate studies of self-management, adherence and other behavioral aspects of diabetes treatment in order to design effective methods of diabetes control in various cultural/ethnic groups.  Studies are needed to improve self-monitoring and adjustment of lifestyle factors and to determine how to actively involve minority groups in developing and testing intervention strategies.  Secondly, an NINR and NIH-sponsored national meeting with minority nurse associations clarified the need for issuing an initiative on Health Disparities Centers and Career Development.   This call will stimulate health disparities research in NINR centers and increase the number of researchers, especially minority researchers, who are well prepared to carry out this research.    Research on End of Life  The public's interest and support of end-of-life research is matched by enthusiastic response from the scientific community.  NINR's expansion of end-of-life research will support research into the knowledge gaps identified in the future directions conference scheduled for October 2001.  The areas of focus for additional research include the experience of dying; factors that determine where people die; methods and measurement issues in end of life research; and ethical implications of end of life research.  Another area where funds would support significant initiatives is in identifying and managing the unique end-of-life issues in persons with rare genetic diseases.    Infrastructure Development-Nursing Research Training and Centers  With additional funds, NINR could increase the growth of the pool of investigators needed to conduct nursing research.  Special emphasis would be directed toward facilitating early entry into doctoral training and career development programs, in order to address the specific recommendation for NINR in the recent National Research Council report, Addressing the Nation's Changing Needs for Biomedical and Behavioral Scientists.  An expanded training and centers program not only begins to address a national shortage of nursing researcher-faculty, but it also increases the cadre of minority and disadvantaged investigators.  An expanded Centers program will enhance interdisciplinary research training opportunities.  Schools targeted with this expansion are those that have not received major NIH support.  NINR will encourage research depth in areas including health disparities, end of life/ palliative care, chronic illness and genetics.    Caregiving  One out of four family members is a caregiver who must meet the complex requirements of the patient while meeting personal needs and obligations.  The number of people providing long-term care outside of institutional settings is increasing rapidly due to the aging of the population, the limited access to high quality long-term care and the expense of this care.  A new initiative on Informal Caregiving in Non-Institutional Settings will support studies that test interventions to provide caregivers with the skills and information they need to meet complex demands, delay institutionalization and promote quality of life both for caregivers and those cared for.        National Human Genome Research Institute  (NHGRI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Sequencing the Human Genome  In June 2000 the Human Genome Project completed a working draft of the DNA sequence of the human genome.  A complete description of this scientific tour de force, and the remarkable surprises that were uncovered, was published in February 2001.  This clearly represents one of the most important milestones ever encountered on the never-ending quest to better understand ourselves and the wonder of life.  Because of the increased funding provided to NHGRI, the draft sequence was achieved much faster than previously predicted.  Over 30 genes for human diseases, including various types of cancer, deafness, and birth defects, have been identified using this working draft.  Researchers are now using that information to go to the next step of developing better diagnostics and therapeutics.  Had the sequencing not been done so quickly, or not made immediately available in public databases, those diseases would still be mysteries.  Researchers are now working to fill any gaps in the draft and finish the sequence to high quality, final form no later than 2003.    Mouse Genome Sequence  The effort to sequence the genome of the laboratory mouse was launched by NIH under NHGRI leadership in October 1999.  The mouse sequence is critical information needed to interpret the human genome. In October 2000 the effort was accelerated by creation of  the Mouse Sequencing Consortium (MSC) — comprising three private companies, six Institutes of the NIH and the Wellcome Trust.  Without the additional funds provided to the NIH institutes, mouse sequencing would have started much later and the current goal of finishing the mouse sequence by 2005 would not be possible.  Already researchers are using the mouse sequence to speed the process of decoding the human genome.  As an example,  researchers at Merck recently utilized the mouse sequence to trim more than a year off of their research program to  develop a new drug for schizophrenia.     Human Genetic Variation  The DNA sequence of any two people is 99.9 percent identical.  The 0.1 percent difference includes genetic variations that have no effect at all, as well as variations that are associated with differences in the risk of getting various diseases or having an adverse drug reaction.  Now that nearly 3 million of these variants have been discovered and placed in public databases, researchers working on the genetics of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, mental illness, and a host of other medical problems are empowered to move forward much more swiftly than previously possible.  The additional funds have moved this area of research along very rapidly and the goals set for 2003 have already been achieved.   Human genetic variation studies are also being expanded to focus more specifically on how information generated by genetic variation research is likely to affect the ways in which culturally and socioeconomically diverse individuals and groups understand, access and use genetic information and health services.    Advanced Development Program  This program, initiated in FY 1999 with the increased funding, is designed to speed the transition of Human Genome Project critical technologies from developers to users and support intensive collaboration between technology developers and the laboratories that would use the technology for high-throughput sequencing.  These projects will disseminate cost-effective sequencing and genomics capabilities more broadly throughout the research community, to the benefit of scientific progress in many areas.  Examples under development include a sequencing machine that can run 4 times the number of samples without increasing instrument size, and liquid handling that can reduce sample volumes (and thus reagent costs which currently represents over 50 percent of sequencing costs) by 10-fold.    Education Kit  NHGRI has designed and produced a kit to educate, engage, and excite users about the human genome and genetics.  The primary target audience is high school students, though a much broader use with college students, voluntary health organizations and the general public is anticipated.  The kit includes a multimedia CD-ROM, wall poster of the genome, an informational brochure and a video documentary.  The kit was released concurrently with the publication of the human sequence in February 2001.  Without increased funding, this project would not have been possible.      Future Initiatives       Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science  This program has just been initiated to stimulate the development of new genomics approaches and integrate them with biomedical research.  Now that the human draft sequence is in hand, there are unprecedented opportunities to bring together interdisciplinary high throughput approaches to understanding health and disease.   The program also provides important training opportunities for a new generation of research scientists and bioinformaticians.  The response from the research community has far exceeded the ability of NHGRI to support all of the exciting high-quality proposals in FY 2001.   Increases in FY 2002 and beyond would be used to support additional centers, focusing on new approaches to genome-wide analysis in areas such as: regulation of gene expression; protein expression and interaction;  gene and protein networks; human genetic variation related to health and disease.  Other centers will focus on the storage, analysis, and distribution of comprehensive data sets; and the collection of high quality data to support these scientific analyses in the most cost-effective manner possible.    Databases of Genomic Information  The large amount of genetic information being produced is most accessible and useful to researchers when it is in public databases.  A critical need is to expand and improve current databases and create new ones as the need arises.  In FY 2002, NHGRI will increase its support of databases on model organisms, especially mouse, fly, worm, and yeast; expand the development of standard database modules that can be adapted for use by any organism community; and evaluate and expand databases containing protein information.     Genetic Variation Research and Health Disparities  An on-going initiative in NHGRI is to explore how socioeconomic factors, gender, and concepts of race and ethnicity influence the use, understanding, and interpretation of genetic information, the use of genetic services, and the development of policy.   In FY 2002, NHGRI will initiate a new program of studies to address these topics as they relate to health disparities.  The program will seek to evaluate how increased public awareness and understanding of genetic variation and its role in health and disease can help to reduce existing health disparities.     Model Organisms, and Comparative Sequencing  Now that most of the human genome sequence is available, much work is needed to interpret the function of all the parts.  Several approaches to doing this will be developed, but a key will be having the genome sequence of other organisms for comparison.  Because functionally important sequences are conserved, comparison between human and other organisms will help to identify many important features, including genes, gene structure, and regulatory and other non-coding functional elements.  The mouse sequence is already well underway and sequencing of the rat genome has begun.  However, many more sequences will be needed.  NHGRI is developing a process for prioritizing additional organisms to sequence beyond mouse and rat.  Already another species of the fruit fly and a tunicate have been identified for sequencing in FY 2002.  A workshop to develop criteria for choosing additional organisms will be held in July 2001.    Training and Research Career Development Initiatives  NHGRI continues to support the development of the next generation of genomic researchers.  New programs being planned for FY 2002 are a training initiative in genomics research targeted to under represented minority undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; a career development initiative in genomics research related to health disparities targeted to postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty; and an interdisciplinary ELSI/genetics training initiative.        National Center for Research Resources  (NCRR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Development of Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs)  The MMRRCs are regional facilities coordinated to maintain animals, cryopreserve embryos and gametes, phenotypically characterize animals, assure genetic quality control, and maintain a centralized resource database.  Through the Centers, NCRR will provide mutant mouse resources in response to the rapidly increasing numbers of genetically modified mice created and used by the biomedical research community. Parallel efforts with rats are also envisioned.   Four Centers have been established as well as an Informatics Coordinating Center responsible for electronically linking the MMRRCs and maintaining the database. The extensive planning phase has been completed and operations have begun on a limited basis with a goal of future expansion. This effort will grow markedly over the next few years to meet NIH needs.    Synchrotron Radiation, an Essential Tool for Macromolecular Crystallographers  Synchrotrons are an essential source of x-rays for determining crystallographic structures of biological macromolecules needed to understand the function of proteins and to assist in identifying new targets for therapeutic drug design.  In the post-genomic era, the demand for structures is increasing exponentially.  Through this initiative, the number of synchrotron x-ray stations for collecting biological crystallography data will be doubled by 2003 and, because of rapidly advancing technologies applied to the production of pure proteins, data collection and processing, and structure solution, the capacity of these beamlines to produce new structures is expected to increase by a factor of 10 or more.   The NIH, through NIGMS, NCI and NCRR, ramped up efforts in FY 1999 and FY 2000 to meet these demands by supporting the construction, upgrade of detectors, and operation of state-of-the-art synchrotron beamlines that are accessible and approachable by the user community.    Clinical Research Career Development  This initiative is an effort to increase the number of physicians in a program of mentored patient-oriented research career development (MPORCD).  This should result in an increase in the number of well-trained clinical investigators.  In FY 2000, NCRR reached a new high in the total number of physicians being supported for MPORCD by continuing support for previously funded CAPs (87) and MCAPs (5), and beginning a new program to support K23 awards (42).    Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)  The COBRE program augments and strengthens the institutional biomedical research capabilities in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states by supporting multi-disciplinary centers, led by peer-reviewed, NIH-funded investigators with expertise central to the grant proposal and who mentor promising junior investigators.  This initiative will facilitate the development of new disease specific research Centers and will augment the capability of existing Centers.  Twenty-one Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence have been established at a cost of $36.72 million for the first year.    Future Initiatives       Establish Integrative Biomedical Technology Centers  NCRR plans to support development of technologies to quantitate spatiotemporal differences in the levels of gene expression, assess post-translational modifications of proteins, and characterize intracellular protein-protein interactions in both healthy and diseased states. Initial efforts will concentrate on proteomics.    Establish Regional Genotyping and Phenotyping Centers  With the sequencing of the human genome, technologies for high-throughput approaches to genotyping need to be developed to identify genetic polymorphisms for disease variants.  NCRR will support workshops in bioinformatics, and develop and implement a web-based bioinformatics toolbox for investigators.  Phenotyping resources also need to be established for human and animal studies.  Genotyping and phenotyping data will be included in a common database to reduce unnecessary research duplication.    Instrumentation Exceeding $0.5 Million  Biomedical research depends increasingly on advanced instrumentation that often costs in excess of $0.5 million. Therefore,  NCRR plans to provide support for competitive awards to acquire high-end instrumentation, including very high-field NMR spectrometers, synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular structure studies, high-resolution mass spectrometers, and cryoelectron microscopes.    Establish Islet Cell Resource Centers  A recent study reported that patients with Type I diabetes who received human islet cell transplants attained long-term independence from insulin injections.  To extend and reproduce these observations, NCRR and its partners will establish up to six Islet Cell Resource Centers (ICRCs) for the isolation, purification, characterization, and transplantation of human pancreatic islet cells. The ICRCs will optimize the number of islet cells harvested from pancreatic tissue and optimize conditions for maintaining peak islet cell function.    Construct and Improve Chimpanzee Facilities  Chimpanzees originally bred for AIDS research have thus far not been useful models for studies of AIDS-virus pathogenesis. Thus, a plan was devised to consolidate the animals supported by NIH in a more cost-effective configuration.  To do this, funds to construct or renovate appropriate housing to consolidate the  chimpanzee research sites and separately support the construction of a sanctuary system in order  to assure the well-being and safety of research chimpanzees and their caretakers.    Enhance the Biomedical Research Capacities of Institutions within the IDeA States  The NIH Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program provides support to build the biomedical research capacities of institutions in states that have not previously fully participated in biomedical research through a new component entitled Biomedical Research Infrastructure Networks (BRIN).  BRIN requires activities at community colleges or undergraduate institutions to enhance the quality of undergraduate science faculty.  BRIN will prepare outstanding students for graduate schools in their states where they may pursue biomedical research careers to help upgrade the technical expertise of the state's workforce and improve the local economy.        National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (NCCAM)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003        Chelation Therapy for CAD  This initiative, co-funded by NHLBI, facilitates the study a popular but controversial alternative medical therapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease.  NCCAM's goal is to determine the safety and efficacy of  ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) chelation therapy through the first large, well-controlled, multi-center clinical trial using validated outcome measures.  Formal solicitation for applications is expected this year.    Specialty Research Centers in Cancer  This initiative enhances greatly our research on popular CAM treatments for cancer and its complications.  The long-term goal of the initiative is to expand options for safe and effective cancer therapies.  Grants have been awarded to two leading academic centers.  The Johns Hopkins Center is studying CAM treatments for breast cancer and running the first controlled trial of PC-SPES, a Chinese herbal mixture, in African-American and Chinese men with prostate cancer.  The University of Pennsylvania Center is studying hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen at greater than-atmospheric pressures) for the treatment of head and neck cancers.    Magnesium Therapy for Asthma  This initiative, co-funded by NHLBI,  supports a study of the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium supplementation as a treatment for acute asthma attacks in various age and racial/ethnic groups.  The study is part of an effort to develop new treatment options for severe asthma attacks.  Applications are now being solicited.    Epidemiology of CAM use in Minority Populations  This initiative supports  epidemiological surveys of CAM use in minority and underserved populations, emphasizing the use of traditional and folk medicine among immigrant populations and the rural poor.  NCCAM will use the survey data to help prioritize specific CAM studies in under-served populations.  In collaboration with the CDC, a survey instrument is under development and will be used in the field in 2002.    CAM at the End of Life  NCCAM's activities include the support of exploratory studies of novel approaches to prevent and manage symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and AIDS and their treatment.  The goal is to expand the end-of life options, preserve the dignity, reduce intractable pain and improve the quality of life of terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS patients.  We are currently receiving applications.      Future Initiatives       Botanical Interactions with HIV/AIDS Drugs  NCCAM will investigate interactions between popular herbal supplements and important prescription drugs for HIV/AIDS using animal models and exploratory clinical studies.  The goal is to develop reliable research-based data to guide consumers and practitioners about the potential risks and benefits of simultaneously using botanical products and potentially life-saving medications for HIV/AIDS.     Chromium to treat diabetes  NCCAM expects to solicit applications for clinical studies to explore the safety and efficacy of chromium for treating diabetes in populations at high risk for the disease.    Immunomodulatory effects of CAM  NCCAP plans to support new studies of how various CAM practices such as acupuncture and herbal medicines alter the body's immune responses so as to help prevent or treat infections, arthritis, cancer, or HIV/AIDS.        Fogarty International Center  (FIC)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003     HIV/AIDS  The AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) led by FIC and in partnership with nine NIH institutes, supports research training that is critical to advancing the AIDS research agenda abroad.  For example, with FIC support, investigators at the University of Nairobi collaborating with the University of Washington have evaluated the rates of HIV transmission to infants through breastfeeding.  In the new study, pregnant HIV-infected women joined groups that would either breastfeed or formula feed their infants.  Among infants born to mothers in the breast feeding group the risk of becoming HIV infected in association with breast feeding increased by 76% in contrast to the formula fed group.  Overall, 44 percent of the HIV infections in infants born to mothers in the breastfeeding group were due to breast milk.  This study clearly shows the need to prevent breast milk transmission of HIV and has major implications for development and deployment of public health interventions in resource-poor settings.  Additional studies are now underway to address the related and complex social and economic implications of infant feeding.     Emerging Infectious Diseases  Tuberculosis accounts for one-quarter of all avoidable adult deaths in the developing world.  A major problem in developing countries is their limited capacity to use conventional diagnostic tests because of high costs and equipment demands.  As a result, drug susceptibility testing is rarely performed despite the rapidly rising rates of multiple drug resistant TB strains that can spread, undetected, from person to person s well as across borders.  With FIC support under the ITREID program, U.S. and Peruvian scientists developed a rapid and reliable method for detecting tuberculosis for use by health officers in developing countries. The test, called ""microscopic observation broth-drug susceptibility assay"" (MODS), detects tiny amounts of TB bacteria in patient sputum samples using a simple light microscope within 9 days, compared with 3-4 weeks for traditional culture methods.  This rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive method can also be used to determine drug resistance.  Use of MODS should improve the capability to detect and properly treat tuberculosis including drug resistant mutants in developing country health facilities, thus blocking the spread of this killer infection.    Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award (FIRCA)  Improving the health status of populations at home and abroad requires a continuing commitment to basic science.  The FIRCA provides small research grants to foster international research partnerships between NIH-supported U.S. scientists and their collaborators in regions of the developing world.  Selected FIRCA accomplishments are as follows:       Genetics:  With FIC support, scientists at the University of Washington are collaborating with colleagues at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Bethlehem University in the Palestinian Authority to map and clone the genes responsible for different types of inherited deafness. The incidence of preverbal deafness is high in the Middle East region, and may be due to environmental factors or to mutations in any one of more than 100 genes, each of which codes for a protein involved in the development, structure or function of the inner ear.  This science, pursued through novel studies conducted through novel mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of the biology of hearing and the potential for new interventions to reduce deafness.  Despite political tensions in the region, the U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian cooperation continues undeterred.     Asthma:  An increasingly worrisome trend in the burden of childhood disease is the striking rise in asthma incidence in both industrialized and developing nations, due in part to sensitizing agents in the environment. In efforts to elucidate the physiological conditions that lead to asthma and to develop potential interventions, FIC-supported scientists at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center and the National Autonomous University of Mexico City are defining the pathways in the chain of events that lead to allergic reactions or asthma.  By studying the pathways from allergen binding to the allergic reaction, researchers hope to understand mechanisms that control these events in order to interrupt them.  The team has described a new approach to isolate the allergic reaction-signaling pathway that engages the immune system via mast cells.  Scientists have pinpointed specific target enzymes that act as key players in transmitting the signal to release inflammatory substances that mediate the symptoms of an allergic response.  This knowledge will provide tangible leads for the development of new drugs to block the action of these enzymes and mute or prevent severe and sometimes lethal allergic reactions involved in asthma.         National Library of Medicine  (NLM)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003      Health Information for the Public  The National Library of Medicine formally embarked on a program of providing health information services to the general public beginning in FY 1999.  This change in direction for an institution that traditionally emphasized service to the health professions was made possible by the convergence of two factors: increased access to the Web by consumers and increased resources for the Library available through the effort to double the NIH budget.  MEDLINE, NLM's immense database of science-based medical literature, was made free and easily accessible on the Web in 1997.  The enthusiastic response of the medical community to this valuable resource was predictable; what was not predictable was the heavy use of MEDLINE made by the general public.  This, along with the encouragement of the Congress, prompted the NLM to create MEDLINEplus in FY 1999. MEDLINEplus provides easy access to a wealth of reliable health information written for the public, much of it from the NIH.  The new service has information about more than 400 diseases and health conditions, extensive data on over-the-counter and prescription drugs, medical dictionaries and encyclopedias, and directories of hospitals and providers.  One of the most important services of MEDLINEplus is providing the public and their health care providers with information about more than 5,000 clinical trials sponsored by NIH and others through ClinicalTrials.gov.  Users of MEDLINEplus are ensured total privacy, and usage has climbed to 5 million page hits a month.      Next Generation Internet  With resources made available through Congressional support, over the last two years, the NLM has assumed a key role in ensuring that the health sciences are prepared to take fullest advantage of the benefits of the rapidly expanding global information infrastructure, including telemedicine and the Next Generation Internet.  One aspect of this is NLM's involvement with medical informatics research and training.  A recent report, ""Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative,"" recommends that NIH invest heavily in computer and information technology so as to be able to manage data and model biological processes, and to train the needed specialists.  The BISTI initiative falls within the scope of the NLM's medical informatics training program under which the Library supports 12 training programs at universities across the nation for the express purpose of training experts to carry out research in general informatics and in the genome-related specialty of bioinformatics.  In FY 2000 the NLM was able to augment each of the 12 training programs with a BISTI supplement of $200,000 to strengthen or initiate bioinformatics training within the program.  These awards will allow the training programs to turn the advantages they already enjoy experienced faculty, curricula, sanctioned university status, and ready access to potential candidates to bioinformatics. As part of the NIH BISTI Program, NLM is prepared to fund in FY 2001 several planning grants in this arena.    Genomics  The continuing voyage of discovery into our DNA is one of science's great adventures.  The Library's extensive and rapidly expanding program in medical genomics, the development of tools and approaches to assay gene function, is centered at NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  A new ""Human Gene Map"" was announced in FY 1999 that,  to date, has assisted scientists in identifying more than 100 disease-causing genes. In FY 2000 there was the widely publicized announcement of the completion of a ""working draft"" of the human genome.  Substantial increases in budget and staff for the NCBI have made it possible to keep pace with the enormous amount of data coming out of genome research laboratories around the world and to offer to the public on the Web an assembly of the DNA sequence into an organized and easily accessible resource.  In all, the Center supports and distributes more than 30 databases and research tools for the medical and scientific communities.     Future Initiatives     Permanent Access to a Changing Medical Literature  The basic function of the National Library of Medicine is to collect, organize, and preserve the literature of the health sciences. That literature is published not only on paper, but, increasingly, in various electronic forms.  National institutions with archival responsibilities, such as the NLM, are expected to handle all such material, and to take steps so that it will be available to future generations.  The Library assigns the very highest priority to collecting and preserving information in all forms and to working closely with organizations like the Library of Congress in developing techniques to ensure that today's knowledge — both that which is ""born digital"" and that which is converted from paper to digital form — will not be lost.  With future increases, NLM expects that PubMed Central, a new electronic full-text journal archive available on the Web, will be expanded greatly beginning in FY 2002.  PubMed Central is so-named because of its integration with the existing PubMed retrieval system that was developed by the NLM for biomedical literature databases.   PubMed Central provides permanent free access to full-text articles from journals indexed by one or more of the major abstracting and indexing services.  This is viewed as the initial site in an international system. A PubMed Central advisory committee is headed by Nobelist Joshua Lederberg.    Centers of Excellence Grants/BISTI  Expanded resources are making it possible for the NLM, in FY 2002, to participate with the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI) in funding what are called National Programs of Excellence in Biomedical Computing.  NLM is funding several planning grants in FY 2001 that will make implementing these so-called ""Centers of Excellence"" possible the following year assuming appropriate funding.  The Centers will provide a venue for interdisciplinary research, tool-building, training and education requiring the cooperative efforts of biologists and bioinformaticians.  The Centers are expected to be important sites for training of informatics-literate biologists and of domain-literate informaticians.  We expect that health providers will use in their own clinical setting the new electronic access methods developed and the improved informatics tools devised as a result of work at the Centers of Excellence.    Health Disparities  The NLM has had several programs over the past decade that targeted the need to improve health information services for selected underserved populations. Two examples are improving access to environmental health services information in minority communities and to HIV/AIDS information in communities at risk for that disease.  The Library recently published a Strategic Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, 20002005.  This, plus increased resources, are making it possible for NLM to broaden substantially its assistance for minority populations in the coming years.  Among the areas of special emphasis: implementing a plan, the feasibility of which has already been demonstrated, to install a malaria research network in sub-Saharan Africa; working with institutions around the country (Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, Medical University of South Carolina) to use new information technologies to enable medically underserved diabetes patients to manage their disease and avoid complications; working with Community Health Centers to bring the potential benefits of ClinicalTrials.gov to minority populations; and building on the lessons learned in a pilot project to support Indian reservations and villages in various parts of the U.S. that are currently underserved with regard to Internet connectivity and access to health information."
GX070-24-12319302	"Home News & Announcements Archives (1999-2001) National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells                           National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells        (Effective August 25, 2000, 65 FR 51976)   (Corrected November 21, 2000, 65 FR 69951)         This Federal Register Announcement has been superceded as it pertains to    human embryonic stem cell research. Please refer to the  Federal    Register Announcement .            SUMMARY : The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is hereby publishing final    ""National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent    Stem Cells."" The Guidelines establish procedures to help ensure that NIH-funded    research in this area is conducted in an ethical and legal manner.     EFFECTIVE  DATE : These Guidelines are effective on August 25, 2000. The moratorium on research    using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos and fetal tissue    put in place by the Director, NIH, in January 1999, was lifted on August 25,    2000.     SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS ON DRAFT GUIDELINES :  On December 2, 1999, the    NIH published Draft Guidelines for research involving human pluripotent stem    cells (hPSCs) in the  Federal Register  for public comment. The comment period    ended on February 22, 2000.    The NIH received approximately 50,000 comments from    members of Congress, patient advocacy groups, scientific societies, religious    organizations, and private citizens. This Notice presents the final Guidelines    together with NIH's response to the substantive public comments that addressed    provisions of the Guidelines.     Scope of Guidelines and General Issues      Respondents    asked for clarification of terminology used in the Guidelines and some commented    that the language was not appropriate or was too technical, particularly the    informed consent sections . The NIH agrees that these Guidelines should be clear    and understandable. Changes, including some reorganization of the sections,    were made to this end. The Guidelines are written primarily for the purpose    of informing investigators of the conditions that must be met in order to receive    NIH funding for research using hPSCs and, therefore, some technical language    is required. The Guidelines do not define the precise language that should appear    in informed consent documents because these should be developed by the investigator/clinician    specifically for a particular study protocol or procedure for which the consent    is being sought. Existing regulatory provisions require (45 CFR  46.116) that    the language in informed consent documents be understandable to prospective    participants in the study.     Respondents suggested that NIH funding for research    using hPSCs would be in violation of the DHHS appropriations law and that derivation    of hPSCs cannot be distinguished from their use. For this reason, a number of    respondents asked that the NIH withdraw the draft Guidelines . The NIH sought    the opinion of the DHHS General Counsel, who determined that ""federally funded    research that utilizes hPSCs would not be prohibited by the HHS appropriations    law prohibiting human embryo research, because such cells are not human embryos.""    Comments questioning this conclusion did not present information or arguments    that justify reconsideration of the conclusion.     Respondents commented that the    Guidelines are too restrictive or that there is no need for Federal Guidelines    for this arena of research. Comments asserted that federally funded research    using hPSCs should go forward without formal requirements, in the same manner    as in the private sector . In order to help ensure that the NIH-funded research    using hPSCs is conducted in an ethical and legal manner, the NIH felt it was    advisable to develop and implement guidelines. To this end, the NIH Director    convened a Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH (ACD),    to advise the ACD on the development of guidelines and an oversight process    for research involving hPSCs. The NIH Director charged the Working Group with    developing appropriate guidelines to govern research involving the derivation    and use of hPSCs from fetal tissue and research involving the use of hPSCs derived    from human embryos that are in excess of clinical need.     Respondents commented    regarding the sources of stem cells. Some respondents stated that research on    hPSCs was unnecessary because stem cells from adults, umbilical cords, and placentas    could be used instead. Other respondents asked the NIH to restrict Federal funding    for hPSC research to those cells derived from fetal and adult tissue but not    embryos. Other respondents asked that the Guidelines encompass research using    stem cells from adult tissues . As stated under Section I. Scope of Guidelines,    the Guidelines apply to the use of NIH funds for research using hPSCs derived    from human embryos or human fetal tissue. The Guidelines do not impose requirements    on Federal funding of research involving stem cells from human adults, umbilical    cords, or placentas.   Given the enormous potential of stem cells to the development    of new therapies for the most devastating diseases, it is important to simultaneously    pursue all lines of promising research. It is possible that no single source    of stem cells is best or even suitable/usable for all therapies. Different types    or sources of stem cells may be optimal for treatment of specific conditions.    In order to determine the very best source of many of the specialized cells    and tissues of the body for new treatments and even cures, it is vitally important    to study the potential of adult stem cells for comparison to that of hPSCs derived    from embryos and fetuses. Unless all stem cell types are studied, the differences    between adult stem cells and embryo and fetal-derived hPSCs will not be known.      Moreover, there is evidence that adult stem cells may have more limited potential    than hPSCs. First, stem cells for all cell and tissue types have not yet been    found in the adult human. Significantly, cardiac stem cells or pancreatic islet    stem cells have not been identified in adult humans. Second, stem cells in adults    are often present in only minute quantities, are difficult to isolate and purify,    and their numbers may decrease with age. For example, brain cells from adults    that may be neural stem cells have been obtained only by removing a portion    of the brain of an adult with epilepsy, a complex and invasive procedure that    carries the added risk of further neurological damage. Any attempt to use stem    cells from a patient's own body for treatment would require that stem cells    would first have to be isolated from the patient and then grown in culture in    sufficient numbers to obtain adequate quantities for treatment. This would mean    that for some rapidly progressing disorders, there may not be sufficient time    to grow enough cells to use for treatment. Third, in disorders that are caused    by a genetic defect, the genetic error likely would be present in the patient's    stem cells, making cells from such a patient inappropriate for transplantation.    In addition, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities caused by exposure    to daily living, including sunlight, toxins, and errors made during DNA replication    than will be found in fetal or embryonic hPSCs. Fourth, there is evidence that    stem cells from adults may not have the same capacity to multiply as do younger    cells. These potential weaknesses may limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.       Respondents were concerned that these are guidelines and not requirements or    regulations . Although these are guidelines and not regulations, they prescribe    the documentation and assurances that must accompany requests for NIH funding    for research utilizing hPSCs. If the funding requests do not contain the prescribed    information, funding for hPSC research will not be provided. Compliance with    the Guidelines will be imposed as a condition of grant award.     Respondents commented    that there had not been enough widespread public disclosure/discussion of this    research or the Guidelines . Prior to the development of draft Guidelines, there    were two Congressional hearings on hPSCs. In a further effort to ensure substantial    discussion and comment, the NIH convened a Working Group of the Advisory Committee    to the Director, NIH (ACD), to advise the ACD on the development of these Guidelines.    The Working Group was composed of scientists, patients and patient advocates,    ethicists, clinicians, and lawyers. The Working Group met in public session    on April 8, 1999, and heard from members of the public, as well as professional    associations and Congress. In developing the draft Guidelines, the NIH also    considered advice from the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC). Draft    Guidelines were published for public comment in the  Federal Register  on December    2, 1999, for 60 days, and, in response to public interest, the comment period    was extended an additional 28 days. Approximately 50,000 comments were received.    NIH issued a national press release announcing the  Federal Register  notice and    many of the Nation's newspapers carried articles on this area of research and    on the Guidelines. Patient groups, scientific societies, and religious organizations    convened meetings and discussion groups and disseminated materials about this    area of research and about the Guidelines.     Comment was received about whether    the Guidelines apply to hPSC lines developed outside of the United States . The    Guidelines make no distinction based upon the country in which an hPSC line    is developed. All lines to be used in hPSC cell research funded by NIH must    meet the same requirements.     Derivation and Use of hPSCs From Fetal Tissue      Respondents    made the point that the NIH has specified certain requirements for the use of    human fetal tissue to derive hPSCs in addition to those imposed on other areas    of human fetal tissue research. These respondents suggested that the section    of the Guidelines pertaining to fetal tissue sources be omitted . In order to    ensure uniformity in NIH's oversight of research using hPSCs, the Guidelines    were extended to govern hPSCs derived from both human embryos and fetal tissue.       Use of hPSCs Derived From Human Embryos      Respondents suggested that the Guidelines    refer to ""fertility treatment"" rather than to ""infertility treatment"" in order    to clarify that they allow the use of human embryos from treatments that employ    assisted reproductive technologies to facilitate reproduction in fertile, as    well as in infertile, individuals . The Guidelines have been changed accordingly.      Respondents suggested dropping the word ""early"" throughout the document or more    clearly defining ""early.""  The word ""early"" in reference to human embryos has    been deleted; the Guidelines make it clear that NIH funding of research using    hPSCs derived in the private sector from human embryos can involve only embryos    that have not reached the stage at which the mesoderm is formed.     Some respondents    were concerned that embryos might be created for research purposes. Other respondents    stated there should be no distinction between embryos created for research purposes    and those created for fertility treatment . Investigators seeking NIH funds for    research using hPSCs are required to provide documentation, prior to the award    of any NIH funds, that embryos were created for the purposes of fertility treatment.    President Clinton, many members of Congress, the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel,    and the NBAC have all embraced the distinction between embryos created for research    purposes and those created for reproductive purposes.     Respondents were concerned    about the creation of a ""black market"" for human embryos, and expressed concerns    that individuals will be coerced into donating embryos . The Guidelines state    that there can be no incentives for donation and that a decision to donate must    be made free of coercion. In addition, the Guidelines set forth conditions that    will help ensure all donations are voluntary. For example, with regard to hPSCs    derived from embryos, research using Federal funds may only be conducted if    the cells were derived from frozen embryos that were created for the purpose    of fertility treatment and that were in excess of clinical need.     Respondents    commented on the requirement that human embryos be frozen in order to qualify    for derivation of hPSCs to be used in NIH-funded research. Respondents suggested    that the freezing requirement would preclude the use of hPSCs derived from embryos    that are genetically and chromosomally abnormal, since such embryos are usually    not frozen for reproductive purposes . While the NIH acknowledges that research    on hPSCs derived from such embryos could yield important scientific information,    limiting research to hPSCs derived from frozen human embryos will help ensure    that the decision to donate the embryo for hPSC research is distinct and separate    from the fertility treatment.     Financial Issues      Respondents expressed concern    regarding the sale of fetal tissue for profit and whether hPSC research would    encourage such activity. Respondents also were concerned about whether clinics    or doctors would profit from the derivation of hPSCs and/or their sale . Section    498B of the Public Health Service Act prohibits any individual from knowingly    acquiring or selling human fetal tissue for ""valuable consideration."" In addition,    the Guidelines prohibit any inducement for the donation of human embryos for    research purposes. The Guidelines also call for an assurance that the hPSCs    to be used in NIH-funded research were obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the hPSCs. All grantees    must sign an assurance that they are in compliance with all applicable Federal,    State, and local laws. Each funded research institution is responsible for monitoring    compliance by individual investigators with any such applicable laws.     Respondents    questioned the prohibition against embryo donors benefitting financially from    their donation . This clause was retained in the final Guidelines to help ensure    that the donating individuals are offered no inducements to donate and that    all donations are voluntary.     Respondents suggested that the Guidelines be strengthened    to include a waiver of intellectual property rights . This proposed change would    be inconsistent with 45 CFR  46.116 of the regulation for the protection of    human subjects of research, which provides that no informed consent may include    language through which the subject waives or appears to waive any of the subject's    legal rights.     Respondents questioned the reference in the requirements for informed    consent related to the commercial potential of donated material . The paragraphs    providing for disclosure in the informed consent of the possibility that the    donated material could have commercial potential were modified. The reference    in these paragraphs to ""donated material"" did not accurately reflect the intent    of the provision. The Guidelines now make clear that the ""results of research    on the human pluripotent stem cells may have commercial potential.""     Ineligible Research      Respondents objected to the areas of research that the NIH has deemed    ineligible, particularly research that is not restricted by statute or regulation,    such as research utilizing hPSCs that were derived using somatic cell nuclear    transfer, i.e., the transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus into a human egg .    The NIH determined that, at this time, research using hPSCs derived from such    sources has not received adequate discussion and consideration by the public    and is, therefore, ineligible for NIH funding.     Separation of Fertility Treatment   and Abortion From Research     Respondents were concerned that hPSC research would    encourage abortion . The law and the Guidelines guard against encouraging abortion    by requiring that the decision to have an abortion be made apart from and prior    to the decision to donate tissue.     Respondents objected to the condition in the    Guidelines that the fertility physician could not be the same person as the    researcher deriving stem cells. Some respondents stated that the Institutional    Review Board (IRB) or an independent physician would be able to guard against    this conflict of interest . The restriction was designed so that the person treating    the individuals seeking fertility treatment, who is involved in decisions such    as how many embryos to produce, is not the person seeking to derive hPSCs. This    separation will help ensure that embryos will not be created in numbers greater    than necessary for fertility treatment    Respondents suggested that the clauses    regarding donation of fetal tissue or human embryos for derivation of stem cells    for eventual use in transplantation be changed explicitly to prevent directed    donation . This change has been made.     Identifiers      Respondents were concerned    about removing identifiers. There was concern that the investigator would not    be able to document compliance with the Guidelines requirements without identifiers,    or that the removal of identifiers would make it impossible to conduct certain    genetic studies or develop therapeutic materials . The Guidelines have been modified    to clarify that the term ""identifier"" refers to any information from which the    donor(s) can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the donors.    However, since information identifying the donor(s) may be necessary if the    tissue or cells are to be used in transplantation, the Guidelines have also    been modified to state that the informed consent should notify donor(s) whether    or not identifiers will be retained.    Respondents commented that DNA is an identifier    and that all donors of human embryos or fetal tissue should be told that identifiers    such as DNA will be retained with the samples . Although DNA can be used to determine    the individual from whom a tissue sample was taken, this can be done only when    one has a sample from both the tissue in question and the putative donor; it    cannot be used to identify an individual out of a population. Moreover, it is    difficult to identify a donor using tissue derived from a fetus or embryo, since    the tissue is not genetically identical to the donor.     Informed Consent and IRB  Review      Respondents asked why investigators were expected to provide documentation    of IRB review of derivation from human embryos, but not for derivation from    fetal tissue. Respondents suggested that the requirements be changed so that    protocols for both sources of hPSCs must be approved by an IRB . The Guidelines    have been changed to make clear that the IRB review requirements regarding the    derivation of cells from fetal tissue and human embryos are the same.     Comment    was received expressing concern that the informed consent explicitly state that    the donor will have no dispositional authority over derived pluripotent stem    cells . The Guidelines state that donation of human embryos should have been    made without any restriction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipient    of the cells derived from the hPSCs for transplantation. Such a statement is    consistent with the statutory provision applicable to the donor informed consent    for the use of fetal tissue for transplantation. The Guidelines now provide    for the inclusion of a statement to this effect in the informed consent.     Respondents    urged that the Guidelines be revised to remove the prohibition on potential    donors receiving information regarding subsequent testing of donated tissue    in the situation when physicians deem disclosure to be in the donors' best interest .    This change has been made.     Respondents requested clarification regarding the    persons from whom consent for donation of embryos for research must be obtained .    The Guidelines call for informed consent from individual(s) who have sought    fertility treatment. Only the individual(s) who were part of the decision to    create the embryo for reproductive purposes should have been part of the decision    to donate for the derivation of hPSCs.     Respondents urged that fertility clinics    should be able to discuss with patients the option of donating embryos for research    at the beginning of the IVF process . The Guidelines do not delineate the timeframe    during which the general option of donating embryos for research can be discussed.    However, according to the Guidelines, obtaining consent for donation of embryos    for the purpose of deriving hPSCs should not occur until after the embryos are    determined to be in ""excess of clinical need.""     Oversight      Respondents stated    that the NIH's oversight in this area of research was very important to the    legal and ethical conduct of this research, and asked for more information regarding    the oversight process . Information about the operations of the Human Pluripotent    Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) can be found in the final Guidelines and on    the NIH Web page.     Respondents were concerned about whether and how NIH would    monitor research after a researcher receives NIH funds . Compliance with the    Guidelines will be largely determined prior to the award of funds. Follow-up    to ensure continued compliance with the Guidelines will be conducted in the    same manner as for all other conditions of all other NIH grant awards. It is    the responsibility of the investigator to file progress reports, and it is the    responsibility of the funded institution to ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines.    NIH staff will also monitor the progress of these investigators as part of their    regular duties.     Respondents asked about penalties for not following the Guidelines .    The following actions may be taken by the NIH when there is a failure to comply    with the terms and conditions of any award: 1) Under 45 CFR  74.14, the NIH    can impose special conditions on an award, including increased oversight/monitoring/reporting    requirements for an institution, project or investigator; 2) Under 45 CFR     74.62, if a grantee materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions    of the award, the NIH may withhold funds pending correction of the problem or,    pending more severe enforcement action, disallow all or part of the costs of    the activity that was not in compliance, withhold further awards for the project,    or suspend or terminate all or part of the funding for the project. Individuals    and institutions may be debarred from eligibility for all Federal financial    assistance and contracts under 45 CFR Part 76 and 48 CFR Subpart 9.4, respectively.    Because these sanctions pertain to all conditions of grant award, the NIH did    not reiterate them in the Guidelines.     Respondents suggested that the HPSCRG    hold periodic Stem Cell Policy Conferences (similar to the Gene Therapy Policy    Conferences conducted by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)) in order    to solicit and consider public comment from interested parties on the scientific,    medical, legal, and ethical issues arising from stem cell research . Members    of the HPSCRG will serve as a resource for recommending to the NIH any need    for Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Policy Conferences.     Other Changes    Because compliance    materials may be made public prior to funding decisions, we have added a sentence    requiring the principal investigator's written consent to the disclosure of    such material necessary to carry out public review and other oversight procedures.      The draft Guidelines required HPSCRG review of proposals from investigators    planning to derive hPSCs from fetal tissue. Because the Guidelines address proposals    for NIH funding for the use of hPSCs, this requirement has been removed from    the Guidelines.    The text of the Guidelines follows.     National Institutes of Health  Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells     I. Scope of Guidelines       These Guidelines apply to the expenditure of National Institutes of Health (NIH)    funds for research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos    (technically known as human embryonic stem cells) or human fetal tissue (technically    known as human embryonic germ cells). For purposes of these Guidelines, ""human    pluripotent stem cells"" are cells that are self-replicating, are derived from    human embryos or human fetal tissue, and are known to develop into cells and    tissues of the three primary germ layers. Although human pluripotent stem cells    may be derived from embryos or fetal tissue, such stem cells are not themselves    embryos. NIH research funded under these Guidelines will involve human pluripotent    stem cells derived 1) from human fetal tissue; or 2) from human embryos that    are the result of  in vitro  fertilization, are in excess of clinical need, and    have not reached the stage at which the mesoderm is formed.   In accordance with    42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  52.4, these Guidelines prescribe the    documentation and assurances that must accompany requests for NIH funding for    research using human pluripotent stem cells from: (1) awardees who want to use    existing funds; (2) awardees requesting an administrative or competing supplement;    and (3) applicants or intramural researchers submitting applications or proposals.    NIH funds may be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from fetal tissue.    NIH funds may not be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from human    embryos. These Guidelines also designate certain areas of human pluripotent    stem cell research as ineligible for NIH funding.     II. Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells that is Eligible for NIH Funding       A. Utilization  of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Human Embryos     1. Submission to  NIH    Intramural or extramural investigators who are intending to use existing    funds, are requesting an administrative supplement, or are applying for new    NIH funding for research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human    embryos must submit to NIH the following:     a. An assurance signed by the responsible    institutional official that the pluripotent stem cells were derived from human    embryos in accordance with the conditions set forth in Section II.A.2 of these    Guidelines and that the institution will maintain documentation in support of    the assurance;    b. A sample informed consent document (with patient identifier    information removed) and a description of the informed consent process that    meet the criteria for informed consent set forth in Section II.A.2.e of these    Guidelines;    c. An abstract of the scientific protocol used to derive human pluripotent    stem cells from an embryo;   d. Documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB)    approval of the derivation protocol;    e. An assurance that the stem cells to    be used in the research were or will be obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the stem cells;    f.  The title of the research proposal or specific subproject that proposes the    use of human pluripotent stem cells;   g. An assurance that the proposed research    using human pluripotent stem cells is not a class of research that is ineligible    for NIH funding as set forth in Section III of these Guidelines; and   h. The    Principal Investigator's written consent to the disclosure of all material submitted    under Paragraph A.1 of this Section, as necessary to carry out the public review    and other oversight procedures set forth in Section IV of these Guidelines.       2. Conditions for the Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived From    Human Embryos    Studies utilizing pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos    may be conducted using NIH funds only if the cells were derived (without Federal    funds) from human embryos that were created for the purposes of fertility treatment    and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment.       a. To ensure that the donation of human embryos in excess of the clinical need    is voluntary, no inducements, monetary or otherwise, should have been offered    for the donation of human embryos for research purposes. Fertility clinics and/or    their affiliated laboratories should have implemented specific written policies    and practices to ensure that no such inducements are made available.    b. There    should have been a clear separation between the decision to create embryos for    fertility treatment and the decision to donate human embryos in excess of clinical    need for research purposes to derive pluripotent stem cells. Decisions related    to the creation of embryos for fertility treatment should have been made free    from the influence of researchers or investigators proposing to derive or utilize    human pluripotent stem cells in research. To this end, the attending physician    responsible for the fertility treatment and the researcher or investigator deriving    and/or proposing to utilize human pluripotent stem cells should not have been    one and the same person.    c. To ensure that human embryos donated for research    were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking fertility treatment    and to allow potential donors time between the creation of the embryos for fertility    treatment and the decision to donate for research purposes, only frozen human    embryos should have been used to derive human pluripotent stem cells. In addition,    individuals undergoing fertility treatment should have been approached about    consent for donation of human embryos to derive pluripotent stem cells only    at the time of deciding the disposition of embryos in excess of the clinical    need.    d. Donation of human embryos should have been made without any restriction    or direction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipients of transplantation    of the cells derived from the embryo.    e. Informed Consent Informed consent should    have been obtained from individuals who have sought fertility treatment and    who elect to donate human embryos in excess of clinical need for human pluripotent    stem cell research purposes. The informed consent process should have included    discussion of the following information with potential donors, pertinent to    making the decision whether or not to donate their embryos for research purposes.      Informed consent should have included:    (i) A statement that the embryos will    be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells for research that may include    human transplantation research;    (ii) A statement that the donation is made without    any restriction or direction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipient(s)    of transplantation of the cells derived from the embryo;    (iii) A statement as    to whether or not information that could identify the donors of the embryos,    directly or through identifiers linked to the donors, will be removed prior    to the derivation or the use of human pluripotent stem cells;    (iv) A statement    that derived cells and/or cell lines may be kept for many years;    (v) Disclosure    of the possibility that the results of research on the human pluripotent stem    cells may have commercial potential, and a statement that the donor will not    receive financial or any other benefits from any such future commercial development;      (vi) A statement that the research is not intended to provide direct medical    benefit to the donor; and    (vii) A statement that embryos donated will not be    transferred to a woman's uterus and will not survive the human pluripotent stem    cell derivation process.    f. Derivation protocols should have been approved by    an IRB established in accord with 45 CFR  46.107 and  46.108 or FDA regulations    at 21 CFR  56.107 and  56.108.    B. Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells  Derived From Human Fetal Tissue     1. Submission to NIH    Intramural or extramural    investigators who are intending to use existing funds, are requesting an administrative    supplement, or are applying for new NIH funding for research using human pluripotent    stem cells derived from fetal tissue must submit to NIH the following:     a. An    assurance signed by the responsible institutional official that the pluripotent    stem cells were derived from human fetal tissue in accordance with the conditions    set forth in Section II.B.2 of these Guidelines and that the institution will    maintain documentation in support of the assurance;    b. A sample informed consent    document (with patient identifier information removed) and a description of    the informed consent process that meet the criteria for informed consent set    forth in Section II.B.2.b of these Guidelines;    c. An abstract of the scientific    protocol used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from fetal tissue;    d. Documentation    of IRB approval of the derivation protocol;    e. An assurance that the stem cells    to be used in the research were or will be obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the stem cells;    f.  The title of the research proposal or specific subproject that proposes the    use of human pluripotent stem cells;   g. An assurance that the proposed research    using human pluripotent stem cells is not a class of research that is ineligible    for NIH funding as set forth in Section III of these Guidelines; and    h. The    Principal Investigator's written consent to the disclosure of all material submitted    under Paragraph B.1 of this Section, as necessary to carry out the public review    and other oversight procedures set forth in Section IV of these Guidelines.       2. Conditions for the Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived From    Fetal Tissue     a. Unlike pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos, DHHS    funds may be used to support research to derive pluripotent stem cells from    fetal tissue, as well as for research utilizing such cells. Such research is    governed by Federal statutory restrictions regarding fetal tissue research at     42 U.S.C.  289g-2(a)  and the Federal regulations at  45 CFR  46.210 . In addition,    because cells derived from fetal tissue at the early stages of investigation    may, at a later date, be used in human fetal tissue transplantation research,    it is the policy of NIH to require that all NIH-funded research involving the    derivation or utilization of pluripotent stem cells from human fetal tissue    also comply with the fetal tissue transplantation research statute at  42 U.S.C.     289g-1  and with  42 U.S.C.  289g-2(b) .    b. Informed Consent    As a policy matter,    NIH-funded research deriving or utilizing human pluripotent stem cells from    fetal tissue should comply with the informed consent law applicable to fetal    tissue transplantation research (42 U.S.C.  289g-1) and the following conditions.    The informed consent process should have included discussion of the following    information with potential donors, pertinent to making the decision whether    to donate fetal tissue for research purposes.    Informed consent should have included:       (i) A statement that fetal tissue will be used to derive human pluripotent stem    cells for research that may include human transplantation research;    (ii) A statement    that the donation is made without any restriction or direction regarding the    individual(s) who may be the recipient(s) of transplantation of the cells derived    from the fetal tissue;    (iii) A statement as to whether or not information that    could identify the donors of the fetal tissue, directly or through identifiers    linked to the donors, will be removed prior to the derivation or the use of    human pluripotent stem cells;    (iv) A statement that derived cells and/or cell    lines may be kept for many years;    (v) Disclosure of the possibility that the    results of research on the human pluripotent stem cells may have commercial    potential, and a statement that the donor will not receive financial or any    other benefits from any such future commercial development; and    (vi) A statement    that the research is not intended to provide direct medical benefit to the donor.         c. Derivation protocols should have been approved by an IRB established in accord    with 45 CFR  46.107 and  46.108 or FDA regulations at 21 CFR  56.107 and     56.108      III. Areas of Research Involving Human Pluripotent Stem Cells that    are Ineligible for NIH Funding     Areas of research ineligible for NIH funding    include:     A. The derivation of pluripotent stem cells from human embryos;    B.  Research in which human pluripotent stem cells are utilized to create or contribute    to a human embryo;    C. Research utilizing pluripotent stem cells that were derived    from human embryos created for research purposes, rather than for fertility    treatment;    D. Research in which human pluripotent stem cells are derived using    somatic cell nuclear transfer, i.e., the transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus    into a human or animal egg;    E. Research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells    that were derived using somatic cell nuclear transfer, i.e., the transfer of    a human somatic cell nucleus into a human or animal egg;    F. Research in which    human pluripotent stem cells are combined with an animal embryo; and    G. Research    in which human pluripotent stem cells are used in combination with somatic cell    nuclear transfer for the purposes of reproductive cloning of a human.       IV. Oversight        A. The NIH Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) will review documentation    of compliance with the Guidelines for funding requests that propose the use    of human pluripotent stem cells. This working group will hold public meetings    when a funding request proposes the use of a line of human pluripotent stem    cells that has not been previously reviewed and approved by the HPSCRG.    B. In    the case of new or competing continuation (renewal) or competing supplement    applications, all documentation of compliance with the Guidelines will be reviewed    by HPSCRG and all applications will be reviewed for scientific merit by a Scientific    Review Group. In the case of requests to use existing funds or applications    for an administrative supplement or in the case of intramural proposals, Institute    or Center staff should forward material to the HPSCRG for review and determination    of compliance with the Guidelines prior to allowing the research to proceed.      C. The NIH will compile a yearly report that will include the number of applications    and proposals reviewed and the titles of all awarded applications, supplements    or administrative approvals for the use of existing funds, and intramural projects.

At the same time, reports of previously unknown and unexpected                multipotent or stem cells in various tissues of children and adults                has produced enormous interest also in so-called adult stem cells,                with similar promise, and to be frank, also more than a little hype.                              By almost all accounts we stand today in the infancy, not to say                embryonic, stage of these researches, and it is surely too early                to answer the questions that the layman wants answered.  How soon,                for which of our diseases, from what sort of cells, at what cost,                and at what risk will the cure be available?                  Yet it is not too early to learn where we are in fact in this                rapidly growing field, to try to separate fact from fiction, true                promise from hype.  And to do this we have gone to the experts,                commissioning review essays, essays that would review for us the                published literature over the past two years since the August 2001                decision, covering work in five areas according to the origin of                the cells.  ""Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"" a paper by Tenneille                Ludwig and James Thomson, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,""                a paper from John Gearhart, a paper on cloned embryonic stem cells,                a paper by Rudolph Jaenisch, a review of the adult stem cell research,                a paper from David Prentice, and an update on the work with her                own multipotent adult progenitor cells from Catherine Verfaillie.                 The papers have been sent out with the briefing books, and I assume                that they've been read.  We are thinking about another paper                on mesenchymal stem cells.                  We're very fortunate and grateful to have with us this afternoon                three of the authors, Dr. John Gearhart, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, and                Dr. David Prentice, who will, in brief presentations, highlight                their own papers, after which we will have questions and discussion.                               I would remind Council members that the purpose of this session                is wholly scientific.  We want to learn as much as we can about                the current and projected state of this research.  This isn't                the time for ongoing ethical arguments about the moral status of                the embryo, the research imperative, or equal access for the current                funding policy, important though these issues are.  And I will simply                say I'll use the authority of the Chair to see to it that we                try to stay on the topic.                 Dr. Gearhart has kindly agreed, by the way, to field questions                pertinent to the review essay submitted by Drs. Ludwig and Thomson.                 Gentlemen, welcome to you all.  Thank you for your papers, your                presence, and in advance for your presentation and participation.                 And we will proceed in alphabetical order with John Gearhart first.                               DR. GEARHART:   Well, I can't say I'm delighted                to be back, but I'm happy to be back.  And to not really dwell                on the research that's going on specifically in our laboratory,                but to give you a bit of a general overview of where the work is                in this field, and I think there will be ample opportunity from                some of the things that I say that you can ask questions about it.                              I think the first question, and judging from some of the morning                topics, that I would like to address is the one before you now,                which is, why study these cells?  And what we have heard most frequently                are the issues, well, this is going to be the most versatile source                of cells for promised cell-based interventions for various therapies.                               But I came at this at a different angle.  I am an embryologist                by training.  I've been a student of human embryology for 28                years.  And I'm extremely interested in knowing how we are put                together.  What are the events, what are the mechanisms that lead                to the formation of the human being?                And over time, as you can imagine, we've studied fruit flies,                we've studied mice, we've studied rhesus monkeys.  And I                think one of the major, and perhaps the most important bit of information                that we're going to get out of embryonic stem cells are going                to be the issue of how we are formed.  And this is going to involve                cell biology, genetics, on and on and on.  But this is what is going                to enable us.  And I think with this information, which at the moment                is under the heading of Fundamental Science, or Fundamental Discovery                in Basic Science, this, I think, is going to be the lasting contribution                of studies from embryonic stem cells.                 They're going to have applications, obviously, with that information,                and the sources of cells.  And we're going to apply those to                birth defects.  We're going to apply it to injuries and disease,                because many of the processes are similar.  And we're going                to be able to draw on that information in trying to correct diseases                and injuries.                 True, I think out of this we're going to get sources of cells                which, in the short term, are going to be used directly for the                cell-based interventions.  And I think through the use of these                cells, we're going to discover other important things about                these cells, and some in our research we've learned, which we                can apply in therapies.                 But I want to emphasize one point, and this is my belief, that                this period of time that we're going through in studying embryonic                stem cells is going to be transient.  And I want to emphasize that                I believe it's the information we're going to get out of                these cells that are going to be used in the longer term to restore                function, to regenerate tissues within the bodies of patients, without                the use of these cells.  And that to me, as I look downstream, is                going to be the most important outcome of this research.                 Now I realize that this quote is taken out of context for these                essays that were written, and what was being questioned here.  But                I want to make some comments which are important when we consider                the use of human embryonic stem cells directly.  And that is, we                are finding enormous differences between mouse embryonic stem cells                and human embryonic stem cells, not only in practical issues within                the laboratory from the standpoint of cell cycle times, et cetera,                but also, as we begin to differentiate these cells in a dish, we                find some very subtle and some very not so subtle differences between                the mouse cells and the human cells to get us to the differentiated                functional tissue that we need.                 So I do believe it's time that we work directly on the human                embryonic stem cells if we want to gain this information on embryogenesis,                and if we want to move forward with developing cell-based interventions.                              So, the sources that we're going to talk about in general                deal with this very early stage here derived from the IVF-donated                embryos, and from tissues collected within the early stage of fetal                development, the germ cells.  These cells have many things in common,                and we've published on this.  You've seen this, probably.                 And so we look at them as a group.                  There's a third member of this group, which is embryonal carcinoma                cell, depicted here on the right, which has very similar properties                to these two other cell types.  In fact, it's the only cell                type from which any cell has been derived that's being used                in a pre-clinical trial.  And this is on stroke patients at the                University of Pittsburgh.                 I want to spend time now, or my brief time, on three slides to                give you an indication of where the human work is on this class                of cells.  What are the questions that are being asked, where are                we on some of this stuff, et cetera?                So here now are issues around human embryonic stem cells, or embryonic                germ cells.  One of the first questions that's being asked about                the stem cell itself is what is meant by ""stemness""?                 And obviously this, at the molecular level, gets us into genomics,                proteomics.  And so there is a major effort around the world at                trying to determine the genetic basis of a stem cell.  And the human                cells are being used extensively for this purpose.  How many genes                are involved, what genes are involved, what signaling pathways,                on and on and on.  So stemness is an important issue within this                research.                 Now, it's a comparative thing.  We can do it also with mouse                cells.  We can do it with adult cells as well, trying to find commonality.                 What is it that makes a cell a stem cell?  That information will                be vital, I believe, in the future, in converting virtually any                cell to a stem cell, if we want to go that route.                 The second major issue currently are characterizations of existing                lines.  As you may know, there's no standardization within the                field as to what constitutes a human embryonic stem cell.  We talk                about developmental potential.  We talk about molecular markers,                biochemical/antigenic markers, this is now being taken up by an                international committee under the auspices of the MRC in London                to try to get an agreement on these issues from stem cells around                the world, human embryonic stem cells around the world.                 There's also the issue now of whether or not we should be                deriving new stem cell lines.  And in many countries, this is indeed                happening.  There are a number of new cell lines coming online.                 And what is the importance of this?  Now, many of you have heard                at least from what the Europeans refer to as the presidential cell                lines, those that are eligible for funding in this country.  Should                we have cells that are only grown on human feeder layers?  Most                of the cell lines that have been derived are on mouse feeder layers,                and there is a concern about infectious agents passing into the                human cells.                  I think there's a misconception out there that these lines                will be ineligible for any kind of therapeutic use.  I think the                FDA has made it very clear that they're certainly willing to                consider those grown on mouse feeder layers if they meet certain                criteria to also be eligible for use in the clinic.                  But there are a number of lines now that have been derived on                human feeder layers, and there are lines being derived that are                feeder layer independent, which means it makes it much easier to                work with in the laboratory.  You don't have to worry about                these other cells that are present in your cultures.                  And there's an attempt now being made to derive these lines                in defined media, which means there are no other animal products,                no serum, that you can control very carefully the differentiation                of these cells by adding specific growth factors in a sequential                fashion.                 The most important element to this, though, is this top line here.                 Many of you may not realize it, but when we say that routinely three                or four different mouse embryonic stem cell lines have been used                for the last 20-some years, what's the problem here, why can't                we use just a few of the human.  Those lines have been selected                from a hundred and some cell lines that were made as to being the                best cell lines to use for those purposes.  And so I think we're                still in this phase of trying to determine what are really the good                cell lines, human embryonic stem cell lines that are available.                 And thus the issue of generating more.                 For the use of these lines, emphasis in the lab now is in the                following area.  We're trying to work up high-efficiency differentiation                protocols that result in homogenous cell populations of functional                cell types.  That is, can we in the laboratory come up with protocols,                growth conditions, that are going to get us 10 million dopaminergic                neurons, and only dopaminergic neurons?  Most of the protocols we                have now result in a mixture of cell types within a dish, and we                go in and select out the ones we want.                 So there's concern about the heterogeneity of the cells, and                the fact that we can't at this point have a high efficiency                in getting the cell types we need.  We manipulate the growth environments,                and we manipulate the cells genetically to accomplish this goal.                              Once we differentiate these cells, and we've had some success                in certain pathways which we can talk about, we are very concerned                about what we refer to as the authenticity of the derived cells.                 That is, is the dopaminergic neuron you've formed, the insulin-producing                cell you've formed, the cholinergic neuron, the cardiac muscle,                are these actually functional cells that are the equivalent of those                that you normally find in the adult?                  So a great deal of effort, both in the dish,  in vitro ,                is being made in different parameters to measure whether or not                these are authentic cells.  There are many protocols, as you can                imagine, that lead to cells that look like something, but they're                not functional.  And this is a major concern.  The other side of                this is, the golden test is can you transplant these cells into                an animal model of some kind and see that they assume the function                that you're hoping that they would.                  But again, these are human cells going into rodents, primarily.                 Do we have every reason to believe that they're going to function                appropriately?  We don't know that yet.  We're also putting                cells into non-human primates to get that kind of a measure as well.                              We are in the laboratory contrasting and comparing among various                sources of stem cells.  In our laboratory, we work on human ES,                human EG, umbilical cord blood, et cetera.  And the importance of                this is that you are able to compare and contrast in the same paradigms                the sources of these cells to see which ones are going to be appropriate                for which tasks.  And I think this is extremely important.                 We're also very concerned, as you know, if these cells are                going to be continuously grown in the laboratory, there's a                finite possibility that you're going to get genetic mutations.                 We're interested in the frequencies of this, and the types of                the mutations that occur in these cells.  It's a safety issue.                 But with our genomic and proteomic studies, we can get a good handle                on this at this point in time.                 When we get into the grafting issues, which is obviously a desirable                endpoint, both in the basic science side, to say you have a functional                cell, and then transitioning into any use of these cells in cell-based                therapy, we have a number of issues here.                 The first, and I think you have to realize this.  There is virtually                no appropriate animal model for any human condition.  That's                the fact.  We approximate it.  We do the best we can.  But under                those limitations, we do the best we can.  And you have to be aware                of this.  There's a concern about what animal models you're                using for what test.                 The issue of what stage of cell differentiation in any of these                cells do you use for a specific graft?  We are finding that many                things within the central nervous system, you want to use something                that is fairly undifferentiated so that the cells can interestingly                migrate to where they're supposed to go, set up the appropriate                connectivity.  And so if you are working with a motor neuron, you'd                like to use a motor neuron precursor.  If you put in a fully differentiated                motor neuron, nothing works.  I mean, when you think about the nervous                system, it's not surprising.                 With insulin-producing cells, we find that you want the terminal                cell, at least in the experiments that we are doing.  But for each                of the cell types you're working with, we've got to determine                this, as well as how do you want to deliver it to those animal models.                              The last two are extremely important.  What are the fates of these                cells that you've grown in a dish, selected for in a dish, once                you graft it into an animal paradigm?  We know these cells like                to migrate.  Do they differentiate appropriately?  Do they form                tumors?  I remember a few years ago when I was all puffed up that                our cells were working so wonderfully, and I went to the FDA for                this meeting I thought was going to be one-on-one with members of                that group.  And it turned out that there were 40 of them and one                of me.  All their questions were about safety issues.  We now spend                as much time on these safety issues as we do at looking at differentiations                of these cells in a dish.                  Why?  Well, what have we found?  Indeed, in the early mouse work                with embryonic stem cells the rates of tumors were extremely high.                 Formation of teratocarcinomas, mixed germ cell tumors.  We have                at this point, though, grafted well over 3,000 animals with our                human cells, and we haven't seen a tumor yet.  And maybe we're                just lucky, maybe there's a difference between mouse and human                cells.  We don't know that.                  But these experiments are extremely expensive because you've                got to serial section through the whole central nervous system if                you're putting cells in there.  You're putting them in IP,                et cetera.  It's a lot of work.  The FDA, ideally, would like                to know if you're putting 300,000 cells into an animal, they                want to know where all 300,000 cells went.  This has gotten us into                extremely expensive experiments in labeling cells, developing labels                for cells that you could follow for a year or more later.  You could                go back and find those cells.  So we've employed radiologists,                and chemists, et cetera, to help us with these kinds of things.                 So it is a major issue.  And in all of our experiments, we look                at this.                 The last issue, on immune response graft rejection, is obviously                to some extent the Achilles' heel of this work.  If we can't                provide tissue that's going to be accepted in a graft, then                all this work has gone for naught.  So there are issues of active                experiments now going on in tolerance, in genetic alterations of                cells, the consideration of cell banks, how many different stem                cell lines would you need to cover certain populations of people,                and something you'll hear about probably from Rudy on nuclear                and cell reprogramming, so-called therapeutic cloning.  Is this                one of the avenues that we can approach?  So all of these are very                active research elements going on with respect to the human embryonic                germ cells and stem cells.  We can't divorce them.                 Now, in this cartoon, what I've depicted here is one of the                more difficult scientific aspects of the research.  And that is                that you have in a dish — now this is a bit of a repeat, but it's                important to mention — you have in a dish these cells that are capable                of forming any cell type that's present in the body.  The major                problem here is how do you get them only to form hepatocytes, dopaminergic                neurons, heart muscle, blood cells, pancreatic islet cells, solely.                 How do you do that?  This is where the real issues are within the                laboratory.                  And we try to recapitulate, as I showed you this before — oh,                and finally, the issue of — I put this little thing down here to                remind me.  Some of you have seen this report earlier this year                from Hans Schuler's lab at Penn, that he's been able to                find oocytes within embryonic stem cells derived from the mouse.                 Now, he did not — now keep this in mind, he did not purposefully                differentiate these cells into oocytes.  He came up with a neat                little trick of identifying them once they were present in the plate.                 Okay, so it's not that he's worked up a condition to differentiate                them only to oocytes, it's that they're there.  You can                use that technology to pull the cells out, and then further try                to mature them, see if they are actually functional oocytes, et                cetera.                 So we rely in the lab on trying to recapitulate what has occurred                to some extent in the embryo by providing growth factors that these                cells normally see to get them to enhance, or try to direct their                differentiation into the product that we want.                 We use selection techniques in the laboratory after getting these                mixtures of cell types by different avenues in the dish.  We then                come back using genetically selected markers, different growth media,                cell sorting, which is a fancy way of sending cells through a beam                of light, and if they have a certain antigen on the surface, you                tag it in a way that will put them into different pots.  And this                works fairly effectively for a number of cell types.  But it's                highly inefficient, and we've got to improve this technology.                              So what have we done?  What have we been able to do?  We've                been able to identify many, many different cell types in a dish.                 We've been able to expand many different cell types, whether                they're insulin-producing cells, dopaminergic neurons, heart                muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, we're able to                do that.  Human.  And we've been able, in many cases, to show                that they are functional within the parameters that we like.  And                in a few cases we've studied extensively we've been able                to graft them into animal models to show that they will work, and                can ameliorate a condition in the animal, whether it's, to some                degree, whether it's a diabetic animal, or one with motor neuron                loss, mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we can do that at                this point.                 To reiterate, we are concerned about safety issues.  They go hand                in hand with all that we do in the laboratory.  It adds, again,                expense and time, but we want to make sure we get it right.                 Here's another issue of safety.  We find that in many of these                cell lines, if you're not careful — now human embryonic stem                cells are much more difficult to grow in the laboratory than mouse,                and if you're not careful, this can overwhelm your cultures                very quickly.  This is an example of a tetrasomy 12p, and also of                a trisomy 17, which appear to be fairly common coming out of the                human cell lines for whatever reason.  We don't know.   But                you have to constantly monitor these cell lines to make sure that                they are remaining normal as far as the karyotype is concerned.                 Not an unusual circumstance.                 Rudy, I'm sure, will deal with this.  But we got highly involved                with the issue of somatic cell nuclear transfer, mainly coming in                from the desire to have matched tissue for a patient.  But I want                to point out two other issues here that I think, in my way of thinking,                are perhaps more important.  Rudy will probably disagree.                 Number two on this list, to increase the diversity of stem cell                lines.  Number three, to facilitate the study of inherited genetic                diseases and somatic mutations.  Now, there's been a lot of                talk about, with the justice issues, of diversity of cell lines.                 We now know how many cell lines we need to cover the population                of the United States.  How are we going to get these lines?  We're                not going to get them, if we wanted them, by going out and matching                up people to get embryos, okay, or even assaying embryos in banks.                 The easiest way to do it is you identify a person that has the haplotypes                of class I and class II genes, and take a nucleus out of their cell.                 And generate stem cells through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 No question about it, easiest fast way of doing it.                 The issue of the studying of inherited genetic mutations and somatic                mutations.  It means that we can take cells from a patient with                a disease, some of them not expressing very much from the standpoint                of the pathogenesis of the disease, to others that are full-blown,                to try to figure out why some patients have one form of the disease,                another has the mild form of the disease.  We can take this directly,                and generate stem cells for those studies.  Somatic mutations, breast                cancer mutations.  We can generate cell lines — it's the only                way we can do it — through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 And then the issue of being able to determine mechanisms of nuclear                reprogramming.  We would hope that they would approach normalcy                from the standpoint that we may be able to use that information                to convert somatic cells into stem cells at some point downstream.                 This is why I think somatic cell nuclear transfer into a human are                reasons that are quite important.                 Well, I think with the issue of the human embryonic stem cells,                I think they have uniqueness in certain areas, and I think that                what we're going to learn out of these studies is going to be                extremely important in the future, not only for deriving cell-based                therapies, but in getting information that we're going to be                able to begin to instruct our own genes.                 And this is something which hasn't been paid a lot of attention,                but I think even within this Council, it may be a good idea, that                we're on the verge, I believe, of being able to instruct our                own cells.  And I think the ramifications of this are enormous.                 I mean, talk about enhancement.  One could go on the Internet and                get a kit for enhancing any part of your body to a certain degree.                 And this is all going to be done, I think, from information that                we get out of learning about cell differentiation, how these cells                function.  So I think we've got to keep our eye on this for                the future as well.                 Just in closing, the greatest impetus that I can think of for                making advancement in this field is funding through the National                Institutes of Health.  This is the only information that I could                get my hands on.  It's available.  It's for the fiscal year                2002.  You see how much money is being spent on stem cell research                in toto, how much on human adult stem cell research, how much on                animal adult.  And up to this point, $11 million.  On the human                embryonic stem cell research, I think this year it's going to                be more, and we would hope in the future, as the bottleneck for                cell lines and more applications come in to the NIH, that these                numbers will become robust.                  And I think this will be the key to the dreams that we have, anyway,                of learning more about how humans are built, and cell differentiation                of human cells on their way to therapy.  So I hope I've given                you enough to think about.  Thanks.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Why don't we                simply proceed in order.  Dr. Jaenisch.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, thank you very much for inviting me                here.  And I will right away get to the cont roversy. I'm not                going to agree with much you said.                 So I want to try to develop two arguments.  One is reproductive                cloning faces principle biological problems that may not be solvable                for the foreseeable future.  And the other one is therapeutic cloning                poses no principle biological obstacles, only technical problems.                 And this, I think, in my opinion has implications for the status                of the fertilized and the cloned embryo.                 So you need one piece of data.  When we do nuclear transfer, then                it's clear that the donor cell, the donor matters.  So if we                use a somatic donor nucleus, cumulus cells, fibroblasts, Sertoli                cells, the result to get cloned adults is really low, a few percent.                 If you use B or T cells, or neurons, it is very low.  Only with                tricks we were able to get animals.  However, when one uses embryonic                stem cells as donors, it's an order of magnitude more efficient.                 So the conclusion is an embryonic cell is easier to reprogram to                support life than a somatic one.  I will come back to this later                when I make an argument.                 So, let me first come to cloned animals.  If you have an animal                born, if you looked at this carefully, you find that approximately                four to five percent of all genes, as done in percentile, are not                correctly expressed.  Still, the animal develops to birth.  If you                look at imprinted genes, it's even worse.  Thirty to fifty percent                are not correctly expressed, regardless what the donor cell nucleus                is.  So from this we would argue that it's amazing that these                defective embryos can develop to birth and beyond.  But you pay                for that.  You pay with abnormalities.                  So my argument would be, and I will develop this more, that there                may be no normal clones.  Of course, we have the problem to define                what we mean with ""normal"".   But let me then say that                faulty reprogramming seems to me is a biological barrier that may                preclude the generation of normal cloned individuals, at least for                the foreseeable future.                 Let me come to therapeutic cloning.  So, as we heard, cloning                would involve taking from a patient a somatic nucleus and derive                an isogenic embryonic stem cell by nuclear transfer.  This could                be used, then, to correct the genetic defect if it was present.                 One has to differentiate these cells  in vitro , and then transplant                it back into the individual and see whether it could improve the                condition.                 So we have made such an experiment.  I just want to briefly outline                the steps we went through.  As a patient we used a mouse, which                was totally immune-incompetent.  Due to the Rag2 defect, it did                not have any B and T cells.  So that was our patient.                 From this, skin cells were removed from this animal.  They were                transferred.  A blastocyst was derived.  And from this blastocyst,                an embryonic stem cell, which of course is mutant, as the donor.                 And then we used just simple homologous recombination to repair                one or two alleles to make a functional Rag2 gene, and then differentiate                these cells which had problems into hematopoietic stem cells, put                them back into the animal, and the result was that these cells could                colonize the embryo and repair, in part, the defect.                  So some have argued that this experiment really didn't work.                 It really only showed that when you have — I think Dr. Prentice                argued that it only showed that one has to use a cloned newborn                as a source.  And this, of course, is not therapeutic cloning.                 I think that is a misrepresentation of those data.                 I would argue that from this experiment we know that somatic nuclear                transfer and therapeutic cloning will work because it has worked                in the mouse.  So only technical, not principle, barriers exist                to adapt it to human use, although these technical ones may be daunting.                 Technical, in contrast to principle ones, which we see in reproductive                cloning.                 So, if I look at the two ways we can think about cell therapy,                then we have the nuclear cloning approach as I just outlined, which                in the mouse we know works, at least for hematopoietic cells, and                I believe will work for other cells.  The alternative is somatic                adult stem cells.  We'll hear later from this.                 And I believe here there are many, many question marks.  It is                a very young field, very interesting, but we really don't understand                how to really handle these stem cells, how to propagate those.                 And there's really, with the exception of bone marrow stem cells,                not really any proof of therapeutic potential at this point.  So                I think we need much more to learn here, but this we know will work.                              So I want to come to really two key questions.  One is can reproductive                cloning be made as safe as  in vitro  fertilization?  And the                other one: Does faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer, does                it pose a problem for the therapeutic application of this technology?                 I think these are the key questions in my mind.                 So, can reproductive cloning be made safe?  I believe in addition                to the technical problems, which are solvable, there are serious                biological barriers.  And the main one is this one.  The two parental                genomes in all of our cells are differentially modified depending                on where the genome came through the egg or through the sperm.                 They're epigenetically distinct in the adult.  If you want to                recreate that situation, you would have to physically separate the                two genomes and treat them independently in an oocyte- or sperm-specific                way.                 So let me point that out in this very complicated-appearing diagram,                but it's very simple.  So let me just go through briefly what's                happening during normal fertilization.  In normal fertilization,                the egg genome and the oocyte genome are combined.  And they are                differentially modified during gametogenesis.  And this is what                these lollipops here show.  So they're different in the zygote.                 But now something very curious happens.  Within hours of fertilization,                the sperm genome is stripped of all methylation.  The oocyte is                resistant to this not-well-understood demethylation activity because                the oocyte genome has been, of course, together with this activity                throughout oogenesis.                 So then cleavage proceeds.  And the point I'm making now is                that the cells of the genomes in the adult are different, different                because of their history.  It's not only for imprinted genes,                but also for non-imprinted genes.  Now what happens in cloning?                 In cloning, one removes, of course, the egg nucleus and replaces                it now with one of the somatic nuclei.                  Now, both of these genomes are now exposed to the egg cytoplasm.                 So both become really — they're in identical chromatin state.                 So they'll be both modified, and the difference will be equalized.                 So the difference you see in a normal adult cell will be equalized,                tends to be equalized in cloning.  I think that is a problem among                those which we call epigenetic problems.                 So in order to solve that, I think one would have to separate                the two genomes physically and treat one in an egg-specific appropriate                manner, and the other one in a sperm-specific manner.  I think if                we could do that, then I think we would have a way to solve that                problem.                 So the phenotypes of clones, I would argue, is a continuum without                defined stages.  So we know the most important stages are implantation                and birth, and indeed, most clones are lost at implantation, and                then at birth again many are lost.  You end up with very few which                develop to late age.  And we know from most experiments, even animals                which are one year of age, 80 percent of those die very early with                major problems.  These experiments could only be done so far in                the mouse because the mouse is the only organism we have old cloned                animals.                 So I think the problem here is, yes, you might get — because our                criteria are not very good here — you might get quasi-normal or                maybe a normal individual with a certain frequency.  It's very                difficult in animals to test, really, because our tests are limited.                 But we cannot predict ever at any of these stages who will be among                those outliers, and who will not be.  There's no way to select                good healthy from non-healthy clones.  I think that's very important                to emphasize.  There's no way we can think of to do that.  So                there's no predictability whatsoever.  So from my point of view,                this doesn't matter, really, whether one or two percent of potentially                normal animals which survive for a long time.  You can't predict                who this will be.                 So, therapeutic cloning.  So, as I said, cloned animals are abnormal                due to faulty reprogramming.  Why is normalcy of differentiated                cells derived from ES cells not affected by this problem?  There                are two reasons.  One is that we don't involve a generation                of a fetus.  And the other one is that the embryonic stem cells                lose what I'm going to call epigenetic memory of the nucleus                they came from.  So let me develop these two ideas.                 So first, it's simple.  In contrast to reproductive cloning,                there's no embryogenesis required to derive functional cells                 in vitro .  So it's totally irrelevant, for example, whether                imprinted genes are reprogrammed or not.  Imprinted genes have a                function only during fetal development, not in the adult.  So it                doesn't matter.  There is one or two exceptions, and those would                have to look at.                 Very importantly is the cells themselves select themselves  in                vitro  for the cell type you are selecting for.  There's                no selection possible  in vivo  after implantation in a cloned                animal.  And then we know that cloned ES cells form normal chimeras,                as do any other ES cells.  So biologically there is no difference.                              Let me come to the memory question on this slide here.  So we                know we can make blastocysts from a zygote from a fertilized egg,                or by nuclear transfer from these various donor cells.  Now I would                argue the blastocyst remembers exactly where it came from.  And                we know that because we implant this blastocyst, derived from a                zygote, into the uterus, it will with a high efficiency develop                to birth, and will make a normal animal.                 If you derive - take a blastocyst derived from an ES cell, and                implant it, it will develop with a high efficiency to the newborn                stage, but it will make an abnormal animal.  If it came from a cumulus                cell, it would be very low efficiency - I showed you this on the                second slide - low efficiency to the newborn stage.  It will be                abnormal.  If the nucleus comes from B-, T-cells, or neurons, it                will be very low.  And it will be, of course, abnormal, if you get                it.                 So these blastocysts know exactly where they came from.  And we                know this, actually, when we look at gene expression patterns in                clones derived from ES cells, or from human cells, they're different.                 So they remember at birth where they came from.  That's why                cloning doesn't work.  That's why these cloned ones develop                abnormally, too, in the great majority.                 So what about ES cells?  In ES cells, it's a very different                thing.  I would argue you erase the epigenetic memory of your donor                nucleus.  And the argument is the following.  We know that if you                take such a blastocyst, the ES cells are derived from the inner                cell mast cells.  These inner cell mast cells express certain set                of genes, one of those called the Oct-4 gene, one of the key genes,                but another 70.  You put this blastocyst in culture.  All these                genes, all these cells array - silence, Oct-4.  This has been published.                 And they don't divide.  They sit there.                 But over the next days or week or so, some of these cells, one                or the other, begins to re-express Oct-4 and another set of 70 genes.                 And these are the cells which would proliferate.  And we call them                ES cells.  It's a total tissue culture artifact of those cells                which can survive under the harsh tissue culture conditions.  So                I would argue ES cells have no counterpart in the normal animal                model.  They are a real tissue culture artifact, although a very                useful one.                 Now the same occurs, of course, with these blastocysts.  The efficiency                is lower.  But once you go to the selection for the survivors, they're                exactly - I think in order to survive, they have to express the                set of 70 genes which we call the embryonic genes, which are important                for the early developmental stages.  So the point of this slide                is really that this selection process, which selects just for the                fastest growing cell, erases the memory to where the ES cell came                from.  And indeed, when you transplant these cells derived from                a B- or T-cell or from a neuron or from a zygote, they have identical                properties.  They form normal chimeras, and they  in vitro                 differentiate indistinguishably.                 I want to summarize this.  An ES cell derivation selects for survivors.                 And I would argue survival depends on an ES default epigenetic state                which needs these Oct-4 like genes being on.  Selection process                erases the epigenetic memory of the donor nucleus, and the cloned                and the fertilized cells form normal chimeras.  So the potential                of ES cells derived from an  in vitro  fertilized embryo and                from a cloned embryo is identical by all measures we can do.                 So I would conclude, then, it's unlikely, if not impossible,                to create a normal individual by nuclear cloning.  The problem of                reprogramming may not be solvable for the foreseeable future because                of these principle barriers, but ES cells derived from clone embryos                have the same potential for tissue repair as those from the fertilized                embryo.                  So I think one of the key concerns I can see of this committee                is that the derivation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning                necessitates the destruction of potential human life.  I think that's                a major concern.  And if I just compare now, to my opinion, the                difference between a fertilized and a cloned embryo.  The fertilized                embryo is created by conception.  It's genetically unique.                 There's a high potential it will develop to a normal baby.                 The cloned embryo of course has no conception, no new genetic combination.                 It is really the product of a laboratory-assisted technique.  Sloppily,                we could say it's a laboratory artifact.  But most importantly,                it has little or no potential to ever develop to a normal baby.                              So I think the embryo, the cloned embryo, lacks essential qualities                of the normal embryo, which on this sort of maybe summarizing my                thoughts is on this slide where I think there are really three possible                fates for a cloned or for fertilized embryo.  We fertilize one of                these leftover embryos, hundreds of thousands in the clinics.  They                can be disposed of, they can be implanted to form a normal baby                with a high probability, or they can generate normal ES cells.                 The cloned embryo, three fates.  It can be disposed of.  It can                make normal ES cells, as I have argued, but it cannot make with                any acceptability efficiency a baby, not even a normal one.                 So if this is accepted, instead of disposing these leftover embryos                and use them for normal ES cells, which could be used for research,                as we heard.  This, of course, to my opinion generates an ethical                problem because you destroy potential human life.  I think this                - so if this is acceptable to some, I think it should be ethically                less problematic, because in this case I think you don't have                the potential to form, within acceptable possibility, a normal baby.                              So from the biological point of view, I think the derivation of                embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning develops the structure of                an embryo that lacks the potential to develop into a normal being                with any acceptable efficiency or predictability.                  I was asked - and I want to close with my final slide, which really                follows what John said - what are the potential applications of                cloned embryonic stem cells derived from a cloned embryo.  I think                we talked about therapy.  Clearly, I don't have to dwell on                this.  I'm not sure whether this will be really generally available                technology.  It maybe too expensive.  I don't know.  And I don't                know how fast we could solve the technical problems of adapting                this to human medicine.                  However, I think this is the more important point, which I think                John emphasized.  I think it allows us to derive genetically identical                cells from patients with multigenic diseases, such as Parkinson's,                Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes.  And we can now use this system                 in vitro  to validate the cellular defects of these complex                diseases.  So compare ES cells derived from a healthy individual                with those from such a patient.  I think there's enormous potential                here if we find a difference, to find out why that is so, and is                it a screen for potential therapeutics, just in the culture dish.                 And as John emphasized, such diseases cannot be studied in animal                models, because there are no animal models for those diseases.                 But you can really make those in the culture if you just use a cell                of the patients.                 So I think this is a very important, maybe the most important                driving issue, to my opinion, to use this technology.  Thank you.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Dr. Prentice. While                we're waiting, Dr. Jaenisch, would you mind just taking one                question of just factual information so that we don't lose a                lot of time.  This last point about the models for multigenetic                diseases.  If someone were to say the same kind of models might                be available through, for example, the multipotent progenitor cells                that Dr. Verfaillie has, where you could go into the patient and                get out progenitor cells.  You might not get all the tissues, but                if those cells could reliably be differentiated into islet cells,                couldn't you do the studies on the pathogenesis of - in other                words, couldn't one, if one had stable and reliable adult stem                cell populations, wouldn't you have the same access to the cells                from the multigenetic diseases?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think if this would work, if this                would efficiently work, I think absolutely I agree with you.  I                think the problem as I see it now is that, indeed, working with                adult stem cells is very difficult.  And the major problem is that                we lack the ability in most cases to, for example, propagate them                in the undifferentiated state.  For example, with bone marrow stem                cells, although they're known for 30 years, this has not been                accomplished.  They are very useful for therapeutic applications                because they select themselves in the patient, but not easily for                this type of research, what you want to do.                 So I think there might, at some point, if we learn that in this                young field, I agree with you.  Then I think these cells would,                if you could differentiate them to dopaminergic neurons in a way                that we can do for now from ES cells, as Ron McKay has shown, yes                I think that would be useful.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Dr. Prentice, you're all                right?                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:  Good.                  DR. PRENTICE:  I think we're ready to roll.  Thank you,                Mr. Chairman.  I apologize for the delay up here.  I was fighting                off a fever from a respiratory virus, so I probably was in a time                warp.                 One of the main goals of stem cell research, as you're all                aware, is the idea of regenerative medicine with stem cells, the                idea that you might be able to take a stem cell from some source,                for example here from bone marrow, inject that into an area of damaged                tissue in the patient and regenerate or replace the damaged tissue.                               Now, the interesting, confusing thing about adult stem cells has                been that it defies what for years we have thought of as the normal                developmental paradigm, that as we develop from the blastocyst stage                here, that cells follow one of these main developmental trees.                 And as a cell would become more and more developed and more and                more differentiated, they would end up out here on the tip of a                branch and not be able to back away from that particular tip; not                be able to back down and take a separate branch, whether it were                a nearby branch or one of these main branches.                 A lot of evidence now suggests, however, that adult stem cells,                at least some of them, can actually move from branch to branch.                 Now exactly how they're doing that, the mechanism involved in                these types of differentiation or different branches of tissues,                is still unknown.                  There's several questions related to adult stem cells, and                in fact many of these have to do with the same questions related                to embryonic cells.  What is their actual identity?  How could you                identify a particular adult stem cell?  What is their actual tissue                source?  How do they form these other cell and tissue types?  Do                they form actual functional cell and tissue types, as we look at                these organs and tissues?  And what's the specific mechanism                of differentiation?                 They do seem to have some unique characteristics, such as a homing                phenomenon, where they tend to home in on damaged tissue.  And most                of the results that have been seen in terms of an adult stem cell                differentiating into another cell type or tissue type seem to be                tied primarily with injury to a tissue or organ.  Usually you do                not see these types of changes in the experiments taking place unless                there is some sort of damage.  The other thing would be what type                of cellular interactions and signalling within the target tissue                might trigger some of these differentiative events.                  Now, one way to try and identify a stem cell is with various markers,                and I discuss this at some length in the paper.  Typically what                people have tried to do is eliminate what are termed ""lineage                markers"" for particular blood cells.  Some people pick a particular                marker called CD34, which has been associated with bone marrow.                 But others tend to eschew that type of marker.  And I mentioned                other markers in the paper that might indicate that an adult cell                is a stem cell.  The CD133 marker, or the c-kit marker.                 Several people have begun to undertake studies of the gene expression                within adult stem cells, and compare them to embryonic cells to                see if there is a commonality in terms of all of the various genes                that might be expressed that identify a cell as a stem cell.  One                of the problems that's been faced, though, is that these markers                tend to change over time.  This has been seen in several studies                where actually a marker such as CD34, that might have been a chosen                marker to identify a stem cell, actually might not be expressed                at a later time with that cell.  And then expression of that gene                would re-occur, even within the same cell.                 So it may be difficult to actually identify one particular stem                cell based on some of these markers, simply because of changes in                gene expressions as the cells undergo changes in environment, as                they may undergo changes in their isolation conditions, and what                Theise and Krause simply have called the uncertainty principle,                equivalent to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  You might at                one point be able to isolate a cell with a particular set of markers                or milieu of gene expression and say this is a stem cell, but then                as you would try to put it into different conditions, or isolate                it from different tissues, those particular markers might change,                or might be different.                  So it may actually be very difficult with adult stem cells to                particularly isolate a particular cell and say, yes, this is an                adult stem cell.  It may be more a matter of the particular context                of the cell: the tissue they're derived from, the isolation                conditions used, or the tissues that they're put back into that                may determine their functionality.                 In terms of differentiation mechanisms, cell fusion appears to                be one particular mechanism by which an adult stem cell may change                into another tissue type.  Now there were some  in vitro  experiments                done approximately a year and a half ago that indicated this possibility,                but the  in vitro  experiments were unable to verify whether                this was actually a particular mechanism that might be used by an                adult stem cell.  More recently, two papers have verified in mouse                systems that bone marrow stem cells, at least in these experiments,                did fuse with hepatocytes and take on that differentiated morphology                and function, even in terms of repairing liver damage.  So this                is obviously one possible mechanism with some experimental evidence.                              Another possibility might be that a cell would de-differentiate,                actually back down one of those branches and go up another branch.                 This would involve changes in gene expression to an earlier state,                or more primitive type of cell, and then re-expressing specific                genes particular to the tissue into which the cell was placed.                 Another possibility is what's termed ""trans-differentiation""                in which the cell apparently is not backing down a branch, but instead                simply changing its gene expression so that it now conforms to whatever                tissue or cell population that it's within.                  In terms of sources of adult stem cells, not just tissues, but                how did they get there?  How did an adult stem cell get into bone                marrow, or brain, or liver?  One theory is that some of these cells                may be leftover primitive stem cells, perhaps embryonic stem cells,                a few that are kept around, maintained in a state so that then they                can differentiate into various types of tissues.                  Another proposal is that there may be a universal stem cell, an                adult stem cell, not a primitive cell, but one more geared towards                maintenance and repair functions in the adult body.  It may arise                in one or more tissues, and then may disperse into other tissues.                               Other possibilities are that there are particular tissue stem                cells, multipotent, not able to perhaps form all tissues of the                adult body, but a limited subset, and that they would be resident                within a few of these tissues.                  And then I mentioned here transient stem cells, cells that are                just sort of passing through.  And there is the possibility that,                especially if we're looking at this idea of a universal stem                cell, or even a tissue stem cell that can migrate in some cases,                that it may end up passing through a tissue, so you will isolate                what appears to be a stem cell from a particular tissue.  But it                didn't arise there.  It just happened to be passing through                via the circulatory system.                 I might mention, too, that some of the other challenges for adult                stem cells are very similar to some of the challenges for embryonic                cells.  For example, standardization.  There essentially is no standardization                in terms of adult stem cell isolation, propagation, differentiation                into other tissues at this point.  Long term culture, with a few                exceptions, has not been attained.  Catherine Verfaillie's MAPC                cells from bone marrow do appear capable of long-term proliferation                in culture.  And there are a few other examples, very limited, that                I point out in the paper.  But being able to keep these cells growing                in culture for a long period of time has been difficult up to this                point.                 The idea of safety, of course, is always an issue when we're                going to be dealing with patients.  Do these cells form tumors?                 Do they differentiate abnormally so that you don't get the correct                differentiation in the place, in the time, in the tissue that you                need?  So all of these need to be faced.                 Now this idea of a potential universal or at least tissue stem                cell that can migrate primarily has been put forth by Helen Blau                of Stanford, the idea being that perhaps the cell is in the bone                marrow, but then can go into the circulation and then exit the circulation                into another tissue.  Again, most of the studies have seen this                type of phenomenon in response to an injury, not in response to                the normal physiological systems.                 How would we then define a stem cell, especially an adult stem                cell, if we have all of this problem with changeability of markers,                and lack of standardization?  Moore and Quesenberry have proposed                a couple of simple guidelines.  Now obviously, any stem cell has                the ability to continue to replicate and maintain a population of                cells.  And then in response to some signal, to differentiate into                one or more potential tissue types.                  An initial first cut at how to identify a stem cell in the adult                would be, can it take on a different morphology in a tissue in which                you place it?  Can it take on some of the differentiated cell markers                that you would see in that tissue?  Now this is a bare minimum,                and it doesn't really mean necessarily that the cell is functional,                that it can participate in tissue repair, or perhaps even that it                has truly differentiated into that specific cell type.                 Supplementing that, if you could demonstrate functional activity,                and actual integration into a tissue, this would be a much better                marker of a cell as a stem cell.  And certainly, if in an injury                situation, in animal model or even in human, you could demonstrate                a physiological improvement.  That would be a good indication that                you were seeing this sort of stem cell differentiation and repair.                              Now, the next set of slides, what I've tried to do is just                condense from that rather difficult mass to read of all of these                various tissue sources, and cell types that they can turn into,                and so on.  I won't spend a great deal of time on these.  I'll                just try and point out some particular points on each slide.                 With mesenchymal or stromal stem cells from the bone marrow, we                need to keep in mind that bone marrow is a mixed population.  We've                known about hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow since the                1960s.  These are well-studied and used clinically.  The hematopoietic                stem cell is differentiating primarily, at least, into blood cells.                               Another stem cell that's in the bone marrow is this mesenchymal,                or stromal, cell.  As I mentioned in the paper, one way that this                type of cell is actually isolated is perhaps first by markers, but                then also simply by its ability to form attached adherent layers                in the culture dish, once you're putting them into the dish                in the lab.                  Now, there have been various studies, and I've just tried                to collect a number of them here, showing potential differentiation                into different tissue types, either in the lab dish, or in the animal.                 Again, the way they're following this in the animal is primarily                to use a genetic or a fluorescent marker, follow the cell, see what                tissue it ends up in, and look at its morphology, and then also                potentially try to analyze functionality and integration into the                tissue.                 In various disease models, some of these cells have been used.                 For example, in models of stroke.  And I want to point out again                what Dr. Gearhart said.  Animal models are only an approximation.                 This does not tell us the actual situation that we might encounter                in human beings.  But at this point, it's the best we can do.                 We can see if these cells might participate in cell and tissue repair.                 Using rat or human cells, there has been some therapeutic benefit                in some of these disease models in stroke with animals.  With demyelinated                spinal cord.                 Intravenous injection, interestingly enough, of mesenchymal stem                cells in the mouse has shown some remyelinization in spinal cord                injury.  Adult stem cells are not alone in terms of this ability.                 Other cell types have shown this.  And this does not necessarily                mean that you've totally corrected the condition.  It simply                means that you're able to provide some sort of functional recovering                of a bare nerve.                 Another interesting point about this particular study was that                they did not see a large incorporation of these cells into the spinal                cord tissue.  So what benefit they did see did not appear to be                due primarily to the adult stem cells actually differentiating into                the myelinating cells here.  Instead, what appeared to be happening                was the presence of those cells caused a signal for the endogenous                cells to start to re-grow and repair the damage.                  In fact, Dr. Gearhart's lab just recently published a paper                showing that embryonic germ cells showed in a particular mouse model                the same type of repair phenomena.  The mice did show therapeutic                benefit.  But what they found was that the cells did not, to a large                extent, integrate in and participate in the repair.  Instead, it                seemed to be a signalling phenomenon.  And I'll point this out                in a couple of other examples along the way.                 There has been one clinical trial that I could find in the literature                where 11 patients were treated for Hurler syndrome, or metachromatic                leukodystrophy using allogeneic, and not from the original patient,                but from donor mesenchymal cells.  Now, the study noted that four                out of those eleven patients showed a small increase in nerve conductance.                 One of the problems with these diseases is a decrease in nerve conductance.                 There are other neurological effects, and so on.  So small increase.                              And in terms of loss of bone mass, all 11 patients seemed to maintain,                at least for a certain time.  But in terms of any of the other symptoms                in these patients, there was no effect of the adult stem cells.                 Very early study.                 Using mixed population of bone marrow stem cells.  So in this                case, and again, this lack of identifiability for a particular adult                stem cell.  What many people have done is simply take raw bone marrow                and either in culture try to get various differentiations, or putting                back into the animal in various disease models.  And they've                been tried in quite a number of disease models showing some therapeutic                benefit.  In this particular case, again in stroke, intravenous                injection of this mixed population of cells.  Again, no attempt                to purify the cells, or identify the particular cell that's                being used for the treatment of the animal model.  But the cells                in this case did home in on the damage.  Again, this interesting                phenomenon that we've seen.                 Various other conditions.  There was an interesting study relating                to cardiac damage, where cells from mice were actually put into                rats.  And what they noticed was over a fairly extended period of                time there did not appear to be immune rejection of these transplanted                cells, even though they were even from a different species.                  Now, it's only one study.  Does that mean that these particular                cells might be immune privileged and not subject to rejection?                 Only more experiments will tell.  Recent study indicated that with                diabetes, in a mouse model again, where the pancreas was damaged                to induce loss of insulin secretion, bone marrow stem cells injected                into the animal could regenerate insulin-secreting cells.  As in                the other example I mentioned before, there was very low incorporation                of the actual bone marrow stem cells identified as forming insulin-secreting                cells.  Instead, what they seemed to be doing in this instance was                again secreting particular growth or stimulatory factors to stimulate                the endogenous cells to re-form insulin-secreting cells.                 And there have been several clinical trials and publications,                peer reviewed publications, from those trials, primarily with cardiac                damage.  There have been several groups in Germany and a group in                Japan that have published their results.  Again, very, very limited                numbers of patients, we must keep in mind.  And what they're                seeing, though, is some physiological improvement in the ejection                fraction from the heart, and when they actually examine some of                the damage that seems to be being repaired.  One Japanese group                has reported growth of blood vessels in limbs that were threatened                to be lost by gangrene.                  Peripheral blood.  Probably we should just skip this category,                in a sense, because they seem to be very similar to the bone marrow                stem cells.  And it makes a lot of sense that bone marrow stem cells                could actually enter the circulation.  The interesting thing is                that two groups recently have isolated peripheral blood stem cells                from human blood.  One group in particular noticed that the cells                that they isolated showed high levels of Oct-4 expression, this                gene that's associated with pluripotent status of a stem cell.                              In a couple of animal disease models for stroke and cardiac damage,                and I put this under peripheral blood because what the workers did                was not remove adult stem cells and then re-implant them in the                animal.  They injected growth factors to stimulate mobilization                of the stem cells, most likely from bone marrow.  And these cells                appeared to provide a therapeutic benefit in these conditions.                 And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about mobilization                later.                  Neural stem cells.  I certainly was taught in graduate school                that you start with as many brain cells as you're ever going                to have and it's downhill from there.  And on my campus, it's                downhill even faster on a good Friday or Saturday night.  But within                the last decade or so, the discovery that there are these stem cells                within neural tissue that can at least regenerate all three main                neuronal types, and perhaps some other tissue types as well.                  Interestingly enough, they have been used in some animal disease                models to show some therapeutic benefit.  And there have been some                clinical trials, very early.  There is one Parkinson's patient                who was treated with his own neuronal stem cells.  The cells were                removed, grown in culture for awhile, and placed back just into                one side of the brain.  He did see a benefit.  He did see improvement.                              In terms of spinal cord injury, there are no peer reviewed publications                in terms of actual human treatment.  But there have been reports                that at least one group in Portugal are beginning these types of                treatments on patients for spinal cord injury.                  Dr. Gearhart mentioned the embryonic carcinoma cells.  And there's                one group of this cell termed usually ""hNT"" that you might                say has been tamed in culture.  This particular line that they've                come across primarily forms neuronal-type cells in culture, and,                as he mentioned, it's being used in a beginning clinical trial                on stroke.                  Muscle stem cell can regenerate itself.  It has its own stem cell,                primarily dedicated to forming more muscle.  But there's indication                that it does have, perhaps, another stem cell present in that population.                 Debate as to whether those cells can actually form blood, or if                that was one of these so-called transient cells moving through.                 The potential though, perhaps, to form bone from this type of cell,                and these muscle stem cells have been used in some disease models,                primarily directed back towards muscle.  Very interesting one that                I came across was to re-form bladder muscle, or at least reinforce                bladder muscle, in a rat model of incontinence.  And there's                been one published paper regarding a clinical trial using muscle                stem cells, one patient, in France, where the patient did seem to                receive some therapeutic benefit from the muscle stem cells.                 Liver stem cells and pancreatic stem cells.  Pancreas and the                liver derive from the same embryonic primordia.  And so it might                not be surprising that you tend to see liver able to form pancreas,                or pancreas able to form liver.  The interesting thing here is that                genetically engineered liver stem cells, simply by adding and activating                a gene, have helped an animal model induce diabetes in these animals.                 The pancreatic stem cells, likewise, have shown the similar ability.                              Corneal limbal stem cells are a very limited subset.  And what                we might in one sense call a unipotent stem cell, at least for the                most part, other than one or two little reports, so that they would                re-form only the tissue in which they're located.  They have                been used, however, in corneal transplants in a number of countries.                 And there are several published reports on this.   In vitro ,                one group was able to get them to form neuronal cells in culture,                or what looked like neuronal cells.                 Cartilage, again, a very limited sort of application, but clinical                trials for articular cartilage transplants.  And one group has used                them in an attempt to treat children with osteogenesis imperfecta.                               Umbilical cord blood, not a great deal of research has been done,                but there are a growing number of publications.  The interesting                thing here is, in terms of the disease models, stroke, spinal cord                injury, and one particular model of ALS, the cells are delivered                intravenously.  So again, this potential to home in on areas of                damage.                 And then just a list of a number of other tissues here where some                type of adult stem cell has been identified, or potentially identified.                 And I want to point out the adipose, or fat-derived stem cells.                 And I use ""derived"" because it's very likely this                is one of those transient stem cells moving through via the circulatory                system.  Interestingly enough, though, it provides a reliable, readily                available source, you might say, from liposuction fat.  And one                group has been able to see neuronal differentiation in the lab;                not in any animal models yet.                 Now, in terms of activation and mobilizing these adult stem cells,                this may be actually one of the best directions to go in terms of                potential clinical treatments.  Simply because it may not be the                stem cells themselves that participate in the repair of the damage.                 And in that case, maybe what we need to do is simply activate the                cells so that they can deliver the signal to the damaged tissue.                 And again, there may be various states within the bone marrow as                an example of a tissue where you might activate, where the cell                could be activated and then mobilized into the circulatory system,                and then reach the particular tissue to differentiate.                 Again, there were two animal models that had been used, one for                cardiac damage, and one for stroke, where there was an indication                that this might be a potential avenue of research.  Rather than                removing the cells, having to culture them, isolate them, identify                them, put them back, simply being able to mobilize the cells within                the body.                  Another possibility is genetic engineering.  And in terms of actual                animal models of disease, genetically engineered adult stem cells                have been used in a few examples in the publications.  In lung,                that one particular reference indicated that there was a large contribution                of the adult cells to lung tissue.  Again, a damaged tissue system.                              Clinical trials, not directly, you might say, repairing a damaged                tissue.  But in Severe Combined Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome, bubble                boy syndrome, several infants have been treated using genetically                modified bone marrow stem cells from the patient.  They seem to                have been, quote, ""cured,"" and I use that word advisedly,                of the disease.  There have been reports that at least two, and                potentially a third infant, has come down with leukemia as a result                of that treatment, most likely due to the viral vector that was                used to insert the gene into those cells.  Because the gene is not                targeted in those instances.  Instead, it may go into an area where                it can activate oncogenic genes within the cells.                  In terms of delivering the signal, this might be an even better                use of genetic engineering in adult stem cells.  And there have                been a few published examples, potentially for use in animal models                with tumor therapy, to alleviate some of the symptoms in the model                of Niemann-Pick disease for increasing bone healing, and in a Parkinson's                model, where the cells were not participating to any great extent                in repair of the tissue.  Instead, they're delivering a signal                to the endogenous cells there, and stimulating them.                 And in terms of that then, perhaps the best avenue eventually                to pursue might be trying to isolate what these factors are, so                that no stem cells would be needed at all.  Instead, if you can                identify those factors to stimulate regeneration within the tissue,                they could be delivered directly.                  And there are a few published examples of this, one in which there                was some axon regrowth, some, in a rat spinal cord injury model                by injecting a couple of different factors.  One mouse Parkinson's                model study infused directly a factor into the brain of the mouse                model and saw a therapeutic benefit.  Another publication lists                a different factor in terms of a model of chronic kidney damage.                 And one clinical trial where five patients, five Parkinson's                patients were treated with infusion of this glial-derived neurotrophic                factor, they did see some improvement.  Not a cure, and it may be                that that's not the sole signal that's needed, or the correct                signal.  But it did seem to stimulate some physiological improvement                in the patients.                 Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   For a young field, there's a lot going                on.  And we have also talked our way late into the hour.  Let me                make a suggestion, if I might.  Technically, this session was to                run till 3:30, with the next to start at a quarter of 4:00.  I'm                going to take the liberty of suggesting we spend a half an hour                here at least with our visitors to get some of our questions asked.                 And if Lori Andrews will forgive us, we'll be pushing back the                start of the next session, just so we can get the questions asked.                              Michael Sandel, then Jim Wilson.                 DR. SANDEL:  I learned a great deal from all of these presentations,                as I suspect we all did.  I was especially struck by one feature                of Dr. Jaenisch's presentation, and I'd like to put this                as an observation which actually will end with a question.                 The subtitle of the paper and of the talk, Dr. Jaenisch, and my                Council colleagues will appreciate this perhaps more than our visitors.                 The subtitle could well have been, ""The Vindication of Paul                McHugh.""  Because when we were discussing the biology of cloning,                almost everyone here shared an assumption, regardless of the positions                that we took on the ethical issues.  Almost everyone took it for                granted that biologically the fertilized embryos and cloned embryos                were essentially the same, and the moral argument proceeded from                that assumption.  With the exception of one person, Paul McHugh.                               And he introduced a distinction, a distinction, as he put it,                between a zygote and a ""clonote"", by which he meant the                cloned embryo, the product of cloning.  And for insisting on this                distinction, poor Paul suffered heaps of ridicule and abuse, and,                at best, a kind of bemused chuckling, by those of us around the                table.  And he argued that there's a difference, a biological                difference, with a possible ethical significance between a zygote                and a clonote, between a fertilized embryo and an artifact created                in the lab.  And he was told that this is an eccentric position.                 He was told that this is an off the wall distinction, that it had                no basis in biology or science.                  And in a memorable exchange with our colleague Charles, who unfortunately                isn't here for the benefit of this discussion, he was asked,                ""Well, but what if a cloned embryo actually came to term?                 Isn't Dolly a sheep?""  And Paul's answer was, ""Well,                a sick sheep.""                 And then we read, Dr. Jaenisch, in your paper that a cloned human                embryo would have little, if any, potential to develop into a normal                human being, that it lacks essential attributes that characterize                the beginning of normal human life.  And you explained that it has                to do with faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer.                 Now, I don't know whether that's true, whether it's                generally accepted, or controversial in the scientific community.                 But whatever the case, it seems that what we regarded here as an                eccentric, off the wall suggestion, that there is a biologically                significant difference between a fertilized embryo and a cloned                embryo, now, if I understand you correctly and here's my question,                now, you're telling us that far from being eccentric or off                the wall, Paul's position may be true.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that was the whole purpose                of going through these arguments for me.  To argue from a biological                point of view, it is a continuum.  We have to struggle with that.                 And we have, for the early, most abnormal stage, we have good markers.                 Death is a terrific marker.  Then we have molecular markers after                birth, or we have aging as another marker.                 So these are concrete markers, and we know these animals are not                normal.  So when it is claimed that cows on the field are normal,                which has been published by ACT.  They looked at their one- to four-year-old                cows sit on the fields and eat and give milk.  They argued, well,                they must be normal.  So they checked that.  And they checked it                by checking if it had a heart.  Yes, it had a heart.  A liver, yes                they had a liver, and that serum, even.  So they concluded they                must be normal and publish this in ""Science"".                 Now, this of course is a very superficial way of looking at it.                 And very interesting.  Once this paper came out, six months later,                two of these healthy cows, one got multiple tumors, the other one                generalized seizures.  Now this is not normal.  You wait, and these                things come out.                 The point I was trying to make is that these are stochastic problems.                 There is not a key master gene which, if this is right then the                embryo's right.  No.  The whole genome is stochastically, correctly                reprogrammed or not.  And what's amazing to me is that mammalian                development is so regulative that it can tolerate so much gene disregulation                and still get an animal to birth and beyond.  But you pay for that.                 You pay with subtle or less subtle, more or less subtle problems.                               And of course, because it's stochastic, you will arrive at                the end at some animals which live a normal life span.  And by all                our available tests they might be normal, or you might not see it.                 If you look at the primate, or in the human, we might see this because                we could look at some much more subtle phenotypes.                  So I think the point I was trying to make is if you want to use                this as a technique to generate human beings, there's no predictability.                 You cannot do this.  And for me, it doesn't matter with one                percent or two maybe something normal, because you can't predict                it before.                 So I totally agree with what your thought was.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Michael asked the same question I was going                to ask using virtually the same words.  I guess it's the Harvard                affliction.                 But I want to just press a bit more.  An oocyte is not potential                human life because it's an unfertilized egg.  You can enucleate                it and put in a new nucleus, and now it is a clone.  But according                to your account, a cloned embryo has little, if any, potential to                ever develop into a normal human being.                 If you would step back, then, from your biological role and adopt                a somewhat more philosophical role, would you say that a clone,                therefore, is not potential human life?                  DR. JAENISCH:   I would argue it's not potential normal                human life.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think that's the only thing I can                say.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And Dolly still is a sheep?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Still was a sick sheep, was a very sick                sheep, and which died, of course, predictably very early.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I, too, learned a great deal this afternoon.                 I want to make two comments, and then I have a question for Rudy.                              The first comment is that I think it is most unfortunate that                we're prevented from asking our experts, and particularly John                Gearhart, about the status of funding that supports this very critical                area of science.                  The second comment is also directed to John.  And I was struck                by the specific chromosome abnormalities that you identified in                your human embryonic cells, because you probably know that an isochromosome                for 12p is the most common abnormality in human testicular carcinoma.                               So it's astonishing that this is the abnormality that you                see in these cells, and I'm sure it is extraordinarily important.                              The question that I have for Rudy — I was surprised when you said                that imprinted genes are only important in embryogenesis, because                clearly there are a number of human conditions.                 Now, you could say, well, human condition and the malformations                occur because of embryogenesis, but there is also this whole question                of imprinting and its relationship to carcinogenesis.  So I'd                like you to expand on that.                  DR. JAENISCH:   This is a very important point you're                bringing up, so I was probably a little bit generalized.  So I think                most imprinting, as we know, have — so that could be among these                things that could be the most interesting, because it's IGF-2,                which is a loose cannon.                  IGF-2 is a tumor, an oncogene essentially, so this would be available                for cloning, because IGF-2 is very easily dysregulated.  And I would                worry if you have both copies active, because that's pretumor                status.  So you want to screen for this.                 But the other genes — for all of the other genes, for example,                an Angelman Syndrome probably really is — there are really problems                of fetal development.  So these genes and fetal development — I                could go further into this, because it's really growth of the                fetus, where these genes appear to play the most important role.                              And there's really no evidence, with the exception of IGF-2,                maybe KIP-257, which is a tumor suppressor gene, those are the ones                you would worry about.  So I think we know only two of those, and                those you would test for I think.                  So I agree, which makes this a little bit more restrictive when                I say it.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Right.  And there probably are others that                we don't know about, but —                  DR. JAENISCH:   There might be others which we don't                know —                  DR. ROWLEY:   — you're saying that they would —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.                  DR. ROWLEY:   — just all be tested for.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those two we know for sure, but others we                know they don't play a role.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have myself next, if I might.  A question                for Dr. Prentice, and then for the group as a whole.  In Dr. Gearhart's                presentation, he gave a great deal of emphasis to the importance                of the characterization of these cells, the reproducibility, all                of these various things.                 You had to cover an enormous amount of material in the number                of papers, and you also in your presentation alluded to the problem                of characterization, though I gather many of these studies seem                to be one-shot efforts of throwing some things in and trying to                see what their clinical effect might be.                 And as I've read the debates, a lot of people wonder, are                these really stem cells?  How well characterized are they?  So could                you say something about what criteria should be used for these stem                cell preparations?                  What criteria would they have to meet before you could satisfy                the critics that these are, in fact, fit to be called human stem                cells, and fit, therefore, for controlled studies on the kinds of                things that you're talking about here?                 And kind of a subordinate question, what's the best characterized                of, and the most versatile of, these adult stem cell preparations?                 Are there any that at the moment meet the criteria that you yourself                would advance?                  DR. PRENTICE:   In answer to your first question, it's                difficult, obviously, because as you point out many of these studies                have been sort of one-shot, especially if you look at the mixed                bone marrow population studies where they are simply taking a preparation,                putting it back into a diseased animal or a diseased model, and                trying to come up with some therapeutic benefit.                 You know, obviously, what you'd like to be able to do is to                isolate the cell or the population, keeping in mind that caveat                that the population dynamics may be an important facet of this.                               But let's say there's one particular stem cell that you're                after.  Supposedly, if you saw that sort of therapeutic benefit                from the mixed population, you should be able to go in and simply                take cuts and eventually isolate that one cell, and then be able                to grow it in culture.                 In terms of the overall markers, that's been very difficult,                and there have been a few studies looking at the gene expression                common to neural stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem                cells.  And there are a subset of those genes that are common to                all of those cells.                 Now, what you would hope to be able to do, then, is to go look                at each of those genes and start using those as guides to come up                with a marker for any stem cell that would be targeted for the types                of differentiation models that we'd like to see, and eventually                clinical applications.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And with respect to the second question,                what is the best characterized and most versatile adult stem cell                preparation at the moment?  I mean, can you — is there —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Probably Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells,                and I can't speak for her, but those do show many of these characteristics                that ideally you would like — long-term growth in culture, clonogenic                growth, and then differentiation.  They've been used in a couple                of different animal models of disease to see some sort of benefit.                              One of the mesenchymal cell — stem cell lines, if I remember correctly                — and there are a lot of things to sort back through there — had                been kept in culture, I believe, for about two years.  There was                another cell line that — I think it was also a bone marrow derived                cell line, but it had been genetically engineered to contain telomerase                or additional telomerase gene.  And that had been kept in long-term                culture.                 I believe also one of the neural stem cell lines has been kept                in long-term culture, and actually Dr. Gearhart might be able to                comment more on that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.                 And I have a general question to all of you, if I might.  Since                we sent you some general questions that we were hoping to get some                help on, to go from where we are now to actually having reliable                tissue grafting therapeutic applications in humans, since there's                a fair amount of speculation out there — and, Dr. Gearhart, you                did emphasize how early we are in the process and the emphasis,                really, on learning of the basic biology.                 But the public out there is more — much more interested in, you                know, where are the cures?  Could you address that particular question                of the various sort of stages, and where we are, and what kind of                — how one should talk about these things responsibly in relation                to the widespread hopes for remedies for which the patient groups                are, quite understandably, clamoring?                  DR. GEARHART:   The answer to that question is a very complex                one for me.  I could run through a number of cell lineages with                respect to the human embryonic and stem cell and germ cell lines,                where we are in the process, but it's the other end that I want                to address.                 The most difficult talks that I give anymore are those before                patient-based groups where the hopes are high.  They come with expectations                that far exceed, I think, where we are.  And this is the result                that I think that early on in the field, as you mentioned, the hype                was there when circumspection should have been there.  And I don't                think circumspection is a retreat from promise.                 The reality is when you get into the laboratory, and you are working                on cell lines, it seems the more progress you make, the further                away the goal is as we learn.  And we can show I think remarkable                things in our animal models of putting in cells, and these are almost                — they bear some resemblance to the adult stem cell story where                you try a lot of things empirically, you get a response of some                kind, and you're trying to figure out what it is, why.                 But when you superimpose on top of the biology issues of trying                to control these cells in a dish, and trying to expand them in a                dish to characterize them, to show that they're authentic, that                they do work, the issues of safety, which I think we all are in                agreement have to be foremost in this, that the time frame is years                away before I think any of this will be realized in a clinic.                 I think there's misunderstanding, that if all of a sudden                you have an insulin-producing cell in a laboratory, which we do,                and we're — as other labs have as well — that most people think                this is the answer.  You just put insulin-producing cells into a                diabetic.  And as you know, this doesn't solve the underlying                problem.                 We can — so I don't know how to answer the question that you                ask.  I mean, I'm certainly optimistic.  I think it's going                to be a direct function, and I'll come back to Janet's question                that she can't ask or isn't supposed to ask, and that is                that obviously more funding into this area — and I know that this                isn't a congressional committee of any kind, where we're                seeking funding, but obviously the progress is directly proportional                to the number of good investigators you have working on projects.                              And in this field, we've had a bottleneck, first from the                number of lines that could be used, now the NIH funding I'm                sure is going to be more robust over time, but this remains not                only I think a financial issue but also almost a psychological one                — for students getting involved, for post-docs getting involved,                for young faculty getting involved in the field, where we don't                know what the future will be, to be honest with you, in this country.                              We see our colleagues around the world in different laboratories                I think making really substantial progress here.  And so I'll                get off this part of it, but I think this is an important issue,                at least with the embryonic and fetal sources of cells.  And I hope                we'd get over that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 I have Gil Meilaender, Bill Hurlbut, Janet.  Gil.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yes.  Dr. Jaenisch, I want to come back to                where Michael Sandel started us, because I'm just not certain                that I'm clear on something.  And what I want to know is, you                know, it's always hard to know when one's speaking as a                scientist and when one's speaking as something else.                 But as a scientist, there are various kinds of chromosomal or                genetic defects that a fetus might have, the result of which would                be that it might die immediately after birth or very soon after                that.  How would you scientifically describe those fetuses?  Would                you say that they have — that they also do not have the potential                to be a normal human being?                  I'm trying to get away from the stem cell issue for a moment.                 Would the same characterization be the appropriate one there?                  DR. JAENISCH:   This a really a question which is not a                scientific question, then, right?  An embryo which has a trisomy                number, whatever, large chromosomes will die very early, maybe before                implantation.  So that has this embryo which is afflicted with this                genetic alteration.                  Has that a normal potential development to a human being?  No.                               PROF. MEILAENDER:   So it falls into the same — so, in other words,                this is a rather large category of embryos and fetuses that — about                which we would say this.  We're not only talking about cloned                embryos.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   The same characterization —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   — would fit.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think the difference, from my point of                view, if a chromosomal abnormality occurs after normal fertilization,                something which is totally unpredictable and is assessed, that is                what fate is to genetic game.  With cloning, I think it's predictable,                and that's the difference.  It is predictable to a large extent,                so I think that would make the difference.                 One is spontaneous, unpredictable, it's a risk of normal reproduction.                 The other one is predictable.  Otherwise, I really can't — I                think this for me is a major difference.  You predictably generate                a human being which has no chance to become normal with any acceptable                efficiency.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   I think I'll stop there.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, and then Janet.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Did I hear you correctly say you find destruction                of IVF embryos morally troubling, but cloned embryos for embryonic                stem cell use less troubling?                  DR. JAENISCH:   No.  Well, I said that if you accept that                instead of throwing away an  in vitro  fertilized embryo which                cannot be implanted because nobody wants it, instead of throwing                this embryo away generating to an embryonic stem cell, I mean, people                accept this.  I find this acceptable.  But it does pose an ethical                problem, because you do destroy potential normal human life.  There's                no talking around it.                 So if you accept that, then I would argue that a cloned embryo                is less of an ethical problem.  That's all that I want to say.                 So the potential is not there.                  DR. HURLBUT:   And from hearing you and talking with you                at lunch, I had the sense that you feel like nuclear transfer actually                offers us more versatility and more promise than using IVF embryos,                because we can use the genotypes we want and control various things.                 Is this fair?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I would think so.                  DR. HURLBUT:   So I have to admit I'm troubled by your                comment, and not convinced by Michael Sandel's comment.  As                much as I like my colleague Paul McHugh, I'm not — I'm troubled                by the notion that what you called not potentially normal human                life does not have a moral standing.                 And the reason I'm troubled by that is — was just alluded                to by Gil, that I would not say that a potentially abnormal trajectory                of embryogenesis is not a human life necessarily.                  Now, I have a handicapped child myself, and she does not have                a problem of development, but she had brain damage at birth.  But                she's not what you would call a normal human life in that specifically                all-healthy sense.  But she's very human, as human as I am.                              I'll let somebody make the joke on that one, if you want.                              But the question is this.  I feel for what you're saying.                 I feel for what Michael said, and I feel — have been with Paul to                some extent on this all along.                  But if we say that natural — the natural meaning of the definition                of a human life is not normal, but some meaningful process of integrated                — of integration of identity, of continuity, then it seems to me                that the clones that have been produced at least with animal studies                have to qualify as entities of their species.                 So even though, as you said to me even a year ago, a cow standing                on a green hill chewing its cud isn't — doesn't make it                a normal cow.  I agree.  But I think it's still a cow.                 And likewise, the human trajectory of whatever the clone could                be is troublingly human-like.  I personally wouldn't feel comfortable                saying, for example, as was implied by John Gearhart in his talk,                that we could use it to harvest out later tissues for more difficult                differentiations.                 Well, let me back that up.  All of my colleagues, and my own reading                on this, confirms to me that going from embryonic stem cells to                useful cells, tissues, and organs, is a long journey, maybe short                for Parkinson's Disease, but longer for more complex tissues,                and very long for — what we really want is organs and — for transplant,                like kidneys, and so forth.                 I think there will be a temptation in our civilization to move                the trajectory of something that's designated non-human on to                further stages of gestation.  Now maybe not gestation in a human                womb.  Maybe it'll be in an artificial endometrium or something                that can coax it just 30, 60 days longer for good use.  It starts                to be troubling, even if you accept your premises.                 Let me back it up, then.  I think in principle what you're                saying has something to it, and Paul and I have been trying to talk                about this, and I've had dialogues with my colleagues on this.                               I put forward in my personal statement on the President's                Council Report on Cloning what I called a speculative proposal,                where I suggested that — drawing on what Paul had said, that this                is an artifact, not a human being, a clonal artifact.                  Why don't we go to the bottom of the problem?  Why don't                we say that something that does not have a human potential in any                meaningful way, not an abnormal human potential, but no meaningful                human potential, might supply us with the essential way to get around                the moral problem, at least to get us to stem cells?  And we can                deal with the next issues later.                 And I want to stay two things before I conclude.  One is in making                this proposal, I was very aware that the first issue of what you                might call the inviolability of the human life is only the beginning                of the questions about the moral use of human process or human tissues                or anything.                 But what I had in mind was this — that just as we've come                to see that a cell does not define the locus of human dignity, nor                does a gene, of course — let's start at the smallest.  A gene                — a human gene can be put into a bacterium, grown, used to make                insulin.  A cell — we do blood cell transplants.  Tissues — we do                skin transplants.  Organs — we do transplants and even organ systems.                 None of those are the locus of human dignity, human moral standing.                              Likewise, in this age of developmental biology, we will learn                that partial generative potentials are not the locus of human moral                standing.  We will harness these partial generative potentials in                such a way that we can do wonderful things with them without violating                the integrity, identity, and continuity of human life.                 So this is my question to you.  Could we find a scientific way                to meet the challenge of our President and our nation and the imperative                of our civilization to go forward with the science?  Could we define                the danger as we never want to interrupt a normal human life in                process, or even one that is remotely normal?                 Could we meet that moral objection while at the same time opening                the positive future of our science?  And here the suggestion I would                have is using something so fundamental, like short, interfering                RNA, to preclude the very possibility of anything but the most minimal                and genetic mammalian process to the blastocysts from which we could                then take embryonic stem cells.                 What do you think?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think we talked about this before.                 I think it's a really interesting possibility.  So what we need                to — for a human being to develop two major lineages, which is a                trophoblast lineage and the epiblast lineage.  The trophoblast lineage                will support the embryo from the placenta.                 So certainly there are genes which are only needed, as far as                we know from experiments, that are only needed for placental development.                 They are not needed for the epiblast lineage or for the embryo.                 So one would modify a donor cell — let's say a skin cell that                you want to transplant — with inactivating such a gene — I can give                you examples of those — and expressing, for example, using the SI                RNA technology, which now really becomes — seems to become a routine                procedure to inactive genes.                 And, indeed, an embryo — a cloned embryo derived from such a nucleus                would not be able to form a trophoblast lineage which would be functional.                 So, therefore, if this embryo would be implanted, it would definitely                fail.  You could predict it would fail much earlier than this continuum,                which I outlined for the cloned embryos which are not modified.                              So I think, in principle, this is a doable — potentially doable                manipulation which would prevent what you are interested in and                what you are raising, prevent the development very far in utero.                               DR. HURLBUT:   In your opinion, could we reasonably call                that not in any sense a human life in process, abnormal or normal,                but call it a clonal artifact, a laboratory production for the procurement                of cells with a potential for something, but not what we would have                to call embryonic cells?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, because you would argue this embryo                — I mean, the definition of an early embryonic cell, like a two-cell                or a four-cell embryo, the blastomere, is totipotent.  These cells                can make the placental lineage and the epiblast lineage.                 This embryo would not be able to make the trophoblast lineage,                so, therefore, it would not be totipotent.  So I think you could                argue this would be a real biological difference.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   We do want to go to the next session shortly,                but I've got Janet and Elizabeth, and then I'm going to                call a halt for this session.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I come back to John Gearhart.  And, first,                I want to take you to task for comments at the very end of your                talk, and then I have a question.  And what I want to take you to                task for are your comments, all related to enhancement and how easy                it's going to be to just get genetic enhancement of all sorts                of features.                 And I think — well, you could expand on that or explain what you                meant by that.  But this has been such a critical issue for this                particular Council — the likelihood of enhancement — that I think                that it shouldn't just be left unchallenged.                 And the question that I have is, with regard to characterization                of current lines, you indicated that that's under the auspices                of the MRC in London.  And I'm just curious, are they looking                at both so-called presidential lines as well as lines available                elsewhere?  Or are they only lines available elsewhere?  And what                kinds of characterization are they proceeding with?                  DR. GEARHART:   Let me answer the non-controversial question                first.  This is a relatively — this panel — there has been, over                the last nine months or so, an international consortium that has                been meeting on human embryonic stem cells.                 The outcome of this was the appointment of a panel headed by Peter                Andrews at Sheffield University, who will be — that panel will be                setting up the standardizations, if you will, or the criteria for                the embryonic stem cell lines.                 They will — I think some of this work will be done in the equivalent                of what's the FDA in the United Kingdom.  But they will take                any cell line that's submitted to them, whether it's a presidential                one or one from anywhere else.  They are not a — they are not distributing                cells.  They are just testing them for these different parameters.                              And, obviously, there will be a number of transcription factors,                a number of surface antigens.  This kind of thing will be in that                mix.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Will they do karyotypes?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, yes, karyotype is — yes, it's absolutely                essential to have a normal karyotype, and one that's stable                over a number of cell passages is critical.                 The comment I made about enhancements, I just — it may have been                out of order here, but I am concerned, I mean, as a biologist I'm                concerned.  I'm concerned about a number of issues.  It makes                it sound as if most of the time that scientists aren't concerned,                that we're just going along in a fashion that, you know, science                for science sake.                 And I only have to remind you over the last few months to see                the use of human embryonic stem cells in mouse chimeras, the use                of chimeric human embryos that has been done, that you say there's                no reason that these things should have been done.  I mean, there's                no scientific basis for this.                 And we have to have some degree — and I'm not going to call                it regulation, I don't like that term, obviously, but there                has to be some consensus as to what should be permitted and shouldn't                be permitted in almost a global way.  And I realize that this is                very, very difficult.                 I've been to two G-6/G-7 meetings in which we have tried to                get some kind of consensus even on human cloning among countries.                 I mean, let alone the use of embryos for research, and things like                this.  And as you can imagine, nothing much happens.  Everyone has                their own opinions, and we go away.                 When we have the capability — if this work is successful — I'll                be frank with you.  If this work is successful, and by success that                we are learning mechanisms around differentiation and the development                of cell types, we are going to have an awful power that we can instruct                ourselves.                 Now, we're not necessarily going to be talking about germ                line cells or germ line modifications.  Maybe.  Because, obviously,                if we can grow oocytes from these cells — there are reports that                we can grow spermatogonia and sperm cells out of these — maybe the                possibility exists for that at this point.                 But I'm just hoping that people are thinking ahead a bit,                that, you know, this is something that's going to be on the                table in a number of years, and that we should give it some thought                — where we're going to go with this.  That's all.                 And so I made a comment about, you know, getting it off the internet                or something to do it.  Maybe that's an overstatement.  Maybe                that's just crying wolf, and I apologize for that.                 But I think it's something that we have to be aware is out                there.  It's going to be out there.  Not out there now, but                will be out there, and we should be thinking ahead.  So I apologize                to the Council for making that kind of a comment.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I don't think an apology is necessary.                 I think what I'm trying to say is — my own personal view is                that the Council should be especially concerned about things that                are relatively near term.  And by ""near term,"" in such                a rapidly-moving field I think a few years is near term.  And if                you're saying, well, in 10 years' time we'll be able                to do this, we can't see that far ahead.                  DR. GEARHART:   Right.  Right.                  DR. ROWLEY:   And so that — so what kind of terms are you                talking about in terms of time?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, I'm talking not about 10 years.                 I'm talking about a shorter time interval.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.                  DR. GEARHART:   You know, Janet, I think to be honest with                you, the number of federal Blue Ribbon Panels that have been set                up, at the NIH level, the National Academy, to discuss issues that                seem to be 10 years away, recommendations were made by our leading                scientists, our leading scholars, only to be ignored.  And then,                we find ourselves in a pot once these things happen.                 And it's just, I mean, frustrating as a scientist.  It's                frustrating almost as a citizen to do this, where it seems that                the scientific community, to a certain degree, is marginalized when                it comes to making recommendations as to how we should proceed.                              And we are left, then, every time something comes up in this area                everything is thrown up in the area as to where we're going,                etcetera.  So that's the nature of the comment.  Or, I'm                sorry, that's the basis of the comment that I made.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Last comment.  Elizabeth, if you — did                you still want to say something?  You were on the queue.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I'll return to the science, and I don't                know who would like to answer this question.  But it was picking                up on the point that I think Leon did raise about asking about the                sources of adult stem cells.  And you mentioned that there's                really only one good one, or the best one, is that right.  Dr. Verfaillie's.                 And —                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think Dr. Verfaillie's is the best                characterized —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes, best characterized.                  DR. PRENTICE:   — in terms of all of these various traits.                              PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes.  So, you know, we're struck — and I                think Leon pointed this out, too — by the fact that there's                a great deal of research that's been ongoing in the last, you                know, couple of years —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  — on adults.  And yet it seems to me there's                a real problem.  And, you know, what's the problem?  Why is                there so little known?  To put it bluntly.                  You know, here's 192 publications that you cite, and why is                it so difficult?  Are these just inherently really difficult things                to work with?  Is this what it comes down to, that people who work                with adult stem cells don't really like to say that, or — sorry                to cut to the point, but I know time is of the essence.                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think one of the reasons comes back to                this difficulty in identifying which one is actually the stem cell,                how to actually purify it, isolate it.  Some of the cells seem rather                easy to isolate.  Certainly, peripheral blood is quite easier, or                the adipose-derived cells would be easy to isolate.                 But then, how do you really know that one is the stem cell?  And,                again, most of the results — the best results seem to come primarily                from these mixed populations of the bone marrow stem cells, where                they have not intentionally in many cases isolated the particular                stem cell.  Instead, they've been geared towards some sort of                physiological endpoint.                 My assumption would be, then, working back from that, once they                could achieve that end point, then they might be able to derive                the particular cell.                 But I think it also brings up a point I tried to raise before                in that it may not be possible, or it may not be preferable, to                try to get a particular cell.  It may be the context of these cells                with the population and their interactions, exchanging growth factors,                altering their own gene expression, and then — in the tissue milieu                — that really gives them this ability to somehow cause the repair.                               And I use that term because, again, I think in many of the instances                the research is showing that it's not direct integration and                taking on the function.  It's somehow stimulating endogenous                cells.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  So it may — are you hinting that it might be                qualitatively different from what is going on with embryonic stem                cells, when those were tried to be used?                   DR. PRENTICE:   Well, I —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I don't want to get too much into this,                but I'm just trying to understand the science here.                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes, I think that might be a good way to                put it.  It may be qualitatively different.  You know, it's                interesting Dr. Jaenisch mentioned that embryonic stem cells, in                a sense, are a tissue culture artifact.  He might just as well,                by the same definition, call Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells a tissue                culture artifact.                 And it may be that putting these cells into culture, now changing                their context, gives them some of these characteristics that are                so sought after.  Our target might be better put in terms of, what                is the physiological endpoint that we want?  Not a particular starting                cell, but how do we achieve the repair of the tissue damage?                 And, again, as I mentioned in the talk and in the paper, it may                be that it's not a particular cell that we really need.  Short                term, cellular regeneration may be our best goal.  But long term,                figuring out the particular molecular and cellular signals — and,                again, it may be a context-type signal — cell-cell context or cell-matrix                context — that actually can give us that physiological endpoint,                and so eventually going to a non-cell-based system, but a signal-based                system if you will.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh insists on a very brief comment,                and then we're —                  DR. McHUGH:   I have just two —                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — going to break.                  DR. McHUGH:   — little tiny scientific questions, but because                they are important science that we're discussed here.  The first                one really relates to Dr. Jaenisch, and that is, I wanted to know,                sir, now whether you could say that the genetic alterations and                the problematic genetic status of the fully cloned animal, whether                those genetic abnormalities would then pass on to their offspring,                and so, therefore, be a contaminant to the whole human genome legacy                from then on?  That's the one question.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Let me first clarify there are no genetic                alterations which are important.  They are all epigenetic.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right, yes.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So the experiment has been done.  You can                take two animals afflicted with large offspring syndrome and mate                them.  The offspring will be all (risk?) normal, because you send                the genome through the process of gametogenesis, which reprograms                everything in a normal way, everything is reset.                 Of course, there might be some genetic alterations which are acquired                during somatic life.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those would not be — they cannot explain                the phenotype.  They would be recessive, and so they haven't                shown up yet.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So we don't know if they would show                up.                  DR. McHUGH:   They might show up later.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Right.                  DR. McHUGH:   And secondly, to John Gearhart — John, you                whine a lot about how troublesome it is to be a scientist nowadays.                 I just want to know this.  The President made a very good Solomonic                decision and produced the cell lines for you scientists to work,                putting the ball in your court.                 Are you saying to us now you've used up all of the potential                in those cell lines, and now, because of the President's decision,                are restricted in your progress?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   You don't have to answer, and he's                over time.  But if you'd like to —                  DR. GEARHART:   I have to answer Paul.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — 15 seconds.                  DR. GEARHART:   Being a scientist is the greatest thing                in the world, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, Paul.  And                so I don't —                  DR. McHUGH:   I know that, John.  Me, too.                  DR. GEARHART:   Okay.  And I'm not here to whine.  The                funding issues are improving, and they are improving nicely here.                 Okay?  And, clearly, we can learn a lot through the lines that are                approved.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gentlemen, thank you very much.                 Look, we have a guest we've kept waiting for quite a long                time.  Would the Council, please, 10 minutes.                 Thank you all very much.                 (Applause.)

Rachel Dudley                  When most teenagers visit Washington, they make the rounds of the monuments, line up for the White House tour and marvel at the wonders of the Smithsonian.  But 15 year old Rachel Dudley is different than most kids her age.  The Michigan teen has been coping with juvenile diabetes for 11 years and had come to Washington in hopes that her own experience could help a congressional subcommittee I chair better understand the need to find a cure for this terrible disease.            In clear and courageous testimony, Rachel told the members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations what her life has been like since being diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at the age of four.  She talked about the more than 12,000 insulin injections she's received.  And she described being rushed to a hospital intensive care unit two years ago after her kidneys shut down when, as she described, she pretended she was a ""normal"" kid and neglected to manage her diabetes properly.  And she urged us to do ""whatever it takes"" to find a cure for the disease that stands between her and the""normal"" life she yearns to live.     It was a message that was echoed by many others who testified before us that day, including the actress Mary Tyler Moore, who suffers from diabetes, some of the nation's top medical researchers, and the families and physicians of some of the 16 million Americans who live everyday with this debilitating and deadly disease.        Our best medical scientists now believe that doing ""whatever it takes"" to find a cure for diabetes and a host of other life-threatening diseases means providing federal support for stem cell research.     Embryonic stem cell research involves using cells from embryos that have the ability to divide indefinitely and to develop into specialized cells.  Researchers believe these cells have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the human body, and may therefore provide cures for many diseases.  For example, scientists believe that one day embryonic stem cells may be able to grow into new heart cells that could be replaced in a person who has a failing heart.  The potential for giving and prolonging life that these embryonic stem cells possess is enormous.      The issue of federal funding for stem cell research has come into focus in Washington because President Bush decided to set aside guidelines implemented by the Clinton administration last year while he reviews the issue.  The Clinton administration guidelines had allowed federal funding of embryonic stem cell research within strict safeguards.  For example, federal funds cannot be used to actually create embryos, and federal funds can only be used to conduct research on stem cells from eggs discarded from in vitro fertilization, which would otherwise be destroyed by  fertility clinics across the country.     Support for stem cell research has come from many quarters, such as patient advocacy groups, the business community, and scientists - including the more than 75  Nobel Laureates who recently wrote to the President on this issue.   Support for this research also crosses party lines and unites those on opposite sides of the debate over abortion rights.  Senator Bill Frist (R-Tennessee), who is the only physician serving in the Senate, as well as Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and former First Lady Nancy Reagan have expressed their strong support of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.     As President Bush considers what course to take on this critical issue, I hope he will consider the words of Rachel Dudley and the countless millions of Americans who struggle with diseases that might be cured through stem cell research.                # # #                  Carl's Bio *   Photo Gallery *   Michigan Services *   Senate Activity        Press Page *   Federal Links *   Student Info *    Contact Carl"
GX035-64-4801704	"STEM CELLS IN DEVELOPMENT/REPAIR OF OROFACIAL STRUCTURES  RELEASE DATE:  February 5, 2002   RFA:  RFA-DE-02-006  PARTICIPATING INSTITUTES AND CENTERS (ICs):   National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)  ( http://www.nidr.nih.gov/ )   LETTER OF INTENT RECEIPT DATE:  March 18, 2002  APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE:  April 18, 2002  THIS RFA CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION  o Purpose of the RFA o Research Objectives o Mechanism(s) of Support o Eligible Institutions o Individuals Eligible to Become Principal Investigators o Where to send Inquiries o Submitting an Application o Peer Review Process o Review Criteria o Award Criteria o Required Federal Citations  PURPOSE  The purpose of this RFA is to foster research on embryonic and adult  stem cell biology that could facilitate the understanding of the  complex events that occur during oral, dental, and craniofacial  development.  It is envisioned that such knowledge will aid in the  development of safe and effective stem cell-based treatments for the  repair and regeneration of orofacial structures that have been  compromised by congenital disorders, diseases, and injuries.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Brief Background  Recent scientific discoveries concerning the ability of human embryonic  stem cells (ES) to proliferate in an undifferentiated state and to be  directed to develop into a wide array of cell types present  opportunities for research that aim to repair or replace cells and  restore vital functions. Exploration of these opportunities is now  possible with the release of the NIH Guidelines for Human ES Cell  Research and the availability of human cell lines through the NIH Human  ES Cell Registry.   Adult stem cells are present in many tissues of adult organisms and are  important in tissue repair and homeostasis. These cells have the  ability to self-renew (give rise to a replacement cell at each cell  division with no apparent limitation) as well as generate another cell  that is committed to differentiation in a particular tissue.  Understanding the mechanisms of stem cell renewal could provide  fundamental insights not only into the origin of multicellular  organisms, but also into regeneration of specific tissues and  elucidation of complex events such as tumorigenesis, whereby a ""cancer  stem cell"" with a similar capacity for self-renewal drives disease progression.   ES cells that are derived from embryos at the blastocyst stage may have  a broader natural potential since, during development, they normally  produce all the cells of an organism. These pluripotent cells are  characterized by nearly an unlimited self-renewal and differentiation  capacity which can give rise to many differentiated cell types  including neurons, glia, skeletal myocytes, adipocytes and haemopoietic  cells. The main difference between the embryo-derived pluripotent cells  and the so-called multipotent adult stem cells is in the number of  differentiated cell types that they can produce. This may reflect the  different origins of these cells; pluripotent stem cells are derived  from blastocyst cells, while adult stem cells are derived from somatic  cells that no longer possess the capacity to develop into the full  spectrum of cell types. The stem and precursor cells can be used for  examining mechanisms of progenitor cell differentiation and identifying  environmental signals that are specific for cell maintenance, cell  renewal and activation of differentiation pathways.   Research Objectives and Scope  In order to develop safe and effective stem cell-based treatments, it  is essential to understand the signals or cues that regulate the stem  cell capacity for self-renewal, cell fate determination, and  maintenance of orofacial tissue homeostasis throughout life. Therefore  the objectives of this RFA are to encourage research on:   o  the use of human embryonic stem cell lines listed in the NIH Human  Embryonic Stem Cell Registry. These cell lines can be used for  examining mechanisms of progenitor cell differentiation and may also  have characteristics that make them potentially useful for stem cell- based therapy;   o  progenitor cells of the orofacial ectoderm and the cranial neural  crest-derived mesenchyme, whose interaction during embryonic  development gives rise to the craniofacial tissues including teeth,  salivary glands, cartilage, bone, peripheral nerves, oral epithelium  and smooth muscle; and  o  adult stem cells in the orofacial and other body tissues (e.g., bone  marrow, fat, blood) that have the ability to give rise to oral, dental,  and craniofacial tissues and organs.  Topic areas of emphasis might include but are not limited to:   o  identification and characterization of the stem cell population(s)  in terms of molecular markers and cell lineage in oral, dental and  craniofacial tissues and organs;    o  design of conditions for maintenance, ex vivo, of cell populations  that retain their pluripotency or their multipotency;    o  use of stem cells to understand the genetic mechanisms that regulate  development of orofacial structures, the maintenance of tissues in  health and the repair or regeneration of tissues following trauma and disease;  o  development of markers that distinguish stem and progenitor  populations and gene profiles that characterize all stages of differentiation;    o  investigation of the mechanisms that regulate self-renewal of stem  cells in the oral epithelium, salivary gland, tooth structures and  other craniofacial structures (e.g., bone, cartilage, muscles and nerves);  o  use of stem cell lines to identify the environmental cues and  conditions that are required for a human embryonic stem cell to give  rise to cells that make up the different tissues of the orofacial complex;  o  identification of signals, signaling pathways components, and  transcriptional factors that regulate the fate(s) of transplanted human  stem cells and their derivatives;  o  identification, characterization, and reproduction of the  microenvironment (""niches"") of stem and progenitor cells;  o  identification of the optimal type of stem cell or stem cell  derivative for specific assays and cell therapy for orofacial diseases  and disorders;   o  use of animal model systems of oral, dental and craniofacial  diseases and disorders for screening and comparing the functional  capabilities of implanted human stem cells and their progeny.

If an  application is received after that date, it will be returned to the  applicant without review.   The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will not accept any application  in response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently  pending initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending  application.  The CSR will not accept any application that is  essentially the same as one already reviewed. This does not preclude  the submission of substantial revisions of applications already  reviewed, but such applications must include an Introduction addressing  the previous critique.  PEER REVIEW PROCESS     Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by the CSR  and responsiveness by the NIDCR.  Incomplete and/or non-responsive  applications will be returned to the applicant without further consideration.  Applications that are complete and responsive to the RFA will be  evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer  review group convened by the NIDCR in accordance with the review  criteria stated below.  As part of the initial merit review, all  applications will:  o  Undergo a process in which only those applications deemed to have  the highest scientific merit, generally the top half of the applications  under review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score o  Receive a written critique o  Receive a second level review by the NIDCR National Advisory Council.    REVIEW CRITERIA  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.   In the written comments, reviewers will be asked to discuss the  following aspects of your application in order to judge the likelihood  that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the  pursuit of these goals:  o  Significance o  Approach o  Innovation o  Investigator o  Environment     The scientific review group will address and consider each of these  criteria in assigning your application's overall score, weighting them  as appropriate for each application.  Your application does not need to  be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major  scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score.  For example,  you may propose to carry out important work that, by its nature, is not  innovative but is essential to move a field forward.  (1) SIGNIFICANCE:  Does your study address an important problem? If the  aims of your application are achieved, how do they advance scientific  knowledge?  What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts or  methods that drive this field?  (2) APPROACH:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and  analyses adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the  aims of the project?  Do you acknowledge potential problem areas and  consider alternative tactics?  (3) INNOVATION:  Does your project employ novel concepts, approaches or  methods? Are the aims original and innovative?  Does your project  challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?  (4) INVESTIGATOR: Are you appropriately trained and well suited to  carry out this work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to your  experience level as the principal investigator and to that of the other  researchers (if any)?  (5) ENVIRONMENT:  Does the scientific environment in which your work  will be done contribute to the probability of success?  Do the proposed  experiments take advantage of unique features of the scientific  environment or employ useful collaborative arrangements?  Is there  evidence of institutional support?  ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your  application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o  PROTECTIONS:  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans,  animals, or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely  affected by the project proposed in the application.  o  INCLUSION:  The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both  genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as  appropriate for the scientific goals of the research.  Plans for the  recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated. (See  Inclusion Criteria included in the section on Federal Citations, below)  o  BUDGET:  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested  period of support in relation to the proposed research.  RECEIPT AND REVIEW SCHEDULE  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:    March 18, 2002 Application Receipt Date:         April 18, 2002 Peer Review Date:                 June, 2002 Council Review:                   August, 2002 Earliest Anticipated Start Date:  September, 2002  AWARD CRITERIA  Criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o  Scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o  Availability of funds o  Programmatic priorities.   REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS  INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH: It is the policy  of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub- populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research  projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided  indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of  the subjects or the purpose of the research. This policy results from  the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT  ""NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in  Clinical Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide  for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html );  a complete copy of the updated Guidelines are available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm .   The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH  definition of clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories  in compliance with the new OMB standards; clarification of language  governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials consistent with the new  PHS Form 398; and updated roles and responsibilities of NIH staff and  the extramural community.  The policy continues to require for all NIH- defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all applications or  proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to  conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender  and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b)  investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic  group differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN  SUBJECTS: The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals  under the age of 21) must be included in all human subjects research,  conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and  ethical reasons not to include them. This policy applies to all initial  (Type 1) applications submitted for receipt dates after October 1, 1998.  All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should  read the ""NIH Policy and Guidelines"" on the inclusion of children as  participants in research involving human subjects that is available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm .  REQUIRED EDUCATION ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECT PARTICIPANTS: NIH  policy requires education on the protection of human subject  participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for  research involving human subjects.

DRAFT               the Ethics of Stem Cell Research               Paul Lauritzen                Professor, Department of Religious Studies                Director, Program in Applied Ethics                John Carroll University,                 University Heights, Ohio                                 JuLY 2003                                                  . . . the final stage is come when man by eugenics, by prenatal                  conditioning, and by an education and propaganda based on perfect                  applied psychology, has obtained full control over himself. Human                  nature will be the last part of nature to surrender to man. (Lewis,                  1947)                 This sudden shift from a belief in Nurture, in the form of social                  conditioning, to Nature, in the form of genetics and brain physiology                  is the great intellectual event, to borrow Nietzsche’s term,                  of the late twentieth century. (Wolfe, 2001)                             I begin with passages from an unlikely pair of authors because                although C. S. Lewis and Tom Wolfe are somewhat distant in time,                certainly different in temperament, and extravagantly different                in personal style, they share an imaginative capacity to envision                the possible consequences of modern technology. The technology that                occasioned Lewis’s reflections?“the aeroplane, the wireless,                and the contraceptive” may now seem quaint, but his warning                about turning humans into artifacts, that accompanied the passage                quoted above, is eerily prescient. Similarly, although he does not                directly take up stem cell research, Tom Wolfe’s reflections                on brain imaging technology, neuropharmacology, and genomics are                worth noting in relation to the future of stem cell research. In                his inimitable way, Wolfe summarizes his view of the implications                of this technology in the title of the essay from which the above                passage comes. “Sorry,” he says, “but your soul                just died.”                The point of beginning with Lewis and Wolfe, then, is not that I                share their dire predictions about the fate to which they believe                technology propels us; instead, I begin with these writers because                they invite us to take an expansive view of technology. I believe                that such a perspective is needed and is in fact emerging in recent                work on stem cell research. This is not to say that the sort of                traditional analysis that has framed much of the debate on stem                cells, analysis that involves issues of embryo status, autonomy,                and informed consent, for example, is unhelpful; far from it. Nevertheless,                traditional moral analysis of stem cell research is nicely complemented                by a consideration of the “big picture” questions that                Lewis and Wolfe both wish to press. This report will therefore seek                to draw attention to the literature on stem cell research that attends                both to the narrow and to the expansive bioethical issues raised                by this research.                                The Moral Status of the Embryo                  There is little doubt that public reflection on stem cell research                  in the United States has been affected by the extraordinarily                  volatile cross-currents of the abortion debate. Although I will                  indicate below several reasons why framing the stem cell debate                  as a subset of that on abortion is problematic, nevertheless,                  in its current form, stem cell research is debated in terms dictated                  by the abortion controversy, and that has meant that questions                  about the status of the embryo have been particularly prominent. 1                   For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)                  described the ethical issues raised by stem cell research as “principally                  related to the current sources and/or methods of deriving these                  cells” (NBAC, 1999, 45). A policy brief from the American                  Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) begins its discussion                  of the ethical dispute over stem cell research by citing the disagreement                  over the status of the embryo as the decisive variable leading                  to fundamentally different views on this research (AAAS, 1999,                  11). The National Academy of Sciences’s report on stem cell                  research claims that “the most basic [ethical] objection                  to embryonic stem cell research is rooted in the fact that such                  research deprives a human embryo of any further potential to develop                  into a complete human being” (National Academy of Sciences,                  2002, 44). The Ethics Advisory Board of the Geron Corporation                  lists the moral status question as the first moral consideration                  relevant to deciding the acceptability of stem cell research (Geron                  Corporation Ethics Advisory Board, 1999, 32). The list could go                  on.                                    Despite the fact that these statements all insist on the importance                  of the status question, they also recognize that the debate about                  the status of the early embryo is not new and that the controversy                  over stem cell research does not, strictly speaking, raise novel                  issues in this regard. Indeed, it is probably best to place the                  initial skirmishes over stem cell research in the context of moral                  debates about human embryo research generally. In fact, it is                  worth noting that the report of the NIH Human Embryo Research                  Panel (HERP), published in 1994, explicitly identified the isolation                  of human embryonic stem cells as one of thirteen areas of research                  with preimplantation embryos that might yield significant scientific                  benefit and that should be considered for federal funding (See                  NIH HERP, 1994, ch. 2).                                    Although the recommendations of the HERP were never implemented,                  the fact that a high-profile panel reviewed  ex utero                   preimplantation human embryo research and explicitly endorsed                  stem cell research, meant that the panel report would affect the                  policy debate about stem cell research, even though its recommendation                  that the derivation and use of stem cells be federally funded                  was not adopted. For one thing, the panel’s anticipatory                  support for stem cell research assured that when human stem cells                  were actually derived several years later, the debate that ensued                  would be tied to the abortion controversy. As members of the HERP                  panel have made clear, from the start, the work of the panel was                  embroiled in controversy. For example, shortly after the HERP                  was impaneled, thirty-two members of Congress wrote to Harold                  Varmus, the director of NIH, to complain about the composition                  of the panel. A lawsuit was filed in an attempt to prevent the                  panel from meeting, and members of the panel received threatening                  letters and phone calls (Green, 1994; Tauer, 1995; Hall, 2003).                                    Given the pro-life opposition to the HERP panel and its recommendations,                  it is no real surprise that initial reactions to the prospect                  of human stem cell research fell out along the fault lines of                  abortion politics in the country. By and large, individuals and                  groups opposed to abortion tended to be opposed to stem cell research,                  and individuals and groups supportive of legalized abortion tended                  to support stem cell research.  2                   For example, the testimony that Richard Doerflinger, the principal                  spokesperson for the U.S. Catholic bishops on pro-life matters,                  offered before the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor,                  Health, and Education in 1998 was substantially the same as that                  he offered before the HERP in 1994 on stem cell research (Doerflinger,                  1998, 1994). In both cases, the fundamental issue was the status                  of the embryo. Given Catholic teaching that the embryo must be                  treated as a person from conception, no experimentation on the                  embryo can be allowed that would not also be allowed on infants                  or children. Hence, the Catholic church treats stem cell research                  as it has treated previous issues involving the destruction of                  human embryos; it is condemned as morally abhorrent.                                     In similar fashion, the arguments reviewed by the HERP panel that                  supported embryo research generally in 1994, were mobilized again                  four years later when stem cell research was the specific point                  of contention; and again the focal point was embryo status. Consequently,                  just as the HERP report opted for a “pluralistic”                  view of the embryo that emphasized its developmental potential,                  so, too, did the NBAC endorse the idea that the early embryo deserves                  respect, but is not to be treated fully as a person. 3                                     Moreover, the fact that the HERP defended its support of stem                  cell research by stressing the developmental capacity of the embryo                  also shaped the trajectory of much subsequent support for this                  work, because insisting on respect for the embryo but denying                  its personhood meant explaining how one could respect the embryo                  while nevertheless destroying it. Daniel Callahan, for example,                  posed this problem very strongly in response to the HERP report.                  If “profound respect” for the embryo is compatible                  with destroying it, he asked, “What in the world can that                  kind of respect mean?” It is, he says, “an odd form                  of esteem?at once high-minded and altogether lethal” (Callahan,                  1995). Callahan was not alone in raising this issue and attempts                  to answer his question continue to appear in the literature (See                  Lebacqz, 2001; Meyer and Nelson, 2001; Ryan, “Creating Embryos,”                  2001; Steinbock, 2001, 2000).                                    In retrospect, then, it seems that the HERP report served almost                  as choreography for the initial debates about stem cell research,                  and, as a result, the steps in the debate closely followed those                  that are familiar from the abortion controversy (On this point,                  see Hall 2003). The upshot, in my view, is that much of the debate                  has been too narrowly focused and has a kind of repetitive and                  rigid quality to it. As I noted above, for example, the Catholic                  church has repeatedly claimed that the central issue raised by                  stem cell research is that it involves the destruction of human                  embryos, embryos it believes should be treated as persons. 4                   For that reason, the rhetoric with which the Catholic church condemns                  embryonic stem cell research closely parallels that used to condemn                  abortion. Yet, because the American bishops do not want to be                  perceived as anti-science, they have also repeatedly and uncritically                  praised adult stem cell research, even though there are good reasons,                  given Catholic concerns about social justice, to be concerned                  about the pursuit of adult stem cell research. I will return to                  this point below, but for now I wish simply to note that much                  of the opposition to embryonic stem cell work has resembled Catholic                  opposition in being circumscribed by questions of embryo status,                  narrowly construed.                                     A similar constriction, however, is also apparent in the preoccupations                  of supporters of stem cell research. Just as opponents of this                  research have ritualistically condemned the destruction of early                  embryos but uncritically celebrated adult stem cell work, supporters                  of embryonic stem cell research have typically insisted on using                  embryos left over from IVF procedures, while repudiating the use                  of embryos created solely for research. Indeed, insisting on the                  distinction between so-called “spare” embryos and                  “research” embryos and endorsing only the use of spare                  embryos has been one way that supporters of embryo research have                  tried to demonstrate their “respect” for the embryo.                  Yet, it is worth asking whether the spare embryo/research embryo                  distinction does not, to borrow Daniel Callahan’s image,                  provide a kind of “wafting incense” to mask what supporters                  still find a disquieting smell (Callahan, 1995). 5                                                       Although the debate about stem cell research might have been framed                  in terms of the abortion controversy in any event, the HERP report                  insured that the initial debate over stem cell work that followed                  in aftermath of the public announcement of the work of John Gearhart                  (Shamblott et al., 1998) and James Thomson in 1998 (Thomson et                  al.) would be navigated in the wake of the conflict over abortion.                  As I indicated, the upshot is that the discussion about stem cell                  research has been more cramped than it might otherwise have been.                  The discussion has been too focused on the details of embryological                  development; too focused on the differences between those who                  view the early embryo as a person and those who do not; and far                  too individualistically oriented. Before turning to ways that                  the debate might be become less cramped, let me focus more concretely                  on these difficulties.                                    The point about the debate being framed too individualistically                  is nicely illustrated in an article on abortion by Lisa Sowle                  Cahill entitled “Abortion, Autonomy, and Community”                  (Cahill, 1996). Cahill begins this article by claiming that, in                  discussing the morality of abortion, there is no way to avoid                  the question of the status of the fetus. Nevertheless, she says,                  the debate about fetal status is almost always conducted with                  the goal of determining the rights involved, where rights are                  understood very individualistically. To the degree that the fetus                  is acknowledged to have rights, those rights are pitted against                  the rights of the pregnant women. Although Cahill doubts that                  we can jettison the use of rights language altogether, if we are                  going to use rights language, she says, we must “remove                  that language from the context of moral and political liberalism”                  (361). If we do so, we might be able to see that we have duties                  and obligations to which we do not explicitly consent. As Cahill                  puts it, “such obligations originate simply in the sorts                  of reciprocal relatedness that constitutes being a human”                  (361). 6  For example, moving                  away from an individualistic liberal view of the pregnant woman                  as primarily or exclusively an autonomous moral agent might lead                  us to recognize the obligations that individuals and communities                  have to support her during and after a burdensome pregnancy (363).                                    We do not need to accept Cahill’s commitment to the Catholic                  common good tradition to recognize the truth in her conclusion                  that pitting the rights of the fetus against the rights of the                  pregnant woman individualistically construed leads us to overlook                  important social dimensions of the problem of abortion. It seems                  to me that much the same dynamic is evident in the stem cell research                  debate.                                    Consider again the central argument that the Catholic church has                  made against stem cell research. The Pontifical Academy for Life                  suggests that the fundamental ethical issue is whether it is morally                  licit to produce or use human embryos to derive embryonic stem                  cells. The reasoning the Academy provides for concluding it is                  not licit is worth reproducing in full. The Academy lists five                  points:                  1. On the basis of a complete biological analysis, the living                  human embryo is — from the moment of the union of the gametes                  — a  human subject  with a well defined identity,                  which from that point begins its own  coordinated, continuous                  and gradual development , such that at no later stage can                  it be considered as a simple mass of cells.                                     2. From this it follows that as a “ human individual ”                  it has the  right  to its own life; and therefore every                  intervention which is not in favor of the embryo is an act which                  violates that right. . . .                                    3. Therefore, the ablation of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the                  blastocyst, which critically and irremediably damages the human                  embryo, curtailing its development, is a  gravely immoral                   act and consequently is  gravely illicit .                                     4.  No end believed to be good,  such as the use of stem                  cells for the preparation of other differentiated cells to be                  used in what look to be promising therapeutic procedures,  can                  justify an intervention of this kind . A good end does not                  make right an action which in itself is wrong.                                     5. For Catholics, this position is explicitly confirmed by the                  Magisterium of the Church which, in the Encyclical  Evangelium                  Vitae , with reference to the Instruction  Donum Vitae                   of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, affirms: “The                  Church has always taught and continues to teach that the result                  of human procreation, from the first moment of its existence,                  must be guaranteed that unconditional respect which is morally                  due to the human being in his or her totality and unity in body                  and spirit: The human being is to be respected and treated as                  a person from the moment of conception; and therefore from that                  same moment his rights as a person must be recognized, among which                  in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human                  being to life’”(No. 60). (Pontifical Academy for Life,                  2000; emphasis in original)                              Notice that the core of the argument, namely points one and two,                is framed in terms of the rights of the individual embryo. We have                seen this emphasis already in noting Richard Doerflinger’s                various statements on stem cell research. Yet, notice also the claim                that we know the embryo to be an individual with rights on the basis                of “a complete biological analysis.” This is not, of                course, the first time that the Catholic church has made this claim.                In the Declaration on Procured Abortion, the Congregation for the                Doctrine of the Faith claimed that “modern genetic science”                confirms the view that “from the first instant, the programme                is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual-man                with his characteristic aspects already well determined” ( Congregation ,                “Declaration on Procured Abortion,”1974, 13). The Instruction                on reproductive technology,   Donum Vitae , also                makes this claim. “The conditions of science regarding the                human embryo provide a valuable indication for discerning by the                use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance                of a human life: how could a human individual not be a human person?”                ( Donum Vitae , 13).                                 One reason the Catholic church has played such a major role in framing                the stem cell debate is that, in defending its position, it combines                the two claims we have just noted, neither of which is explicitly                religious. First, the early embryo is an individual person with                rights and, second, the fact that the embryo is an individual person                is confirmed by modern science. Indeed, a fair amount of the literature                that supports embryo research generally can be read as an attempt                to answer the question posed in  Donum Vitae : How                can a human individual not be a human person?                                Certainly Catholic writers who reject the church’s teaching                on the status of the embryo have responded directly to that question                (See Cahill, 1993; Farley, 2001; McCormick, 1994; Shannon, 2001;                Shannon and Walter, 1990), but so too have non-Catholics. For example,                in a statement issued by their ethics committee, what was then called                the American Fertility Society rejected the claim in  Donum Vitae                 that science supports the personhood of the embryo. According to                the ethics committee “. . . it remains fundamentally inconsistent                to assign the status of human individual to the human zygote or                early pre-embryo when compelling biological evidence demonstrates                that individuation, even in a primitive biologic sense, is not yet                established. Thus, homologues (identical) twins may result from                spontaneous cleavage of the pre-embryo at some point after fertilization                but prior to the completion of implantation. Furthermore, during                very early development, an embryo is not clearly established and                awaits the differentiation between the trophoblast and the embryoblast”                (American Fertility Society, 1988, 3S).                                Arguably, writers like Mary Anne Warren and Bonnie Steinbock, who                distinguish between biological or genetic humanity and moral humanity,                are also at least indirectly answering the question posed in  Donum                Vitae  (Warren, 1997; Steinbock 2001, 1992). Yet, whether writers                are responding more or less directly to Catholic discourse, or not                at all, the important point is that the stem cell debate has been                remarkably preoccupied with the question of whether the early embryo                is an individual person and whether and how the minute details of                embryological development help us to answer this question. This                is one reason why a fair amount of the ethics literature on the                topic reads like a textbook on embryology.                                I want to be clear here: I am not suggesting that the details of                embryological development are unimportant. The maxim from the field                of research ethics applies here as well: bad science is bad ethics.                My point is rather that the preoccupation with the details of early                embryogenesis may lock us even more rigidly into an individualistic                human rights framework than we are in debates about abortion. It                also leads us to frame the debate as fundamentally about one question,                and, indeed, it tempts us to treat the question as if there is one                and only one answer. In this frame of mind, once we have that answer,                there is not a lot more to talk about. Either the early embryo is                a person with the right to life, in which case embryonic stem cell                research is wrong, or the early embryo is not a person with rights,                and then there is no moral reason to object to stem cell work. Gene                Outka has made a similar point in his assessment of stem cell literature.                As Outka puts it, in its starkest form, the crystallizing question                is whether it is cogent to claim that embryonic stem cell research                is morally indistinguishable from murder (Outka, 184). The problem                with framing the question this way, he says, is that it “encourages                an unfortunate tendency to restrict evaluative possibilities to                a single either/or. Either one judges abortion and the destruction                of embryos to be  transparent  instances of treating fetuses                and embryos as mere means to other’s ends, or one judges abortion                and embryonic stem cell research to be,  in themselves ,                morally  indifferent  actions that should be evaluated  solely                 in terms of the benefit they bring to others.” (Outka, 2002,                184).                                The frame of human rights reinforces this either/or because, as                I noted, a being is either a rights-bearing entity or it is not.                I have argued elsewhere, that this either/or tends to drive people                to the extremes. Either the embryo is a person or it is essentially                a kind of property (Lauritzen, 2001). Although I will not rehearse                the argument for rejecting the two extremes here, it is worth noting                that the rhetoric associated with each extreme does not appear to                match the practice of those who adopt the rhetoric or in fact to                match the considered moral judgments of most Americans on these                issues.                                I can illustrate my point in relation to the view that the early                embryo is a person with the right to life by describing a cartoon                that hangs on my office door (See appendix A). The cartoon depicts                protestors in front of a stem cell research lab condemning those                who work there as being anti-life. Down the street at the abortion                clinic, the workers are noting how quiet things have gotten at their                facility since the stem cell lab opened. The point of the cartoon,                of course, is that we may soon see protests and demonstrations of                the sort that are common at abortion clinics at facilities that                conduct stem cell research and that there is an irony in the fact                that pro-life advocates would be demonstrating against research                being done to find treatments for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,                and other devastating illnesses. This is not entirely fair to the                pro-life community, but it makes a point.                                In fact, I do not have trouble imaging protestors picketing stem                cell research facilities for, as we just noted, when stem cell research                and abortion are evaluated together and when the evaluative option                is a single either/or, then abortion and stem cell research may                appear indistinguishable from murder. Certainly the rhetoric of                someone like Richard Doerflinger has been consistent in condemning                both abortion and stem cell research as equivalent to murder. The                cartoon draws attention to this consistency, even while it questions                the commitment of pro-life advocates to scientific research designed                to promote the quality of life.                                In one sense, then, the cartoon probes whether there is an inconsistency                between being pro-life and opposed to research an Alzheimer’s                disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other devastating illnesses.                I do not myself think that there is any inconsistency in being pro-life                and opposed to stem cell research, but the cartoon does point in                the direction of a fairly significant disconnect between the rhetoric                and the reality of those opposed to stem cell research because they                believe the early embryo is a person. To see this point, imagine                that, instead of a stem cell clinic, the cartoon depicted on IVF                clinic down the block from the abortion clinic and that the workers                at the abortion clinic are noting how quiet things have gotten since                the IVF clinic opened. The dramatic tension that made the original                cartoon funny would be missing from our revised cartoon precisely                because it is hard to imagine protestors disrupting the work at                IVF clinics. To be sure, the Catholic church and others have argued                that IVF is morally wrong, but the rhetoric condemning IVF is exceptionally                muted compared to that condemning abortion or stem cell research.                Nor has there been a concerted effort to put an end to IVF practice                in this country as there has been in the case of abortion and stem                cell research. Yet, if the embryo is a person from conception, then                participating in IVF as it is practiced in this country, when early                embryos are routinely frozen or discarded or both, is to be complicit                with murder. Why, then, are there no organized efforts to shut down                IVF clinics in this country?  7                                Indeed, opponents of stem cell research and cloning often write                as if these technologies raise the haunting specter of human embryo                research for the first time. The reality, of course, is that the                existence of in vitro fertilization depended entirely on embryo                research and that every variation or innovation in IVF protocols                involves experimentation on human embryos. Carol Tauer is one of                the few scholars who has pressed this point. As Tauer sees it:                                              . . . the entire history of the research leading to the first                  successful IVF is the history of attempts to fertilize oocytes                  in the laboratory. Eventually these attempts succeeded, and the                  first IVF baby was born, followed by thousands of others in the                  ensuing decades.                              The ethics literature contains scholarly discussions as to whether              it is ethically permissible to make use of medical advances that result              from unethical research. This discussion sometimes focuses on medical              research conducted by the Nazis in concentration camps and institutions              for retarded, mentally ill, and handicapped persons. Yet I have never              seen reference to reproductive technologies in this context. If the              fertilization of embryos in research is a practice that is abhorrent              to many or most people, then would it not be logical to question the              continuing use of the results of such research? (Even the Catholic              Church, which opposes the use of IVF and most other forms of assisted              reproduction, does not invoke this argument to support its opposition.)              (Tauer, 2001, 153)               If the embryo research associated with IVF points to a problem                of consistency for those who oppose stem cell research because it                involves destroying persons, it is no less problematic for those                who support stem cell research but insist on respecting the embryo                and embrace the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos. For as Tauer points out, Robert Edwards, the scientist                involved in the first successful IVF procedure, began studying fertilization                nearly thirty years before Louise Brown was born in 1978, and the                first successful laboratory fertilization of human eggs took place                a full ten years before she was born. Tauer quotes Edwards’                report on this work: “We fertilized many more eggs and were                able to make detailed examinations of the successive stages of fertilization.                We also took care to photograph everything because we would have                to persuade colleagues of the truth of our discoveries” (Tauer,                154). 8  Nor was the creation of                these “research” embryos done secretly: Edwards and                Steptoe published their work in the journal,  Nature  in                1970 (Edwards, Steptoe, and Purdy, 1970).                                At the very least, then, there is something of an irony in the fact                that so much attention has been devoted to developing and defending                the distinctions between embryos created solely for research and                embryos left over from IVF procedures, because there would be no                embryos left over from IVF procedures had there not been embryos                created solely for research purposes to develop IVF in the first                place. Given this fact, and given that this fact is no great secret?even                though it has not been discussed very much?it appears disingenuous                to endorse the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos as a way of demonstrating respect for the early embryo while                nevertheless encouraging its destruction.                                I have suggested that the fact that so much of the stem cell debate                has been framed in terms of whether the embryo is a person with                rights has been unfortunate because it has cast the debate in sharply                individualistic terms and has led to a preoccupation with embryological                development narrowly construed. In addition, however, framing the                debate in terms of embryo status and embryo rights tends to exaggerate                the differences among commentators in contrast to their similarities.                Consider, for example, the response of conservative Judaism in the                United States to this issue. Rabbi Elliot Dorff has prepared a responsum                on stem cell research for the Rabbinical Assembly Committee on Jewish                Law and Standards, and his responsum is instructive. 9                                                 As responsa are, it is structured in terms of relevant questions:                in this case, two questions frame Dorff’s discussion. First,                “may embryonic stem cells from frozen embryos originally created                for purposes of procreation or embryonic germ cells from aborted                fetuses be used for research?” (Dorff, 2002, 1). Second, “may                embryonic stem cells from embryos created specifically for research,                either by combining donated sperm and eggs in a petri dish or by                cloning be used for research?” (1) I think it is noteworthy                that the very questions that frame Dorff’s analysis both reflect                and perpetuate a certain construction of the issue, but at this                juncture, my point is different: given the way the debate has been                framed, what most (non-Jewish) readers of Dorff’s analysis                are likely to focus on is the difference between his treatment of                the early embryo and that of others in the literature. Indeed, even                where you might expect to find?and do in fact find on closer inspection?similarities                between this Jewish analysis and Catholic reflection on this issue,                the first impression will be that of difference. The reason, of                course, is that our attention is drawn to Dorff’s analysis                of the early embryo, and Jewish views are sharply different about                embryo status than those of the Catholic church and other pro-life                opponents of stem cell work. 10                                For example, Dorff points out that, according to the Talmud, during                the first forty days of gestation, the embryo and the fetus are                considered as simply water. From the forty-first day until birth,                Jewish tradition considers the fetus as “the thigh of its                mother.” Moreover, says Dorff:                              As it happens, modern science provides good evidence to support                the Rabbis’ understanding. As Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits noted                long ago, the Rabbis’ “forty days” is, by our                obstetrical count, approximately fifty-six days, for the Rabbis                counted from the woman’s first missed menstrual flow, while                doctors today count from the point of conception, which is usually                about two weeks earlier. By 56 days of gestation by obstetrical                count the basic organs have already appeared in the fetus. Moreover,                we now know that it is exactly at eight weeks of gestation that                the fetus begins to get bone structure and therefore looks like                something other than liquid. Indeed, the Rabbis probably came to                their conclusion about the stages of development of the fetus because                early miscarriages indeed looked like “merely water,”                while those from 56 days on looks like a thigh with flesh and bones.                (16)                            The contrast with Catholic teaching could hardly be more striking.              Not only are Jewish views of the status of the early embryo notably              different, but Jewish tradition claims scientific validation for its              view of the embryo, just as Catholic tradition does. Not surprisingly,              therefore, where Dorff answers both questions posed by the responsum              in the affirmative, Catholic tradition would answer both negatively.                            These differences are significant and must be attended to, but it              is worth asking whether focusing on these differences does not obscure              important similarities. Consider some of the similarities. In sketching              the Jewish view of stem cell research, Dorff notes that certain theological              commitments are central. He lists at least three that would be strikingly              similar to Catholic and other Christian theological commitments.                               Our bodies are not ours; they belong to God and God commands                  that we seek to preserve life and health.                                 All human beings, regardless of ability or disability are created                  in the image of God and are therefore to be valued as such.                                  Humans are not God. We are finite and fallible and this fact                  ought to promote humility and urge caution.                            Now if we focused merely on questions of embryo status, we would miss              entirely these similarities between Catholic and Jewish views. More              importantly, we would miss the fact that these similarities may underwrite              significant moral reflection on stem cell research that is not rooted              in concerns about the early embryo.                            For example, Dorff notes that, given Jewish theological and legal              commitments, the provision of health care must be understood as a              communal responsibility. Thus, access to therapies developed through              stem cell research is a crucial issue of justice for the Jewish community.              This theme is echoed in Laurie Zoloth’s work on stem cell research.              As Zoloth puts it:                             Research done always will mean research foregone. Will this research              help or avoid the problem of access to health, given that poverty              and poor health are so desperately intertwined in this country? .              . . How can difficult issues of global justice and fair distribution              be handled in research involving private enterprise? (Zoloth, 2001,              238)                            Surely these are questions that any Catholic moral theologian would              gladly press.                            Indeed, attending to the similarities between Zoloth’s work              and Catholic reflection on stem cell research brings us back to Lisa              Cahill’s observation about debates on abortion: they tend to              be too focused on questions of rights individually construed. When              one shifts the frame of analysis, new and different issues and new              and different ways to approach the same issues come into view. Notice,              for example, how close Zoloth and Cahill are on the issue of rights.              According to Zoloth, Jewish tradition foregrounds questions of “obligations,              duties, and just relationships to the other, rather than the protection              of rights, privacy, or ownership of the autonomous self” (96).              This leads Zoloth to ask: “Can the interests of the vulnerable              be heard in our debate?” (105). To be sure, the American bishops              have wanted to emphasize the vulnerability of the early embryo when              they have asked this question, but Catholic tradition, like Jewish              tradition, requires that we ask this question in a way that is not              captured when moral emphasis is merely about individual rights and              personal autonomy.                            Or consider another shared sensibility that emerges if we move away              from questions of embryo status, namely a wariness about the human              tendency to hubris and overreaching. Zoloth put this point eloquently              in relation to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. She notes              a rabbinic midrash on this text: “when a worker was killed,              no one wept, but when a brick fell, all wept.” Zoloth comments              on this midrash as follows:                               It was this decentering of the human and reification of the thing                that was the catastrophe that felled the enterprise . . . It is                not just that they breached a limit between what is appropriate                to create and what is not, the process of the creation must be carefully                mediated, with deep respect for persons over the temptations of                the enterprise. Such a text elaborates on the tension between repairing                the world . . . and acts that claim that the world is ours to control                utterly (Zoloth, 2001, 106-107).               Beyond Questions of Embryo Status              This passage from Zoloth helps to illustrate the point I wish to make              in arguing that the stem cell debate has been too focused on questions              of embryo status and that we must move beyond status questions if              we are fully to do justice to the moral questions raised by technological              developments associated with stem cell work. For concern about human              efforts utterly to control the world is not a moral worry narrowly              tied to status questions.                            Let me put this point in the form of a question that has not typically              been asked in the stem cell debate: Is adult stem cell work as unproblematic              as it is often assumed to be? That this is a productive question is              suggested by testimony of Francis Collins before the President’s              Council on Bioethics in December 2002. Collins was asked to speak              about the topic, “genetic enhancements: current and future prospects”              and he specifically addressed the issue of pre-implantation genetic              diagnosis (PGD). Although PGD is usually understood to involve screening              IVF embryos and discarding unwanted ones, it is also possible to screen              gametes. Because gamete screening may not have broad utility, Collins              did not discuss the issue at length. He did, however, offer an interesting              observation about gamete selection. Focusing on gametes, he says,              is useful because it “isolates you away from some of the other              compelling arguments about moral status of the embryo and allows a              sort of cleaner discussion about what are the social goods or evils              associated with broad alterations in the sex ratio and inequities              in access to that technology” (Collins, 2002, 7). In other words,              if in the future we could screen gametes in the same way that we can              now screen embryos, most of the moral issues raised by PGD would apply              to gamete screening, even though gametes are not embryos. Might we              not make a similar claim about embryonic and adult stem cell research?              Do not many of the most pressing issues raised by embryonic stem cell              technology remain when our focus is adult stem cell work rather than              embryonic stem cell research?                            The fact that we do not immediately answer yes to this question, is              testament to how decisively the debate about abortion has structured              the stem cell debate. Nevertheless, we need to see that the answer              to this question is yes and we need to see why.                             Although I will not try to address all of the issues raised jointly              by embryonic and adult stem cell research, it is worth highlighting              several that I think require fuller discussion?particularly with respect              to adult stem cell work?than they have yet received.                             Commodification Issues              Moral concerns about the commodification of gametes and embryos have              been discussed extensively in the bioethics literature both in relation              to reproductive technology and in connection with embryonic stem cell              work (See Andrews and Nelkin, 2001; Annas, 1998; Corea, 1986; Radin,              1996; Resnik, 2002; Ryan,  Ethics and Economics , 2001). Suzanne              Holland, for example, has discussed the growing commodification of              the human body in the biotech age. She cites a series of articles              published in the Orange County Register that documents a vast for-profit              market in human body tissue (Holland, 2001, 266). The  Register’s               investigative reporters documented that most nonprofit tissue              banks obtain tissue from cadavers donated by family members of the              deceased for altruistic reasons. Most relatives are not told, and              in fact have no idea, that donated body parts will be sold for profit.              As Holland puts it:                               The “gift of life” is big business in America. For a                nonprofit tissue bank, one typical donation can yield between $14,000                and $34,000 in downstream sales, sometimes far more than that. “Skins,                tendons, heart valves, veins, and corneas are listed at about $110,000.                Add bone from the same body, and one cadaver can be worth about                $220,000.” Four of the largest nonprofit tissue banks told                the Orange County Register that together they expected to produce                sales totaling $261 million in 2000. (226)                              Nor is the issue of downstream commodification restricted to the                sale of donated cadaveric tissue; it arises in relation to IVF embryos                donated for research. As Dorothy Nelkin and Lori Andrews point out                in their book,  Body Bazaar,  IVF patients are not generally                told what the research involving their donated embryos will include.                Many will be unaware that their embryos will be used to develop                commercial stem cell lines (Nelkin and Andrews, 2001, 35).                                 It is significant that even the most vocal advocates of procreative                liberty and laissez-faire arrangements in reproductive matters recoil                from the prospect of selling human embryos. Yet, although the commodification                of tissue may be particularly troubling when it involves embryos,                if there is a problem with commodifying and commercializing human                tissue, it is a problem we confront with adult stem cell research                as well as with hES cell work. Lori Knowles has made a similar point                about being consistent in our moral judgments about commodifying                embryos. She notes that fears about commodifying reproduction have                led many to oppose the sale of embryos and to reject the idea that                couples who donate embryos have any proprietary interest in the                result of the research done with their embryos. As Knowles puts                it, “if it is wrong to commercialize embryos because of their                nature, then it is wrong for everyone. It is simply inconsistent                to argue that couples should act altruistically because commercializing                embryos is wrong, while permitting corporations and scientists to                profit financially from cells derived by destroying those embryos”                (Knowles, 1999, 40).                                Knowles draws attention here to the fact that there is a tension                between our moral and legal traditions as they apply to developments                brought about by cloning, stem cell research, and the existence                of ex utero human embryos, among other technological breakthroughs.                For example, we patent embryonic stem cell lines, thereby insuring                massive profits for patent holders, while decrying the commodification                of embryonic life. Knowles is correct that there is a tension between                our profit-based medical research model and our commitment to altruism                and the access to health care that a commitment to justice demands.                Adult stem cell research, of course, raises very similar issues,                because the same tension exists between the need for proprietary                control of technology and the need for affordable access. For example,                patents have been sought and granted for human adult stem cells                work as well as for embryonic stem cell technologies. According                to a study on the patenting of inventions related to stem cell research                commissioned by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New                Technologies, as of October 2001, two thousand twenty-nine patents                were applied or granted for stem cells and 512 patents were applied                or granted for embryonic stem cell work (Van Overwalle, 2002, 23;                see also McGee and Banger, 2002). As a result, access to therapies                developed from adult stem cell research is likely to be as serious                an issue as access to embryonic stem cell therapies.                                Indeed, issues arising from commodification of both adult and embryonic                stem cells are likely to dominate the next phase of the debate,                if only because corporate interest in this work, both nationally                and internationally, is so strong (Hill, 2003). Noting that, as                of 2002, “a dozen biotech companies have entered the stem                cell industry and have invested millions of dollars,” David                Resnik suggests that the next stage of the stem cell debate will                involve a battle over property rights relating to stem cells (Resnik,                2002, 130-31).                                To be sure, the battle over property rights raises important legal                and policy question, but it also raises ethical questions as well.                For example, Resnik provides the following table of possible ethical                objections to patenting stem cells.                                                                               Deontological Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                   Consequentialist Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                                                                        ES cells (and their products) should not be                      treated as property; they should be viewed as having inherent                      dignity or respect.   ES cells should not                      be treated as private property; they are  res communis                       or common property.                                        Treating ES cells as property will have dire social consequences,                      such as exploitation, destruction of altruism, and loss of                      respect for the value of human life.   Treating ES cells                      as property will undermine scientific discovery and technological                      innovation in the field of regenerative medicine. (Resnik,                      2002, 139)                                              Although the ethical objections to commodifying stem cell work                can not be sorted out as neatly as this table suggests, Resnik correctly                identifies a variety of such objections. I will not try to defend                it here, but my own view is that the problem is not just that stem                cells and their products may be commodified, but that market rhetoric                may come to dominate the discussion (and practice) of regenerative                medicine in a way that is dehumanizing. That is, market-rhetoric                may lead us ultimately to think of humans as artifacts. In short,                I take very seriously Margaret Radin’s argument that the rhetoric                in which we conceive our world affects who and what we are (Radin,                1996, 82). 11  At the same time,                however, stem cell research is most likely to bear therapeutic fruit,                if there is a market in stem cells and their products. The pressing                moral question, then, is how do we promote the benefits that stem                cell research may yield without succumbing to a market rhetoric                that reduces humans to commodities?                                Several writers have suggested that one answer may be to promote                greater governmental regulation. For example, Holland argues for                moving beyond a policy of restricting federal funding of stem cell                research but allowing an unregulated private market in this field                to active regulation to curb the private sector’s work on                stem cells. Lori Knowles suggests that the United States might adopt                a body like Canada’s Patented Medicine Prices Review Board                as a way to allow a market to function, but with oversight that                would provide access to potential cells for further research and                price controls of products to insure widespread access (Knowles,                1990, 40). George Annas has suggested that we need to establish                a federal Human Experimentation Agency to regulate in the area of                human experimentation. (Annas, 1998, 18). As Annas puts it:                                Virtually all those who have studied the matter have concluded that                a broad-based public panel is needed to oversee human experimentation                in the areas of genetic engineering, human reproduction, xenografts,                artificial organs, and other boundary-crossing experiments. (19)              Francis Fukuyama has argued that a new agency with a mandate to regulate              biotechnology on broad grounds and in both the public and private              sector may be needed (Fukuyama, 2002, 215). Vanessa Kuhn argues that              “it is time to put in place legislation that will deter stakeholders              from licensing their technology to one exclusive distributor and thus              creating a monopoly market, which would set artificially-high prices              and lead to less access for the sick especially for the uninsured,              the poor, and the elderly” (Kuhn, 2002). To that end, Kuhn identifies              four possibilities:               Development of a new kind of patent.               Set limits on exclusive licensing through compulsory licensing.                 Lower the lifespan of hES cell patents                  Set stricter guidelines for hES patent utility (2)              I do not have the expertise to make policy recommendations, but let              me stress two points. First, the policy issues with regard to commodifiying              adult stem cell work will be as vexing as those confronting regulation              of embryonic stem cells. Second, although these questions may at first              appear to be strictly legal or largely political matters, they involve              serious value judgments about the common good that are every bit as              morally vital as questions about the status of the embryo. I thus              agree with Gene Outka, that not to confront directly questions about              how stem cell research will be organized, financed, and overseen is              a kind of ethical failure (Outka, 2002, 177). Obviously, for example,              the institutional arrangements for conducting stem cell research have              implications for the questions of justice we previously noted. The              fact that so much stem cell research is being done by private corporations              insures future conflict. On the one hand, corporations have fiduciary              obligations to their shareholders and will therefore seek to control              access to stem cell lines or therapies developed from those lines              through patent protection and licensing agreements. On the other hand,              such a system is likely to further widen the gap between the health              care haves and have-nots (See Lebacqz 2001; McLean 2001).                             Moreover, as Karen Lebacqz notes, if justice is an important consideration              in deliberations about stem cell work, then it ought to shape the              research agenda. The example she gives to make this point is worth              noting. Just as with organ transplants, tissue rejection may be a              major problem for stem cell therapies. This is one reason that the              prospect of combining stem cell work with somatic cell nuclear transfer              (SCNT) has been so enticing. With this combination, you could in theory              develop tissue that would be completely histocompatible. Nevertheless,              according to Lebacqz, developing stem cell therapies with SCNT is              “highly questionable,” if justice is a primary consideration.              The reason is that unique cell lines would need to be created for              each patient, and that is likely to be very expensive and thus unaffordable              for many. Although it would certainly be less expensive, the same              would likely be true for adult stem work. For that reason, rather              than pursuing an individualized approach to stem cell research, concerns              about affordable access to new therapies might urge the pursuit of              universal donor cell lines.                             Embodiment, Boundary Issues, and Human Nature              In discussing the debate about embryo status, I focused primarily              on the contested question of whether the early embryo is a person              with the right to life. We saw that this question tends to lead to              the mobilization of minute details of embryological development to              support one’s view of the embryo. Yet, if attention to embryo              status tends to focus us on the microscopic, viewing stem cell research              through the lens of embryological development can also have a kind              of telescopic function through which larger issues come into view. 12               For example, Catherine Waldby and Susan Squier argue in a forthcoming              issue of the journal  Configurations  that focusing on stem              cells and embryonic life leads us fundamentally to question what it              means to be human. According to Waldby and Squier:                               Stem cell technologies have profound temporal implications for the                human life course, because they can potentially utilize the earliest                moments of ontogenesis to produce therapeutic tissues to augment                deficiencies in aging bodies. Hence they may effect a major redistribution                of tissue vitality from the first moments of life to the end of                life. In doing so however they demonstrate the perfect contingency                of any relationship between embryo and person, the non-teleological                nature of the embryo’s developmental pathways. They show that                the embryo’s life is not proto-human, and that the biology                and biography of human life cannot be read backwards into its moment                of origin. (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)              The claim that there is a perfect contingency in the relationship              between embryo and person may at first appear to be just another “microscopic”              claim about embryo status, but it is clear that Waldby and Squier              mean to imply much more in asserting that the embryo’s development              is non-teleological. In effect, they reject the notion that there              is a meaningful trajectory to human life. What was killed, they say,              when stem cells were first derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyte              was not a person, but a “biographical idea of human life, where              the narrative arc that describes identity across time has been extended              to include the earliest moments of ontogeny” (Waldby and Squier,              forthcoming).                             That much more is at stake here than the question of whether the embryo              is a person is clear if we attend to the notion of a trajectory of              a human life. Gilbert Meilaender, for example, has argued that our              attitudes toward death and dying are importantly shaped by our conception              of what it means to have a life (Meilaender 1993). Indeed, according              to Meilaender, two views of what it means to have a life?of what it              means to be a person?have been at war with each other within the field              of bioethics over the past thirty years and these views underwrite              sharply different views not just about the issues of abortion or euthanasia              that are implicated here but with regard to practically every moral              issue we might confront in the field of bioethics.                            On Meilaender’s view, having a life means precisely that there              is a trajectory that traces a “natural pattern” in embodied              life that “moves through youth and adulthood toward old age              and, finally, decline and death” (29). As he puts it elsewhere              in this essay, “to have a life is to be  terra animata,               a living body whose natural history has a trajectory” (31).              Although Meilaender develops the notion of a natural trajectory of              bodily life primarily to address the issue of euthanasia and not stem              cell research, his talk of “natural history,” “natural              pattern,” and “natural trajectory” draws attention              to one of the most significant issues raised by stem cell research              and related technologies. Does stem cell research undermine the very              notion of a human life constrained by natural bodily existence? The              example on which Meilaender focuses here is instructive for thinking              about the broad implications of stem cell research in this regard.              If stem cell therapies fundamentally alter our sense of a natural              pattern to aging would they not also fundamentally alter our sense              of what it means to be human? Meilaender’s answer is that such              a change would fundamentally affect what it means to be human precisely              because we are embodied creatures and for that reason our identity              is tied to the body and the body’s history.                            Leon Kass has made a similar point recently in reflecting on the prospect              that regenerative medicine might significantly lengthen the human              life span (Kass, 2003). He, too, invokes the notion of a natural trajectory,              one that stem cell research may undermine. Although it is possible              to approach the prospect of extending the human life-span in an abstract              way, he says, to think of what such a change would mean experientially              is to recognize that “the ‘lived time’ of our natural              lives has a trajectory and a shape, its meaning derived in part from              the fact that we live as links in the chain of generations”              (13). Indeed, says Kass, without something like the natural trajectory              of bodily life that currently exists, the relationship between the              generations would be decidedly different, and probably not better.              “A world of longevity,” writes Kass, “is increasingly              a world hostile to children” (13). Walter Glannon has argued              that, at the very least, increased longevity would increase competition              for scarce resources between older and younger generations. According              to Glannon, “it is at least intuitively plausible that an over              populated world with substantially extended human lives and scarce              resources could adversely affect the survival and reproductive prospects              of the young and harm them by thwarting their interest in being healthy              enough so that they could survive and procreate” (Glannon, “Extending,”              347).  13                            Francis Fukuyama has also suggested some of the reasons why increased              longevity may imperil children, but he also notes that our relationship              to death may change as well (See 2002, ch. 4). “Death,”              he says, “may come to be seen not as a natural and inevitable              aspect of life, but a preventable evil like polio or measles. If so,              then accepting death will appear to be a foolish choice, not something              to be faced with dignity or nobility” (Fukuyama, 2002, 71).                            Sometimes the question of the transformative possibilities that come              with stem cell research is raised even more starkly when the question              asked is not how may stem cell work affect what it means to be human,              but instead: Does stem cell research open the door to a post human              future? This is a point Waldby and Squier raise explicitly when they              discuss the combination of genetic engineering and stem cell therapy.              They suggest, for example, that xenotransplantation forces us to confront              the prospect of transgressing species boundaries. 14               The conclusion of their paper is worth quoting in full:                               Thus the ontological status of the embryo is not the                only thing in question. The ontological status of the graft recipient                must be negotiated, when the graft involves genetically-engineered                stem cells from another species. And the ontological status of the                illnesses to which biomedical technology responds is equally challenged,                in an endless regression, as the division between veterinary and                human medicine, or between zoonoses (diseases humans can catch from                animals) and what has recently been dubbed humanooses, is called                into question. This increasingly permeable, increasingly constructed                barrier between human and animal presents us with another form of                life to negotiate, whose boundary lies not between silicon and carbon,                but rather between steps in the evolutionary ladder?or the branching                development tree?of phylogenetic lifeforms. Stem cell technologies                thus challenge both the temporal and spatial boundaries of human                life, both our biography and our biological niche, giving a much                broader meaning to the questioning of embryonic  personhood .                (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)                            Regrettably, with some notable exceptions, the ethical debate about              stem cell research has not taken up in a sustained way what it would              mean to pursue stem cell therapies that might significantly undermine              the notion of a natural human life or erode the boundary between human              and non-human species. When the issue is framed in terms of the status              of the embryo, the question tends to be whether the research should              be conducted at all. By contrast, when the issue is framed in terms              of adult stem cell work, the question is not whether, but how and              with what consequences. Yet, that is a question we have not systematically              answered. Given the potential for good embedded in the prospects of              adult stem cell research, it is not surprising that there appears              to be widespread and largely uncritical acceptance of adult stem cell              research. But, if the promise of stem research is as revolutionary              as is often claimed, we are going to need a much more expansive discussion              of stem cell research?both embryonic and adult?than we have had heretofore.              Obviously, I cannot explore this more expansive horizon in any detail              in this report, but let me in closing suggest one direction we need              to explore.                             To signal the decisive break that I think we may need from the usual              bioethics frame, I want to draw attention to Martha Nussbaum’s              recent article in the journal  Daedalus  entitled, “Compassion              & Terror” (Nussbaum, 2003). Discussing Euripides’              play,  Trojan Women , Nussbaum reflects on the fact that the              Greek poets returned obsessively to the sacking of Troy and the acts              of the “rapacious and murderous Greeks.” She explores              the poets’ compassionate imagining of the fate of Trojan women              and children to reflect on the conditions and limits of a compassionate              vision. Although Nussbaum is ultimately concerned about engendering              a compassionate vision for Americans in the face of terror?and particularly              compassion for innocent women and children far from our shores, her              analysis of compassion is thought-provoking in relation to stem cell              research.                            Nussbaum notes that compassion is a complex emotion requiring a series              of judgments involving another person’s suffering or lack of              well-being. We must judge that someone has been harmed, that the harm              is serious, and that it was not deserved. Moreover, says Nussbaum,              Western tradition has stressed what could be called the “judgment              of similar possibilities.” In other words, “we have compassion              only insofar or we believe that the suffering person shares vulnerabilities              and possibilities with us” (Nussbaum, 2003, 15).                            Now surely in just about everyone’s catalogue of human vulnerabilities              are illness, old age, and death. Yet, as we have just seen, stem cell              research might significantly transform the “human” experience              of illness and death, at least for some. If stem cell therapies were              to erode the notion of human nature or species membership, might they              not also erode some basic moral sensibilities? Mary Midgley, for example,              has argued that both the notion of human nature and that of human              rights are importantly tied to membership in our species because rights              are “supposed to guarantee the kind of life that all specimens              of  Homo sapiens  need” (Midgley, 2000, 9).                            Although Nussbaum avoids the language of human nature, it is precisely              this sort of point that she highlights when she argues that compassion              requires the belief that others share vulnerabilities and possibilities              with us. Indeed, like Midgley, Nussbaum ties the notion of universal              human rights to important human functions and capabilities. The basic              idea, she says, is to ask what constitutes the characteristic activities              of human beings. In other words:                               ‘What does the human being do, characteristically,                as such?and not, say, as a member of a particular group, or a particular                local community?’ To put it another way, what are the forms                of activity, of doing and being, that constitute the human form                of life and distinguish it from other actual or imaginable forms                of life, such as the lives of animals and plants, or, on the other                hand, of immortal gods as imagined in myths and legends (which frequently                have precisely the function of delimiting the human)? (Nussbaum,                1995, 72)                 Nussbaum notes that this inquiry proceeds by examining a wide variety                of self-interpretations and that comparing characteristic human                activities with non-human activities and, through myths and stories,                comparing humans and the gods is particularly helpful. For one thing,                such an inquiry helps us to define limits that derive from membership                in the world of nature.                                 Indeed, although Nussbaum is particularly attentive to the wide                variety of cultural interpretations of what it means to be human,                she insists that to ground any essentialist or universal notion                of human rights, one must attend to human biology. Although her                account of the human is neither ahistorical nor a priori, it is                linked to an “empirical study of a species-specific form of                life” (1995, 75). When she develops her account of central                human capabilities, she begins with the body. She writes:               We live all our lives in bodies of a certain sort, whose                possibilities and vulnerabilities do not as such belong to one human                society rather than another. These bodies, similar far more than                dissimilar (given the enormous range of possibilities) are our homes,                so to speak, opening certain options and denying others, giving                us certain needs and also certain possibilities for excellence.                The fact that any given human being might have lived anywhere and                belonged to any culture is a great part of what grounds our mutual                recognitions; this fact, in turn, has a great deal to do with the                general humanness of the body, its great distinctness from other                bodies. The experience of the body is culturally shaped, to be sure;                the importance we ascribe to its various functions is also culturally                shaped. But the body itself, not culturally variant in its nutritional                and other related requirements, sets limits on what can be experienced                and valued, ensuring a great deal of overlap. (Nussbaum, 1995, 76)                              Nussbaum’s work both in identifying the judgments that underwrite                compassion and in tying an account of rights to human function and                capabilities that are presumably universal highlights what is at                stake, not merely with stem cell research but with a growing list                of biotechnological developments which appear to destabilize the                concept of human nature and which require that we think carefully                and hard about what it might mean for some humans to have access                to these technologies while other humans do not. 15                 At the very least, the combination of what Rabinow describes as                the biologicalization of identity around genetics rather than gender                and race with the possibility of manipulating that genetic identity                for those with the money or power to do so does not bode well for                securing wide-spread compassion across economic or technological                divides. Even more important, however, is the recognition that the                very notion of human rights may ultimately rest on the idea (and                what, until recently has always been the reality) of a natural human                condition that is relatively stable.                                I believe that Nussbaum is correct when she claims that inquiring                into characteristic human activities and comparing these to non-human                activities helps us to define limits and thereby to promote human                flourishing. Unfortunately, what Susan Squier calls the “pluripotent                rhetoric” of stem cell research is that of limitless possibilities                (Squier, Liminal Lives). The ultimate limit, of course, is death                and yet even this limit appears illusory in some visions of our                biotech future.                                It is worth noting in closing that William Safire’s New Year’s                Day column at the dawn of the twenty-first century, in January 2000,                was entitled “Why Die?” The longing behind this question                is neither new nor unfamiliar. What is new is that this longing                to escape the vulnerabilities and limitations of the body is united                with a technology that holds out the prospect of fundamentally changing                that body. Yet, I agree with Gerald McKenny that we need to ask                whether we wish to accept and promote a view of bodily vulnerability                as merely an obstacle to human flourishing, which ought to be overcome                at any cost (McKenny, 1998, 223).                                Although a longing for invulnerability is perhaps a quintessentially                human trait, and although the quest to reduce the human suffering                wrought by illness and disease is morally admirable, there is no                mistaking the hubris behind the question, Why Die? Opponents of                stem cell research have, from the start, argued that there is a                kind of idolatry in a science that would reduce the human embryo                to just so much biological material. What I have tried to show in                this report is that such concerns need not be limited to those who                think that the early embryo is fully a person. Nor should this kind                of concern be limited to those who oppose stem cell research. I                do not think the early embryo is a person and I believe that both                embryonic and adult stem cell research should go forward under a                system of strict regulation. Nevertheless, I confess to being haunted                by the passages with which I began and I believe that future debates                on stem cell research must take very seriously the worries about                commodification and the possibility of fundamentally changing the                trajectory of a human life. 16                                                                        Appendix A                                 Jimmy Margulies, Editorial Cartoonist                The Record, Hackensack, New Jersey                Cartoon used with permission of the artist.                                          _____________________                 notes                                                Given the current status of technology, deriving                  human embryonic stem cells requires destroying embryos. If the                  cells could be derived without the destruction of embryos or if                  parthenogenetically stimulated eggs produced stem cells, issue                  of status would almost certainly fade. Nevertheless, serious ethical                  issues would still remain. This is one reason I believe it is                  a mistake to focus narrowly on embryo status.                                     Gene Outka has argued that there is an “internal                  coherence” to views of the embryo, issues of complicity,                  and views on adult stem cell research (Outka, 2002).                                       Although the HERP report claimed that “it                  is not the role of those who help form public policy to decide                  which of these views [of the embryo] is correct, there is little                  doubt that the panel adopted the pluralistic view. For that reason,                  most commentators found the above claim disingenuous.                   Compare, for example,                  the various statements that Richard M. Doerflinger has made on                  the U. S. bishops’ behalf. See Doerflinger, 1988, 1998,                  1999, 2001. Margaret Farley has argued that the Catholic preoccupation                  with abortion has eroded its credibility on other important social                  issues, including stem cell research. (See Farley, 2000).                   Another debate that is                  at least partly shaped by focusing on embryo status revolves around                  the question of complicity. For example, supporters of stem cell                  research may harbor a residual uneasiness about endorsing the                  destruction of human embryos, at least if the number of articles                  in the literature explaining the concept of complicity with wrongdoing                  is any indication. John Robertson, Ronald Green, and Thomas Shannon,                  have all written on the issue of cooperation with evil in relation                  to stem cell research. (Robertson, 1999; Green, 2002; Shannon,                  2001; see also Kaveny, 2000; and Gilliam, 1997). To be sure, the                  issue of complicity or cooperation with wrongdoing is a very traditional                  one in moral philosophy and theological ethics. Still, if the                  early embryo does not deserve the respect accorded persons and                  if destroying the embryo is compatible with respecting it, then                  deriving stem cells is not an act of wrongdoing and issues of                  complicity do not arise. Cahill also emphasizes the way a liberal                  individualist view of the person discounts the significance of                  embodiment. I will return to this point below.                  Cahill also emphasizes                  the way a liberal individualist view of the person discounts the                  significance of embodiment. I will return to this point below.                                   That both                  those who view the embryo as a person and those who do not but                  who insist on respect for the embryo, have been remarkably cavalier                  with regard to the use of embryos in IVF programs can be seen                  by the fact that there are currently over 400,000 embryos frozen                  in the United States, a number we did not even know until quite                  recently (Hoffman et al. in association with The Society for Assisted                  Reproductive Technology and RAND, 2003).                   In a commentary                  published in Nature, in September 2001, Edwards writes: “On                  the verge of clinical application, stem cells offer a startlingly                  fundamental approach to alleviating severe incurable human maladies.                  Fondly believed to be a recent development, they have in fact                  been part and parcel of human in-vitro fertilization (IVF) from                  as long ago as 1962.”                  Dorff’s                  responsum was accepted by the Committee on Law and Standards by                  a vote of twenty-two to one in March 2002. On the basis of Dorff’s                  responsum the Rabbinical Assembly passed a resolution in April                  2003 supporting stem cell research for therapeutic purposes. (Resolution                  in Support of Stem Cell Research and Education, April 2003: available                  at www.rabassembly.org.)                   Alpers                  and Lo draw the distinction between commodification and commercialization                  as follows: “The issue of commodification involves treating                  either human beings or symbols of human life as merchandise or                  vendible goods. . . . Commercialization refers to the practice                  of realizing large profits from the development and sale of techniques                  or products that involve distinctive human material, such as embryos,                  eggs, or tissue” (Alpers and Lo, 1995).                  Radin                  quotes Georg Lukács on the reification of commodities and                  the effects on human consciousness. Lukács writes: “The                  transformation of the commodity relation into a thing of ‘ghostly                  objectivity’ cannot therefore content itself with reduction                  of all objects for the gratification of human needs to commodities.                  It stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man; his                  qualities and abilities are no longer an organic part of his personality,                  they are things which he can ‘own’ or ‘dispose                  of’ like the various objects of the external world”                  (Radin, 1996, 82). When we think about genes for enhancing memory                  or muscle mass, it is worth keeping in mind Lukács’s                  claim that human qualities and abilities may come to be thought                  of as objects for sale in the external world.                    Erik                  Parens has noted the importance of attending to the big picture                  raised by stem cell work and how the politics of abortion has                  obscured that picture. See Parens, 2000.                   In another                  essay, Glannon argues that substantially increasing the human                  life span would profoundly affect issues of personal identity                  and thus a sense of personal responsibility for one’s action.                  He ties his argument in interesting ways to the biology of memory                  function (Glannon, “Identity”). For a classic philosophical                  discussion of the problems associated with immortality, see Williams,                  1973.                  Although                  he is not discussing stem cell research explicitly, Paul Rabinow’s                  discussion of technological change wrought during the last two                  decades is worth noting. He writes: “In the United States,                  for example, in the last two decades, while the most passionate                  value conflicts have raged around abortion, a general reshaping                  of the sites of production of knowledge has been occurring. To                  cite the biotechnology industry, the growing stock of genomic                  information, and the simple but versatile and potent manipulative                  tools (exemplified by the polymerase chain reaction) is to name                  a few key elements; a more complete list would include the reshaping                  of American universities, the incessant acceleration in the computer                  domains, and the rise of ‘biosociality’ as a prime                  locus of identity?a biologicalization of identity different from                  the older biological categories of the West (gender, age, race)                  in that it is understood as inherently manipulable and re-formable”                  (Rabinow, 1999, 13). A couple of pages later, he writes: “My                  analysis points to the fact that the basic understanding and practices                  of ‘bare life’ have been altered. The genome projects                  (human, plant, animal, microorganismic) are demonstrating a powerful                  approach to life’s constituent matter. It is now known that                  DNA is universal among living beings. It is now known that DNA                  is extremely manipulable. One consequence among many others is                  that the boundaries between species need to be rethought; transgenic                  animals made neither by God nor by the long-term processes of                  evolution now exist (16).

Our fourth session of the day is on stem cells, moving research                from the bench to the bedside, the role of non-governmental activity.                              Progress in stem cell research proceeds not only with government                support, important though such support surely is.  Biotech companies                are vigorously active in the field both with embryonic and non-embryonic                cells, and disease related and other philanthropic foundations are                actively supporting such research.                 Our monitoring of stem cell research would not be complete without                some review of what is going on under these auspices.  This afternoon                we are fortunate to have with us representatives from two leading                biotech companies very active in stem cell research and from two                leading private philanthropic research foundations who will tell                us something about the strategies they are pursuing to develop stem                cell based experimental therapies, how close they are to developing                such therapies, and what obstacles currently stand in the way.                 As they have all been asked to avoid commercial pitches, criticisms                of competitors, or advocacy for or against legislation currently                pending before Congress, I would ask Council members to refrain                from prodding them to do otherwise or to ask them for investment                tips or other privileged information.                 (Laughter.)                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Our guests in order of presentation are                Dr. Thomas Okarma, who is the President and CEO of Geron Corporation,                a company that emphasizes embryonic stem cell research and formerly                supported the work, among others, of John Gearhart and James Thomson,                and that has solid patent positions in this field.                 Second, Dr. Theo Palmer, who is an assistant professor in the                Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford, a stem cell researcher working                on nervous system applications, and today representing the Michael                J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson Research on whose scientific advisory                board he serves.                 Third, William Pursley, President and CEO of Osiris Therapeutics,                Inc., a company in the forefront especially of mesenchymal stem                cell research, with many strong patents in this area and exploring                clinical applications for cardiac therapy, immunomodulation, among                others.                 Finally Dr. Robert Goldstein, who is the Chief Scientific Officer                of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, an organization                with extensive activities, including a recently announced program                of training grants to draw top young researchers into the stem cell                field.                 Gentlemen, thank you very much for taking time from your busy                lives to travel here and to give us the benefit of your knowledge.                              We'll start with Dr. Okarma.                  DR. OKARMA:   Thank you, Dr. Kass, for the opportunity to                spend some time with you today.  It's a visit that's probably                overdue.                 You asked me to address three topics:  our progress in the development                of products based on embryonic stem cells; our thoughts about immune                tolerance and immune rejection of the transplanted cells; and, lastly,                impacts of various policies on our progress in the private sector                in 15 minutes.  So I will be terse and not do justice to either                question, but try to give you an overall picture.                 By way of background and the take-home point, clearly human embryonic                stem cells are a special case, and this Council has certainly debated                the issue of the moral status element of that specialness.  But                I would argue that there are two other elements to its specialness.                              First, the biology which is unique amongst all the cells in the                universe and its promise for medical therapeutics.                 And thirdly and not well understood, this paradigm is in the industrial                sector, not in the academic sector, and that has some very important                implications to the development of this technology, and I'll                try to make those points as I go through.                 Geron, as you may know, has been at the forefront of human embryonic                stem cell research since 1995 when we first entered the field.                 We funded the work done in Jamie Thomson's lab, John Gearhart's                lab, and Dr. Pedersen's lab at UC-San Francisco, and as such,                we're the movers technically, technologically and proprietarily                in this entire field.                 We have spent over $70 million on this technology, most of it                since 1999 after the cells were derived.  That's a number against                which the NIH disbursements pale by both absolute and relative terms,                and there are some reasons for that that I will touch on.                 So let me move first then into our development plans and our developmental                progress.  First, let me talk a bit about some of the infrastructure                basic science components that we've established.                 You've heard a lot of discussion about how these cells are                grown on mouse feeder cells.  We've established a scalable way                to grow these cells not only off of feeder cells, but now with a                fully qualified set of reagents.  These can be scaled virtually                limitlessly.                 We've established ways to scalably produce seven different                differentiated cell types from each of the lines that we have.                 So one line now makes seven different kinds of cells that we'll                describe in a moment.                 We have verified the stability of the embryonic stem cell line                in culture.  Some of the lines have been grown continuously for                over three years, more than 600 population doublings, and there's                a manuscript in press now describing four lines studied over that                period of time that demonstrates that the karyotype, surface marker,                differentiation potential, and gene expression level, the stability                of these undifferentiated cell lines grown under our culture conditions.                              We have had a preliminary meeting with FDA, and we have now qualified                two of our cell lines for human use.  They have passed every assay                the FDA has asked us to submit them to, even though they are appropriately                classified as xenogeneic.  I will return to that later.                 In collaboration with Celera, we've established an annotated                genomic database of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.  One                hundred fifty thousand EST sequences have been sequenced, and the                physical clones are deposited in Menlo Park.                 This is fully annotated.  We can query this database.  We understand                what the gene expression pattern of stemness really is and what                genes are up and down-regulated as these cells differentiate.  That                has been a crucial foundation for our ability to learn how to produce                differentiated cell types.                 And lastly, we, too, have developed methods to genetically modify                these cells.                 Now, the cells that we have learned how to make are characterized                by their normalcy.  Virtually every cell that we have made, without                exception, expresses completely normal cell biology.  So the islet                cells we have derived express insulin, and they express insulin                in a dose-dependent fashion as a function of glucose concentration                in the media.                 The oligodendrocytes we have made myelinate spinal cord cells                in animals.                 The dopaminergic neurons we have made secrete dopamine.                 The cardiomyocytes that we have made express all of the molecular                markers consistent with their being human cardiomyocytes.  They                respond in appropriate dose response fashion to cardioactive drugs.                              The bone cells that we have made in  Roslin have absolutely normal                biology.  The techniques to look at the bone formation these cells                make  in vitro  by X-ray diffraction are absolutely spot-on                normal.                 We are close, but have not yet derived chondrocytes.  That is                also a project funded at the Roslin Institute.                 And lastly, bone marrow cells, hematopoietic progenitors, which                again are absolutely normal in their cell biology, producing all                three cell lines normally.                 Now, some of these cells have progressed into animal studies,                and I'll detail those in a moment.  The first take-home point                to make is that we have never ever seen in any single animal the                formation of a tumor.  That is because we only put in differentiated                cells.                 The issue about growing the cells in the undifferentiated state                is to keep them from differentiating.  So when we remove them from                the undifferentiated culture conditions, these cells want to differentiate,                and we have molecular markers to prove that they are differentiated.                              We also have cytotoxic technology capable of detecting one out                of ten million cells that are undifferentiated should we need to                apply that later on in scale-up.                 So which cells are in animal models?  Well, first the hematopoietic                cells are in Canada, and we've demonstrated now engraftment                of these human embryonic stem cell derived hematopoietic cells in                the appropriate nude mouse model, which repopulates the animal's                peripheral blood.  That has important implications not only for                an alternative source of cells for bone marrow transplantation,                but for the second question regarding immune rejection.                 We've made dopaminergic cells which are engrafting robustly                in animal models of Parkinson's disease.  This is a huge tissue                engineering challenge where these cells must penetrate to the cortex                of the animal to completely correct the Parkinsonian defect.                 We have not yet demonstrated significant behavioral improvement                in the animals.  We are still working on that, but the cells engraft                robustly and, again, without tumors.                 The cell type that is most advanced is the oligodendrocyte, and                there will be a very exciting manuscript later this year from our                collaborator at UC-Irvine, Hans Keirsted, in which we have transplanted                the human oligodendrocytes into a model of spinal cord injury and                not only show statistically significant functional improvement of                the animal, but we have shown at the histologic level that the animal                cells are remyelinated by the cells that we have injected.                 Lastly, we are now in animal studies in three different labs with                cardiomyocytes injected into animal models of heart failure and                myocardial infarction.  Again, no tumors; again, the cells engraft,                and we have histologic evidence that these cells begin now to communicate                 with the animal cell  in situ  in the heart.                 So the work is early.  There is much more to do, but we are quite                pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and would                predict that the oligodendrocyte will be the first cell to enter                the clinical environment, and that an IND, if all goes well, could                be submitted in late '04 or early '05, which is quite a                bit ahead of most people's expectations.                 At this point our second cell type into the clinic would probably                be cardiomyocytes, based on the data set we have today.                 As part of that first question, you asked about obstacles.  There                are clearly many, many technical and scale-up obstacles that we                yet have to traverse, but those we think are fungible.  Our major                problem is funding.  We have done two reductions in force in the                company since a year ago.  We are one third of our former size.                              The political uncertainty of this field not only turns off investors,                but also turns off the other source of funding for biotech, which                are pharmaceutical partners, who at this point in time are completely                uninterested in this field.                 Turning to the issue of immune rejection, first, there are a number                of very exciting, new immunosuppressive drugs in clinical development.                 So I think the field of immune suppression through pharmacology                 will dramatically advance, and we hope to take advantage of that.                              Secondly, it's now known that pure effector cell transplants,                in other words, not organs that are contaminated by the donor's                immune system, are much less immunogenic in animal models and in                a few cases in human than is an entire organ transplant, again,                auguring well for the size of the problem of immune tolerance.                 Thirdly, there is some very exciting work that we are doing not                yet published, so I can only hint at it, that establishes the human                embryonic stem cell as being unusually unique in its immunologic                properties.  It has inherited some of the immunosuppressive properties                that are existent in the blastocyst.                 Why is it that the mothers never immunologically reject what is                an allograft, the blastocyst?  Well, there are specific reasons                for that, and those reasons are, in fact, inherent in the undifferentiated                embryonic stem cell.                 But in terms of our strategy, notwithstanding the prior points                of how to control immune rejection, we have one that makes a lot                of sense, and that is hematopoietic chimerism.  We know from the                bone marrow transplantation work that if a patient who gets a bone                marrow donation from me will be completely tolerant to receiving                a kidney allograft or a heart allograft from me.  The prior bone                marrow transplant has tolerized the patient to the antigens in my                tissues.                 We also know now from work done at Stanford that patients who                are status post whole organ transplant patients can be completely                weaned off of immunosuppressive drugs by giving them a mini bone                marrow transplant taken from a donor with the same tissue type as                the prior kidney donor.                 This is the strategy we plan to use out of the box in our clinical                program, having now established that we can derive hematopoietic                progenitors from one of the lines.   A dose of those cells should                tolerize the patient to any effector cell transplanted into that                individual derived from the same stem cell line.  So that is my                answer to Question  2.                 Lastly, you asked me to address issues of policy that affect our                ability to develop the programs.  Certainly the fact that this is                primarily an industrial paradigm helps with regard to FDA.  I've                worked with Kathryn Zoon and Phil Noguchi since the mid-'80s                in my prior company in cell therapies.  Many of the points to consider                that are now published came from our mutual collaboration in the                early work in the '80s and '90s in cell transplantation.                              The pathway to regulatory testing and commercialization with this                technology is clear.  There are some idiosyncracies, it is true,                but we understand the pathway, and we have thus far been very pleased                with our early interactions with the agency.                 The NIH has a different issue:  to recognize the primary role                in this field that has been played by industry.  That is not their                fault.  They were prohibited by law from funding this arena.  That                is how we got into it.  That is how we got ahead of everyone.                 But that has some special implications.  For us, as I manage Geron,                we have two platforms:  the stem cells that we're talking about                today and a cancer program based on telomerase.  And the management                and depth of technology in both of those platforms is hugely different                with, I think, important consequences both for patients and for                policy makers.                 On the cancer side, we have sent the telomerase gene to hundreds                of laboratories all around the world.  We have many, many collaborators.                 Many people have worked independently of us on telomerase.  So as                we move into the clinic with our anti-cancer platform, our scientific                understanding of how to use telomerase as a vaccine, how to develop                drugs that inhibit telomerase, how to use the promoter of telomerase                to drive oncolytic viruses is very, very deep.                 That reduces risks to patients and increases the likelihood that                our first entré into the clinics will be successful, as we                are, in fact, seeing with our telomerase vaccine program in the                clinic at Duke.                 That is to be contrasted with our program in embryonic stem cells,                where we have a small number of collaborators, the bulk of which                are frankly either in California funded by us and the State of California,                or in other countries, the U.K. and in Canada.                 So there's no question that when we think we are ready to                move into the clinic expeditiously and cautiously, having checked                all of the appropriate boxes the FDA wants us to check, we will                still be skating on relative thin ice in terms of the science behind                the product that we are testing in people.                 So the narrower science base in embryonic stem cell research increases                risk of technical failure and exposes patients to greater risk from                the experiment.                 The second point under policy I would make sort of illustrates                a problem that's about to happen.  We've heard a lot about                the issue of are the old existing lines okay.  What about new lines?                 Will they be different?  Will they be better?                 Well, the existing lines, as you've heard today, can be used                in human clinical trials, but they will not last forever, we don't                think.  There's no reason to assume that.  And these current                lines, all of them, were derived on mouse embryonic layers and,                as such, are appropriately classified as xenogeneic transplants                with increased risk to patients and a much increased burden on the                sponsor to follow these patients for life after they receive these                cells.  That's appropriate.                 So the FDA is urging us appropriately to derive new lines that                not only have not seen mouse feeders, but whose entire pedigree                is from reagents that are qualified for human use and that the entire                process of derivation be under GMP, good manufacturing practices.                              We will be successful in doing this.  We will generate such a                line very quickly, very soon, and then the implication of the current                policy, however, is that arguably this would be the best line to                use and to qualify and to share, but because it was derived after                2001 in August, the NIH will be prohibited from studying it.                 And what are the implications for when we take that cell line                into the clinic?  Will we be unable to share that cell line either                from a funding or a technology perspective with the NIH?                 So those are my brief comments on the three questions.  We are                unquestionably the leader in the field because of circumstances                that enabled us the freedom to operate, and in some ways, particularly                with regard to FDA and scale-up and GMP, that's good for the                field.                 But in terms of getting this technology embedded rapidly in the                most sophisticated biomedical community in the world, we are amiss.                              Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 I think we should hear from all four people together and then                have questions.                 Dr. Palmer, please.                  DR. PALMER:   Thank you, Chairman Kass, members of the Council.                              I'm here on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and I                was asked by the foundation and by the Council to give a little                bit of an overview of the foundation's efforts in targeting                Parkinson's disease.  So I'll talk to you a little bit about                Parkinson's disease, or PD, and then also the role of stem cells                in our portfolio; finally, a little bit about what we've learned                in three years of trying to use stem cells in this very targeted                application.                 The foundation is relatively new.  As you know, it started in                late winter of 2000.  The goal of the foundation is to match funding                to scientists who are pursuing every avenue of research to find                a cure for Parkinson's disease.                 Our secondary goal and my primary goal as an advisory board member                is to make sure that this funding reaches the investigator with                speed, and one of the things that we've found that has really                speeded the research is to short circuit some of the delay in an                investigator coming up with a good idea and then getting the funding                to that research.                 So we're targeting Parkinson's disease, and our efforts                in stem cells are quite narrow compared to many of the applications                that you'll hear today.  But Parkinson's disease is the                accelerated loss of a dopamine neuron in the adult brain.  These                neurons control movement, and the loss of the neuron does not allow                the brain to initiate movement.                 So one of the strategies, of course, is to replace those neurons                with a stem cell derived dopamine neuron population.  This is part                of our research effort.                 The other part, and in fact, a larger part, is to understand the                disease itself and then prevent or augment the remaining system,                prevent degeneration.                 So the brain doesn't replace these neurons, and the stem cell                biology really comes into play when you've got a patient who's                missing a substantial portion and is now dysfunctional in terms                of their ability to move.                 It's a slow disease.  It progresses over years, often decades.                 There's a declining quality of life, and the disease is lethal.                 It affects more than a million people in the U.S. alone, and there's                no cure.                 In the context of PD, stem cell technology has promised two significant                advances that are not available in any other context or form.  A                single culture can create enough dopamine neurons to cure the entire                population of PD patients if we can get the technology to work.                              This may not necessarily be true in practice, and we heard one                reason why this might not be true, if there are limits to the ability                to expand the culture.  But a second reason and perhaps one that's                not very well explored by the Council is the ability to use ES cell                lines as a tool for research and particularly as a way of making                authentic human dopamine neuron for drug screening or high throughput                assays of some sort or another.                 Now, this is a very important point I'll come back to later.                              I'd like to go over the portfolio of the Fox Foundation and                just give you a picture of the research that's being funded                in PD by a private sponsor of research.  To date the foundation                has funded 28 million in Parkinson's related research overall.                 This is since our inception in late 2000.                 Twenty percent of that fund has gone to stem cell research of                one sort or another, and it's a carefully chosen array of stem                cell strategies in mouse, non-human primate, and human embryonic                stem cell systems.                 At the time the grants were funded, so beginning in 2000, very                few investigators had either the ability or access to human lines,                and by default rather than by design, at this point except for one                study, all of the studies that we fund use approved lines.                 Now, this will change in the near future, and we anticipate in                the next rounds that we may see a significant increase in the request                for funding on non-approved lines.  And in part, we feel this is                driven by the FDA and the requirement for lack of adventitious agents                and just the ease at getting a cell line product through the approval                process if it has been isolated without the use of the animal cell                lines or animal products that were not characterized.                 So we have seen in the past several years a significant increase                in requests for stem cell funding in the review of our funding portfolio                and our upcoming funding efforts so that we're attracting new                scientists, people who have not really used stem cell technology                in their research into the area of Parkinson's disease.                 So as a tool, it's an attractive tool for a scientist who                knows Parkinson's as a model, but now wants to expand their                repertoire to use a tool that seems to have much higher promise                than the current strategies they're using.  So we're seeing                an increase in new researchers in the field.                  In our annual fast track funding, this is an independent, investigator-initiated                pilot study where investigators send in unsolicited proposals.                 In 2001, we had roughly 200 applications in Parkinson's in general.                 Ten of these were stem cell applications.  The total request at                that point was just a little over a million dollars.                 In 2002, we had a similar number of total applications, and our                requests went up.  We had 12 requests.  Two and a half million dollars                would have funded all of those stem cell requests.                 And in our pending round in 2003, we have over 200 total applications                that we're anticipating, and more than 20 of these are stem                cell related.  And over time, we're seeing a significant increase                in both the application of stem cells to cell replacement in Parkinson's,                but more interestingly, a recognition of their utility as an  in                vitro  source of authentic human neurons, where people can study                drug effects or the genetics of Parkinson's disease itself.                 And these are studies that are not necessarily targeted at replacement,                but more at understanding the disease and then coming up with a                non-stem cell basis for treatment.                 So the foundation's experience has given us some insights                into what a moratorium would mean in terms of research on stem cells                and also what the current policy on federal funding is.  We have                a diverse portfolio.  We have studies on embryonic stem cells as                well as fetal stem cells and adult stem cells.  Many of these projects                were funded early in our round because the advisory board felt that                stem cell strategies had very high merit, and one of our first efforts                was in creating cell lines that could be used for transplantation.                              So we have now and unusual point of view where we can actually                compare the preliminary results from a variety of efforts.  After                two years of focused research, we can see that if this was a foot                race and we were comparing adult stem cells to fetal stem cells,                there's no competition.  There really is no race involved at                all.                 We have data generated from our funded research that shows that                the adult tissues are not presently a robust source of cells, particularly                when it comes to creating dopamine neurons in our focused effort                to treat Parkinson's disease.                 Optimists would say that there's still potential, and there                is still potential in leveraging the adult stem cell to our goals                as a Parkinson's research foundation.                 But to contrast the progress made in the same time frame with                embryonic stem cells, it's a fragile hope at best to say that                in the immediate future the adult cells hold the promise that we                had hoped two or three years ago that we would see in the research.                              So it is now clearly demonstrated  in vitro , and when we                started this was still an unknown, but now quite well established                in several of our funded laboratories that the human embryonic stem                cells can make authentic dopamine neurons.  What's left now                is the practical application of making this work in a transplant,                and these are ongoing studies.                 So I mentioned a moment ago the proliferative potential provides                a means to treat many individuals from a single isolate.  Unfortunately                our research experience is now encompassing a number of cell transplant                strategies.  The farthest along of these is fetal tissue transplantation                where you harvest from the fetal tissue an authentic dopamine neuron                and transplant that into a Parkinson's patient.                 One of the key observations now that we have had blinded clinical                trials tell us that there may be additional problems that were unforeseen,                a key point is the presence of a fairly robust immune response in                many of these patients, and this is something that cannot really                be ignored.                 I have to take my hat off right now and put on my own personal                hat so that I'm no longer a foundation representative here.                 I work in adult stem cell biology, and it's my hope that we                can make endogenous neural progenitors do the job of an embryonic                stem cell, but in studying the behavior of newborn neurons from                endogenous precursors, we have just run into a very serious impediment                that involves the immune system.                 The immune system, if activated in the context of a developing                neuron, essentially shuts off this early progenitor's ability                to make a functioning neuron, and if we're looking at cell transplantation                as a way to cure Parkinson's disease and the cell transplants                are not well matched to the host or if there isn't a strategy                for making the host tolerant, then having just a few lines is going                to be a very serious impediment to applying the existing lines to                clinical research.                 So getting back to the foundation portfolio, there is another                benefit to looking at additional lines of ES cells.  Putting cell                replacement aside and now looking at the technology that stem cells                in the culture dish provides, there's a body of research that                has been going on for nearly 20 years or more, and that's the                technology of transgenic animals and, more recently, the use of                embryonic stem cells in creating mice that carry very discrete genetic                mutations.                 Now, one of the strategies that we as a foundation trying to cure                Parkinson's disease contemplate is the value of having embryonic                stem cells that actually carry the genetic profile of a Parkinson's                patient, and although we're not talking today necessarily about                nuclear transfer technologies, this clearly pops into mind as a                strategy for making an  in vitro  authentic dopamine neuron                population that is identical to a class of patients that are presenting                a certain disease phenotype.                 So the disease is diverse.  It presents early and progresses rapidly                or it can present very late in life when a tottering gait is really                 commonplace in that age bracket and, therefore, it's not as                big of an effect.                 But this variability is really as variable as human life itself,                and so having 11 or 12 lines from normal individuals does not allow                us to access to that technology, and the creation of drugs that                would more readily target a type of dopamine neuron depletion or                a disease context.                 So the targeted manipulation of genes in an embryonic stem cell                is another aspect of this that is now just entering science, and                the ability to introduce genes into human ES cells or to target                mutations to an individual cell population obviously gives you a                potential way around this, but this is a technology that's novel.                              Nuclear transfer technology would circumvent that.  It gives us                the baseline from which to understand how to create ES cells through                a non-embryonic process, but there has to be a way to get from Point                A to Point B, and this is where the additional lines and the exploration                of new technologies comes into play.                 I'd like to finalize or just summarize here with an overview                of current research concerns.  In the near term, human ES cells                are already undergoing efficacy trials in preclinical models.  So                human ES cells, as we heard earlier, are in animals, and there's                great hope that we'll see that they're at least as effective,                if not more so, if the immune complications can be overcome than                the fetal tissue transplants that are so commonplace now.                 To move forward with these lines, there are several limitations                with current policy that seem to inhibit our progress as a foundation                that's trying to promote cure or intervention in stem cells.                 The first is what I've targeted mostly in my presentation, and                that's the heterogeneity of these current cell lines and limited                numbers.                 So if you start with a few lines and the cell lines are heterogeneous,                some will make, in our experience, a lot of dopamine neurons, and                others really seem to be impeded in their ability to respond to                the same cues provided in the same dish.                 So in this preliminary data that we see presented in summarizing                our funded work, we're observing that one line will work beautifully                well in a paradigm.  Another line is basically eliminated from the                study because it has an inability to make enough dopamine neurons                to be useful.                 So heterogeneity in the performance of an individual line may                limit what can be done with the existing lines, and of course, the                absence of genetic diversity within the existing lines, the absence                of a representation of disease genotype is limiting in what can                be done at the research bench in understanding the disease process,                and of course, heterogeneity in HLA matching may be a very serious                concern, and it will require additional complexity and treatment                if we don't have a matched donor and host or fairly stringent                strategies for tolerizing the host to the incoming cells.                 Finally, I think there is this question that's been touched                upon quite broadly today, and that's the presence of adventitious                agents in the existing lines and whether or not the foundation's                research can transition quickly to clinic really depends on how                well an existing line can meet FDA requirements.                 And I've heard that this is possible, but it also places an                extreme burden of follow-up on a funded project that makes it difficult                for a private foundation to fund.                 So in the absence of federal funding, is private support really                up to the task?  And I think really to summarize this, the private                foundation's focus is to pilot research, to find very good strategies                or promising strategies, and that's where our funding really                runs out.  The NIH has typically stepped in at that point, after                the pilot study stage, and proceeded with the larger experiments,                the validation, the expansion.                 If the foundation funds unapproved lines, that has nowhere to                go at this point.  So there is a serious concern that though we                may be able to use private funding to our benefit, that there will                be a stall or serious delay in getting this to clinic.                 So these burdens loom particularly large to us as a foundation                as the Baby Boomers age, and the number of Parkinson's patients                increases.  The social and economic costs go well beyond just the                Parkinson's community, and I think the economic costs in terms                of the cost of clinical care is just one part of it.  The economic                cost in delayed development of drugs because we cannot use in the                public sector privately funded ES lines for drug screening or nuclear                transfer lines for screening, lines that carry a disease phenotype.                              I think this is an economic burden that our society has to face                and one that should be very carefully weighed in the Council's                discussion.                 I think the foundation very much appreciates the ability and the                invitation here to give our experiences, and we understand that                you have a very difficult task ahead of you as counsel to the President,                and we thank you for this opportunity.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dr. Palmer.                 Mr. Pursley, please.                   MR. PURSLEY:   Yes.  Thank you.                 Thank you for having Osiris here.  We've been involved in                mesenchymal stem cell, adult stem cell research for about 11 years                now.  Our technology came out of Arnie Kaplan's lab and was                acquired from Case Western at that time, and we've been solely                focused in that area since on several applications.                 Our development strategy is very straightforward.  It's tissue                engraftment and regeneration without immune suppression.                  Let me back up a moment, too, to set the record straight.  In                some of the earlier media documents, it has me as a Ph.D.  I'm                not a scientist or a physician.  I'm a businessman, and if my                technical explanations aren't satisfactory, most of what I'm                going to report on is published or we believe will be published                in acceptable peer review journals, and in fact, correct me if I'm                wrong.  This panel should have been provided privately an embargoed                manuscript that will be submitted.                 Okay.  Our technology is the universal application, and I'll                explain that term in a moment, of adult MSCs, or mesenchymal stem                cells, with no  in vitro  manipulation.  In other words, if                you will, these very smart cells do what they do  in vivo .                 We simply put them in there and let them go, so to speak.  And I'll                define that in some of our programs.                 What I mean by universal application, we started out as an autologous                cell company and later found out that we can provide from any donor,                unrelated, HLA unmatched, any donor these cells to any recipient                without immune rejection.                 And in fact, what you'll see in our first program, we found                them to be immune selective, T cell-suppressive in some instances.                 So we are now working on what would be literally an off-the-shelf                product for whatever the indication may be.                 The process we use under anappropriate IRB protocol, again, we                take an unrelated, unmatched, volunteer adult donor.  We take a                bone marrow aspirate, a whole marrow aspirate from the iliac crest,                bring that back to our manufacturing, and then we will culture and                expand that currently to about 1,000 doses from one donor.                 We are going through an expansion now that's not a change                in process.  It's an expansion of process.  We will ultimately                get that to about 10,000 doses per single donor.                 A very nice advantage of this is that we don't have to expand                cells indefinitely.  We can go back to new donors.  Currently one                donor can provide bone marrow six times in their lifetime.  These                are usually younger people because the younger you are, the more                MSCs you have.                 We will then cryopreserve the finished product in liquid nitrogen,                and at that point it is ready to go to clinic for use.  We also                now have done stability and potency testing to have that stored                at a lesser temperature over X period of time in certain containers                so that it's easier for the hospitals to use.                 The safety of these cells in the universal application has been                proven now.  Allogenic MSCs have been given to 56 human beings.                 Thousands of various animals models have been used, rats, mice,                goats, dogs, pigs, and baboons.                 This has been done in conjunction with the NIH, Hopkins, Cedar-Sinai,                Texas Heart, et cetera.  And at this point, over several years now,                there has been no possibly or probably related serious adverse events                associated with MSCs.  This includes no infusion or direct administrative                toxicity.  There's no ectopic tissue formation.  In other words,                they aren't differentiating in cartilage  in the heart, on the                knee, et cetera, and there is no tumor formation at this time.                 And, in fact, we have two lead programs in Phase 2, which by definition                from the agency standards, the FDA, means we have met their safety                standards for biologic in order to move into Phase 2.  So we are                very happy to report we see and now the agency sees these cells                as safe, allowing us to move into Phase 2.                 Now, the precise mechanism of action regarding this universal                application is not known.  All we do know is apparently there are                certain cell surface characteristics of the MSC that do not elicit                an immune response, and in fact, as I said, as you'll see in                our first indication, are actually immune suppressive.                 As far as how close are we to developing therapies, our first                two programs are in Phase 2.  The first is peripheral blood stem                cell transplant support for patients with hematologic malignancies,                and again, forgive me if you're very familiar with this pathology,                but basically if you have a leukemia, a myeloma, a lymphoma, et                cetera, a blood cancer, you receive total body irradiation and/or                chemotherapy, with the goal of obliterating the bone marrow because                that's the source of the cancered blood.                 These patients then need to receive a transplant.  They receive                a peripheral blood transplant of hematopoietic stem cells so they                can produce enough platelets to clot and white cells to fight infection                and red blood cells for volume, and gain a natural state of hematopoiesis.                              And those cells usually come from a sibling or a parent.  The                problem is for these patients who have no choice but to go through                this, ten percent and up to 20 percent can actually die from this                procedure, with the vast majority of graft versus host disease,                and that means the hematopoietic stem cells are rejecting the recipient.                              And so what we did in a Phase 1, in a multi-center Phase 1, is                provide MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells approximately four hours prior                to the transplantation with, first of all, in a Phase 1, the primary                goal for a biologic is always safety, and you look for secondary                efficacy trends, which are great if you reach them, and we did in                a very big way.                 What we did is reduce significantly graft versus host disease.                 So we believe there was a T cell suppressive effect in working with                the patient or with the hematopoietic stem cells not to reject the                patient, if you will.                 Now, the reason we say selective T cells suppressive, these Phase                1 patients are now out three years.  They have also had a significant                reduction in return of the cancer, which means we did not suppress                the T cells fighting GVL, graft versus leukemia.                 This was a very big concern.  If these are immune suppressive,                are we going to hurt the patient's own ability to fight the                cancer coming back?  And what we've seen at three years out                is this is not only not the case.  They have a less incidence of                return of the cancer.                 So with those data we are in Phase 2. This is an IV preparation.                 The status is we should have Phase 2 data reportable in time Q3                of '04.                 If that goes well, we will go into a Phase 3, and this should                be available to the hematologic malignancy population if things                go as planned, and Murphy has a way of raising his head in this                business and always will, but even with some of those considerations,                we would hope to be commercially available to humans by 2007 with                this.                 Just after that program, a very similar situation but a different                mechanism of action, which is the amazing thing about these cells.                 That was a T cell suppression effect to reduced GVHD.  In a similar                sense there are infants to adolescents primarily who don't have                matched donors who will receive cord blood transplants, and their                problem is not GVHD because there are so few hematopoietic stem                cells in the  cord blood transplants.  Their problem is establishing                a natural hematopoiesis.                 So some of these kids will lay in the hospital an average of about                90 days.  It's fairly replete in the literature, and they aren't                released from the hospital until they produce enough platelets to                get out, and so they can sit for 90 days in a subacute state with                bleeds and infections, et cetera.                 This is a tiny population.  It's an orphan indication, but                there's nothing that can be done for these, and in  a Phase                1 study with an admittedly retrospective comparison to that database.                 All of these kids are in a single database in the U.S.                 Our primary goal was to decrease the time to platelet engraftment,                to get these kids out of the hospital and establish a natural hematopoiesis,                and the kids that received MSCs got out in an average of about 38                days compared to retrospective control, historical control of 90.                              And so that program is in Phase 2, and we hope it would be available                also to humans in the '07 time frame.                 The very large and much more talked about program, our cardiac                program for acute MI, will be in humans this December in conjunction                with Boston Scientific.  Most of this preclinical work was done                in swine models at Cedar-Sinai and Hopkins, and the primary goal                here is for these cells to reshape the baseline morphology, the                heart, and regain the baseline function of the heart pre-MI.                 It is fantastic preclinical data, and I say that with humility                after looking at preclinical data for 24 years in this business.                 After you see so many pig hearts grow back and get back to normal                function, you start to believe it.                 And the IND has been filed, and the FDA will allow us to go into                clinic at the NIH and Duke this December.                 The idea here, too, in this indication, something we just found                out in '99 in rats, this will be an IV administration.  It is                not a direct injection or catheter application to the heart.  Apparently                these very smart cells — and I can call them that because I'm                not a scientist — find their way to an inflammatory site.                  And an acute MI is a very strong inflammatory event, and an inflammatory                cascade that probably lasts in a strong manner for seven or eight                days.  And basically these are given IV.  They swim to the heart.                 They regenerate the infarcted area of the heart, which the heart                doesn't then respond with a compensatory thickening like normal,                and that happens in about four to six weeks, and in about six months                the heart gets very close back to pre-MI function.                 And if that gets in the clinic in December as planned, and it                should, these are going to be much larger trials because of acute                MI.  We would like to think that this product could be available                to the public commercially in 2009 or 2010.                 The next product which we have an IND filed for and will be in                humans before the end of '04 is meniscal repair in the knee.                 This is the most common knee injury at least in this country.  There's                about 850,000 meniscal tears, from the Weekend Warriors.  This will                be a high regulatory bar.  It should be.  These are healthy young                people normally, and so the safety is going to be critical.                 Preclinical work has been done in 72 goats, and basically what                we do is do a partial to full meniscectomy as is done with the patients.                 There's nothing you can do for this today but take out part                or all of the meniscectomy to ease the pain.  After whole or partial                meniscectomy, it is replete in the literature that one goes on to                develop osteoarthritis.                And what we do is give about 150 million cells directly into the                knee, and it grows back the meniscus in about six weeks time, and                hopefully then it will obviate any progression to osteoarthritis,                and we hope to be in the clinic with that as well in, again, '04                and, again, should be commercially available to humans in a similar                time as the acute MI product in '09 or '10.                 The last advanced program, also in concert with Boston Scientific,                is maybe the largest unmet definitive therapy  in terms of societal                cost, and that's congestive heart failure or, maybe more appropriately,                chronic ischemia leading to congestive heart failure.  At Texas                Heart, in the canine model, we put an amaroid occluder in place                in these dogs to mimic chronic ischemia.  Basically you do that                for about 30 days until you create an ischemic model.                 About 30 days later you give the MSCs.  The ejection fraction                in the amaroid occluded non-treated dogs, once it drops below 17                percent, they die.  The ejection fraction in the treated dogs with                the occluded, LAD still in place, the occlusion remaining in place,                goes back to normal function in about six months.                 So basically we've restored the heart morphology and the baseline                heart function pre-ischemic model with the amaroid occluder in place,                and there is possibly some form of angiogenesis going on here.                 So those are the advanced programs, and in all of these programs                and all of the animal models to this date, there have been no serious                adverse events associated with MSCs, again, neither infusional toxicity,                ectopic foci, or tumor formation.                 Finally, we have many, many orthopedic models in a preclinical                area where we will or will not use a scaffolding or a matrix for                these cells in some of those applications.                 And finally, we are involved in grants from DARPA and NIST looking                at wound healing and CNS repair, respectively.                 As far as what obstacles stand in the way, the usual.  One is                enough money, especially in today's very tight private equity                market, and it's probably going to stay that way until the IPO                lid comes off.                 Cell biology talent.  We will be forever understanding what goes                on with these, which leads to another point I'll get to in a                moment.                 And then one, to put into an equal bag where we can all take an                equal share of guilt, and that's politics, corporate greed,                and academic ego, which is a bane always in the development of any                of these, and I don't say this lightly.  Again, as a personal                comment after being involved in this 24 years and being fortunate                enough to be at Genentech when they grew up and then at Genzyme                when they grew up and at TKT with maybe the most elegant protein                technology I've ever seen.  Have never seen anything like this.                              The hardest thing about managing this company is keeping it focused.                 There is no application that can't be brought up that we can                deny the possibility of the use of these cells or cells like this.                               Bill Krivits up at Minnesota has given these to kids with lysosomal                storage diseases and they are not transduced.  They just start secreting                the enzyme they're missing.                 The immune modulation possibility now that we found out almost                serendipitously with our first program, that's a whole new area                of arthritis, et cetera.  It literally is limited by our imagination,                and it's bigger than any of those entities I mentioned by far.                 It is the closest thing — and I'm sorry for the drama — of a                human health care miracle that I've seen in a quarter century.                              And I just hope somehow those entities can synergize to bring                this as quickly as possible and as safely as possible to the millions                and millions of people.                 As far as approaches to overcome immune reaction, we don't                have any.  We have found that there is no immune reaction against                these cells, and not only that.  We have found them to be immune                suppressive selectively in appropriate situations.                 As far as the federal policy impact, depending on what your patent                portfolio is, that drives your answer on this.  Right now we think                from the Patent Office's perspective it's a very good thing.                 We have had senior scientists that have stuck with this from the                beginning because they believe with this their inventions have been                protected, and it is allowed to go on in a protected manner to develop                those.                 As far as the NIH, again, anything that can be done by that institution                to further synergize itself with commercial endeavors without feeling                it is bastardizing its academic purity, and exactly what that means                and how that is getting done we don't have an answer, and I                don't know who does, but it certainly could help all efforts.                              And the FDA, first of all, I want to say, again, in a long experience                over several technologies, they have been a very good partner with                us in this, and we appreciate that.  We're a tiny company.                 We need a lot of guidance, and it hasn't been an adversarial                situation.   It has been a partnership situation, and anything to                continue to increase that.                 We are in the good fortune of being by far the most advanced company                in the world in adult stem cell research, and so it has got to be                in partnership with the FDA that we understand how these are to                be regulated because I think that will set the bar for how it is                done from this point on.                 I think one of the things that will be looked at, and we have                to understand where we draw the line to accept, is especially in                the technology where everything is happening  in vivo , basically                from a cell that's the same  ex vivo .  Without all of                the black box answers for mechanism of action, why, how, where,                how long known is how that will be weighed against the actual clinical                outcomes of safety and efficacy and how that regulatory guide pole                is looked at is critical.                 Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Dr. Goldstein, please.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   Chairman Kass and members of the President's                Council on Bioethics, thank you very much for inviting me to testify                today.                 I'm the Chief Scientific Officer for the Juvenile Diabetes                Research Foundation.                 JDRF was founded in 1970 by parents of children with juvenile                diabetes to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through                the support of research, and this year we expect to fund approximately                $90 million worth of research.                 Since its inception JDRF has funded diabetes research all over                the world, and it turns out it's the world's leading nonprofit,                non-governmental funder of diabetes research.                 At your July 25th meeting, you heard from Charles Queenan, a JDRF                volunteer, who spoke about the advances in islet cell transplantation                that are showing dramatic results in people with Type I diabetes.                 I'd like to briefly summarize.                 As of April 2003, more than 250 patients worldwide had received                islets infusions using the so-called Edmondton protocol.  About                half of these patients received islets alone.  The other half received                islets in conjunction with or after a kidney transplant.                 Most patients have enjoyed insulin independence, reduced hypoglycemic                episodes, and improved quality of life.                 Despite this success, there are too few insulin producing cells                available from organ donors that at its max could help perhaps five,                six, 700 people a year.  JDRF, therefore, believes that embryonic                stem cell research could lead to the discovery of new ways to develop                additional and unlimited supplies of insulin producing beta cells                with the hope that everyone with the disease can be treated and                cured.                 With this background, I want to cover some of the activities that                JDRF is engaged in over the past several years in the United States                and abroad to help advance the embryonic stem cell research agenda.                              In the spring of 2000, we announced our intention to support embryonic                stem cell research.  We began to build a research portfolio that                promoted human and animal stem cell research.                 To insure the ethical conduct of this research we formed a stem                cell oversight committee consisting of leading researchers, policy                makers, ethicists, and lay volunteers who were charged with providing                a second level of review in addition to the usual scientific peer                review for all human stem cell research applications that we received                and considered.                 We recognize that stem cell research may require innovative and                novel public/private partnerships, and we included in our request                or solicitation the notation that we would support the derivation                of human embryonic stem cell lines.                 The scientific principles that form the basis for stem cell research                funding program is as follows.  We recognize the need to support                research using human stem cells from all sources and that  very                basic research is the necessary precursor for the development of                cell based therapies; that adult stem cell research is a complementary                approach.  We have long supported efforts in both adult stem cell                research, as well as more recently human embryonic stem cell research.                              JDRF believes in providing a collaborative environment that will                encourage or maximize the opportunity and promise of this research,                and we work to insure easy and public dissemination  of embryonic                stem cell lines without major restrictions as to the usage, and                we're committed to sharing information and data as they become                available.                 We also participate in forums for public dialogue and dissemination                information.                 JDRF embryonic stem cell research activities today include everything                that I mentioned, cells from all sources.  This year we have applied                approximately $6 million in support of stem cell research with out-year                commitments of about $16 million over the next four years.  Of the                $6 million this year, about three million is for research to direct                the differentiation into glucose-responsive, insulin- producing                cells using human embryonic stem cells as starting material.  About                two million is for research using human stem cells from other sources,                and one million for animal work.                 About one third of JDRF's funding for human embryonic stem                cell research supports work done in the United States.  The rest                supports research outside the United States where in many cases                investigators work in more favorable environments, often with special                government programs that provide extra resources for human embryonic                stem cell research efforts, for example, Sweden, the United Kingdom,                Australia, and Singapore.                 We initially received very few applications from U.S. based investigators,                perhaps related to concerns over policies and restrictions.  We                have received consistent feedback from U.S. investigators that they                are wary of entering this field even with private funding due to                the limitations imposed by the federal policy.                 They, in addition, mentioned a limited number of federally approved                lines, the lack of genetic diversity among the lines, insufficient                characterization, variability in the developmental capacities of                the lines, difficulties in distribution, as well as the ubiquitous                presence of the mass feeder layers which we've been discussing                which make the development of clinically useful cell therapies not                impossible, but more difficult as has been mentioned.                 These barriers we feel need to be removed to increase the value                of using the approved stem cell lines for research and then for                the development of therapies.  We acknowledge and recognize the                efforts of the NIH, particularly the NIH stem cell task force, and                we are working closely with NIH on this.                 But I think that it's our international partnerships that                are pertinent to the conversation this afternoon.                 JDRF's international efforts have continued and been expanded                in the area of stem cell research both through independent funding                of investigators, as well as through partnerships directly with                other governments.  We have established a series of co-funding partnerships                with government research agencies in the United Kingdom, Sweden,                Canada, Australia, France and Singapore, and we have ongoing discussions                with others.                 In some of these partnerships, local foundations within those                countries also provide support.                 In addition, in many of those countries, we have provided funding                for very basic embryonic stem cell research that was not necessarily                connected to diabetes in any particular way since the research was                at the earliest stage.                 Because of our extensive international work and leadership, JDRF                was invited in January 2003 to be a founding member of the International                Stem Cell Forum established by the Medical Research Council of the                United Kingdom under the leadership of Professor Sir George Radda.                              This group currently includes representatives from government                agencies in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Finland, France,                Germany, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the Netherlands,                as well as the NIH.                 The objectives of the forum are to encourage collaborative research                across nations, boundaries, and disciplines; to encourage sharing                of resources and data; to fully capitalize on the existing available                human stem cell lines; to identify key research gaps and address                these by capitalizing on national strength; and to identify funding                schemes that actually facilitate transnational collaborations.                 In specific terms, this group has agreed to develop a set of criteria                that could be adopted globally for optimizing the derivation characterization                and maintenance of human stem cell lines from all sources; identify                a small number of international laboratories that would commit to                using the agreed criteria to characterize existing human embryonic                stem cell lines; and to identify opportunities for sharing resources,                cell lines, data protocols, and guidance documents on an international                basis; to coordinate or make an attempt to coordinate national stem                cell banking activities.                 This group has already convened a working group to characterize                stem cell lines with a series of recommendations.                 The United Kingdom has one of the more progressive environments                for stem cell research as a consequence of the British government                providing strong political, regulatory, and funding support in this                area.  The recent establishment of the U.K. Stem Cell Bank is one                example.  This will provide access to existing and new quality controlled                adult, fetal, and embryonic stem cell lines.  It will have a good                manufacturing practice arm for research leading to clinical applications.                              Academic researchers and companies from the U.K. and elsewhere                will be eligible to deposit and to access lines according to a code                of practice developed by interested parties.                 This bank will serve as an outstanding example of how to foster                and enhance the research needed to develop therapies from stem cells                of all kinds.                 Other countries are working toward the development of similar                resources, and it is envisioned that the International Stem Cell                Forum may serve to coordinate such activities in order to enhance                the exchange of information and to provide complementary efforts                in this burgeoning field of research.                 Examples of activities under consideration include the establishment                of a registry posted on an international Web site that would provide                appropriate scientific information about lines not listed in the                current NIH registry; characterization of non-NIH registry lines,                and comparison with NIH lines; in addition, joint training programs                to assist new investigators.                 Organizing and coordinating these international research activities                in order to better serve research efforts everywhere provides a                model that is highly likely to bring results to the clinic much                sooner.                 Well, this summarizes research activities to date.  I do not want                to provide the impression that these international activities, for                example, can replace the resources which the federal government                and United States could provide for this research.                 The limitations imposed by the current policy raise questions                and provoke uncertainties about the future  of human embryonic stem                cell research in the United States.  We think that one result is                fewer scientists working, fewer graduate students, postdocs, et                cetera, and universities who have less than an active willingness                to invest in facilities, a comment that was made earlier in the                afternoon.                 These resources could make a significant difference to research                progress in the development of insulin producing beta cells for                the cure of diabetes, and in this area, they need to establish and                nurture collaborations between the world's experts in beta cell                biology and the world's experts in stem cell biology so they                can collectively conduct the necessary research.  It remains a critical                event.                 Expanded federal embryonic stem cell policy would make an important                difference in helping promote this research.                 Much of the current knowledge of beta cell development comes from                studies using mass embryonic stem cells that is not always easily                translatable into human work.  Several protocols, however, have                been reported that direct mass embryonic stem cells to becoming                functioning islet cells.  Early studies in human embryonic stem                cells suggest that they could be coached, though at the moment inefficiently                to insulin secreting cells, and this work has gone a little more                slowly than we would like.                 We do continue to support research on the differentiation of adult                precursor cells into beta cells, but that's a severely limited                field in terms of how successful it has been.                 Progress to date does underscore the need for continued investment                in research in this area, including the creation of an environment                in the United States that encourages and supports scientific discovery.                              The potential for this research to have a positive impact on the                maybe 100 million Americans who suffer from a wide variety of diseases                and injuries who might benefit is just too great to be ignored.                              Thank you for your invitation, your time, and your consideration.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you, Dr. Goldstein.                 Thank all of your for your fine presentations.                  Let me just throw the floor open.  Let me, so that everybody knows                where we are, we started late.  We were originally scheduled to                go to 5:15.  Let's go to at least 5:25 and get people's                questions out so that we take advantage of our guests who traveled                so far to be with us.                 So, please, Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Several of you referred to the political                uncertainty of stem cell research in the United States, and in the                course of making these remarks, you listed many possibilities.                 I would like to know from you as briefly as possible what you think                is the chief political uncertainty.                 Is it money?  Is it stem cell lines?  Is it the number of researchers                or what?  What is the political uncertainty that you're concerned                about?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, the quick answer is all of the above                that you just mentioned.  If I were to prioritize them, it is the                pure political process of taking scientific inquiry out of the hands                and hearts of the scientists and into the halls of Congress.                 Can the environment worsen with a different administration or                with the same administration?  These are exactly the things that                our investors tell us that they are concerned about.                 But the fact that there is a very thin infrastructure to complement                what we are doing at Geron, what other folks that you've heard                are doing here makes the risk higher to achieve a commercialable                and safe and effective product.  They are intimately intertwined.                               PROF. WILSON:   That is true, but Congress has always, since                1938, placed under legislation by its action important therapeutic                regimes that might affect the safety or health of other people.                 Is this supposed to be exempt from that?                  DR. OKARMA:   I'd like to hear an example of that that                compares to the —                  PROF. WILSON:   Well, the FDA constantly regulates.                  DR. OKARMA:   That's not political; that's not congressional.                 This is different.                  PROF. WILSON:   Oh, there's a difference between the                FDA and Congress?  You'll have to explain that to me.                  DR. OKARMA:   I think there certainly is.                  PROF. WILSON:   Anyone else have a response?                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   The universities during the past two years-plus,                since the administration's policy, have had a variety of information                coming.  As Dr. Zerhouni told you, it has only been since his arrival                that the stem cell task force was created.  So some time was lost.                              The most simplest example that I can give you is the confusion                over the application of federal policy to indirect cost of university                researchers, and it has only been in the past four to six months                where people have accepted the notion that they can do federally                funded research next door to privately funded research without getting                in trouble.                 The clarification of that was painfully slow, and people just                didn't hop on the bandwagon immediately.                 The second part, I think, has to do with what investigators tell                us, is it takes me six to eight months to work through my research                office to get a material transfer agreement to get one cell line                at $5,000.  I'm hardly likely to be interested in studying two,                three, or more at that pace and would prefer some more economical                and more free distribution of more well characterized material.                              So that inherent slowness is not exactly a terrific ingredient                for promoting and expediting research in a new area.  It's one                reason why the international community, for example, has taken a                very strong position to complement the NIH activity and make materials,                information available on a more free exchange environment.                 And you know, it's in a time when budgets for funding research                worldwide seem to be down.  I would point out that the U.K., Japan                have put special extra money at this topic because they view it                as an opportunity.  That coincident with decreases in their regular                research budgets.                 So people see this as a major opportunity.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso.                   DR. FOSTER:   Jim, were you through?                  PROF. WILSON:   Yes.                   DR. FOSTER:   Dr. Okarma, I wanted to ask one question                that I wasn't sure about.  You emphasized the oligodendrocyte                as one of your chief cells that was moving on.  You said you were                working on this in spinal cord injury, but I presume this would                be some myelinating agent in something like MS or multiple sclerosis                or something as well.  I don't know that, but the question would                be if you put in a differentiated cell and let's say you have                a balance between, you know, some autoimmune disease that's                demyelinating and an oligodendrocyte that's myelinating, the                question I was going to ask is that apparently a lot of times there's                a block in the oligodendrocyte capacity to myelinate because there's                a block in the movement from the pre-oligodendrocyte to the oligodendrocyte                by, you know, a jagged notch interaction or something like that.                              So I guess the question I'm asking:  is this differentiated                cell going to be — we've talked about the problem of immune                rejection and things like that — but is there another problem in                certain diseases of differentiated cells that they might not work                because of the primary disease that's present?                  DR. OKARMA:   That's precisely correct, and we have                yet done no work on systemic autoimmune based demyelinating diseases,                although to your point, they could potentially be subject to — we                have only worked on oligodendrocyte precursors in acute spinal cord                injury.                   DR. FOSTER:   Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso Gomez-Lobo.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I don't know who this question                is going to go to.  Probably Dr. Okarma.                 I understand my charge here in this Council primarily as a duty                to worry about bioethics.  I mean this is a Council on Bioethics,                and that's the way I see my social role in this context.                 And one of the things that worries me is that in these presentations,                in these wonderful presentations you have made, I don't see                that dimension.  For instance, it's one thing for there to be                political problems and perhaps concentrated on Congress, but I think                that there's the larger context of the whole nation and there's                the larger context of our lives and of the respect we owe to each                other, et cetera.                 And then the question arises:   shouldn't we see a problem                in the fact that a blastocyst that we know could be implanted and                continue its journey towards being like one of us, if that's                destroyed to extract the embryonic stem cells, whether we should                not worry at all about that?  Is that a reason why some people may                have serious doubts not about the benefits, but about the means                to obtain these benefits?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, sir, I was specifically asked                not to address those concerns, but let me assure you that they are                very prominent in the culture of our company.  Approximately six                months after I arrived at Geron in December of '97, I formed                an ethics advisory board to discuss precisely those issues both                for my own uncertainties, to more vigorously and rigorously dissect                the issues as viewed by different Western religious traditions,                as well as secular perspectives, and to expose the workers in the                company to this body and have them ask their own questions of it,                which has helped us enormously and has informed us about the issues                of moral status and has comforted us in our position that this is                not an ends justifies the means argument, but that the special circumstances,                the scalability, the biological diversity, the normalness of the                cells that we're able to manufacture from a single stem cell                line made from a single embryo destined for destruction tilts the                moral seesaw in our direction.                 And we are intellectually and emotionally convinced of that point.                               DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   May I?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to respond?                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Fair enough.  Now, that's a                straightforward utilitarian argument, and someone may say that,                you know, even one adult could be sacrificed for many.  So there                are serious problems with that argument.                 Let me leave it at that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone else want to respond to the                question as put before I call on someone else?                 Dr. Goldstein.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   I would like to make a general comment                that we took the issue so seriously that we added an additional                layer of oversight, and the charge to the committee was to provide                and consider and revisit issues as they come up.                 We assumed this was going to be a dynamic field, and this committee                developed guidelines.  It watches over and it considers many aspects                that we don't consider with typical research grants, with typical                research grants that the IRB approves and you have all of the signatures                on.                 So I think it has been taken in extremely serious ways.  I don't                have a specific response about, yes, this is the correct or incorrect                or that kind of thing, but we made this effort because we saw this                as an issue, and we decided we needed a serious way to deal with                it.                 And this committee reports directly to our board.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet, Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I'd like further discussion in two areas,                and I suspect  that maybe it's both Dr. Okarma and Dr. Palmer                who might respond to this.                 First, I was surprised at your discussion of your funding problems                at Geron and the fact that you're only a third of the size of                a year ago because implicit in much of what has been written and                discussed earlier this morning, the assumption was that the federal                funding wasn't going to be important because private funding                was so robust and we could sit back and let the private sector take                care of it.                 And you've raised some question about that more rosy view.                              I have another question though about the role of nonapproved cell                lines.  So in a sense, both of you are counting on these nonapproved                cell lines because they will obviate the need for feeder cell layers                and things of that sort.  But how do you view these being used in                the future or being of benefit or are they only going to be of use                outside of the United States and not be available for use for American                citizens?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, let me clarify the premise of                your question.  There's no uncertainty that the current lines                in Menlo Park that we have qualified for human use can go forward                into early stage human trials.  They are robust.  They are clean.                 They differentiate repeatedly in the directions that we want them                to go.                 But they are xenogeneic, and they will eventually die off, we                think.  We have no evidence for that yet, but we think it's                the conservative and appropriate assumption to make, that these                cells, despite their telomerase expression will not be immortal,                as is a tumor cell.                 So for those two reasons, their natural life span and the desire                to improve by taking advantage of what we've learned from the                existing derivation protocols and improving them, putting those                derivation procedures under GMP with completely qualified and pedigreed                reagents so that even the antibody used to purify the growth factor                has never seen a murine antibody; that's what we're talking                about about GMP cell lines.                 And that is a normal progression within the entire field of cell                therapy, and we think we are ahead of everyone in the restricted                arena of embryonic stem cells.  So stay tuned for that announcement.                              The issue, as you correctly point out, is that those cells by                definition of the current government policy will not be available                for study by U.S. government funded entities, and there's no                question, as you correctly imply, that the international community                will be very anxious to get their hands on those cell lines.                  DR. PALMER:   I'd like to add then to that the idea                of heterogeneity.  If you're a publicly funded entity and would                like to explore the utility of these cells and you find that only                a few will perform the way that you are interested in and then only                a few of those will work in a portion of the patients that you are                interested in treating, then the new lines become absolutely critical;                that you could not cure Parkinson's.  You could treat a few                people.  If the cell lines run out, then you're done.                 So it is a critical aspect of expanding the research to a level                where it's self-sustaining.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.                 Michael and then Bill.                  PROF. SANDEL:   This is a question for Dr. Palmer, and it                goes back to something that Paul McHugh said in this morning's                discussion.  He was giving an interpretation, a sympathetic interpretation,                of the President's current policy allowing the use of private                funds but not public funds for new embryonic stem cell lines and                limiting public funding to the preexisting.                 And the way that Paul interpreted that was as a challenge to scientists                to say, ""All right.  Within this limited area, show us what                you can do.  Show us that there's not just speculative promise,                but that there's genuine progress.  Show us.  Let the burden                be on you scientists to show us not only that, but also that redeeming                that progress depends on going beyond the 12 approved stem lines                that are currently available for distribution, and show us also                that redeeming that genuine progress requires federal funding for                more than the existing approved cell lines.""                 Now, much as I heard your comment, you were speaking in that spirit,                addressing that kind of challenge with respect very concretely to                Parkinson's, but I wonder if you could just, taking that challenge                directly of Paul, address to him in a summary way the answer.                 As I understood your testimony just now, you in effect think you                already now have the answer for Paul, and then I'd be interested                to hear Paul's response.                  DR. PALMER:   Let me speak about data that I have seen,                but it's still proprietary and confidential in a general sense.                 In funding stem cell research, about half of our stem cell effort                is in embryonic stem cells, and the remainder divided between adult                stem cells and fetal stem cells.                 Within the embryonic stem cell projects, several of these proposals,                their specific aim was to contrast and compare cell lines that were                available to them, and what we have seen in the data that they present                is that there is beyond a shadow of a doubt huge potential to create                authentic dopamine neurons from human ES cells.                 That's good.  The problem is that within the limited number                of cell lines that they have tested that potential is hugely variable.                 These are cell lines that are theoretically pluripotent, and they                should be equivalent embryonic lines.  If you look at a picture                of them in the dish, they look strikingly different from line to                line, which has the stamp of their history, which cell lines they                have been exposed to, which sera they had applied to them, which                growth factors were used in their preparation in isolation.                 And this history of experience from these ES cells then imprints                them to behave a certain way when their context is suddenly if they're                asked to produce a dopamine neuron.                 So the heterogeneity tells me as a scientist that we have a problem,                that some of these lines may work some of the time for some of the                applications, but they will not all work for all applications.                 And this is a very strong argument for expanding the variety and                the heterogeneity of the lines that we currently have access to.                 Eleven or 12 is not enough.                  DR. McHUGH:   Yes, thank you very much, Michael, for asking                that question because it was rather what I wanted to ask.  But I                have two responses to that.                 First of all, the heterogeneity that you mentioned may or may                not be so compelling as to not allow you to find, after all, these                are immortal cells, and if you get one or two or three lines from                the 12 and the expansion of things that are going, you may well                be able to tell us that you're already achieving with what we                have in front of us adequate things for the future.  That's                the first thing.                 But more importantly to me, anyway, was what you said about the                issues of the autoimmune problem and how you thought that the autoimmune                problem was going to be the telling one as you have seen the cells                die in the process when they're exposed in this way in a foreign                turf and you looked forward to the opportunity perhaps of using                somatic cell nuclear transplantation to develop dopamine cells that                were, in fact, from the person themselves.                 And I wanted to say that I, of course, have spoken in this conference                that I think that that is going to be the way in which embryonic                cells ultimately will — as one of the ways that will get to this                source of cells in ways that we will have to look more closely at                its ethical basis and I see as distinct from the ethical source                that comes from the zygote and the embryonic stem cells that the                President was talking about in his August 9 speech.                 So, Michael, now to return to you, I just think that we've                seen today from these wonderful four presenters just the kinds of                things that I would like to see to enhance our conversation to get                us to a place where we will talk about the direction science will                go and the promise that it will take.                 And let's just finish off by a very small question that I                wanted to ask you, Dr. Palmer, since I've got the floor, and                that was aspects of the biology of Parkinsonism itself and the concern                that I have that perhaps the disorder — are you sure that the disorder                will not in itself being directed against dopamine cells, might                not kill off the stem cells that are being produced and kill them                more quickly than even the endogenous cells?                 So where is the understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism                in relationship to this transplantation treatment?                  DR. PALMER:   Let me turn this around maybe and expand your                horizon in thinking about ES cells, embryonic stem cells, and again                stepping one more step into the nuclear transfer arena or into the                area where you can engineer, genetically modify a traditional embryonic                stem cell.                 So there is no guarantee that making a pure population of dopamine                neurons will cure Parkinson's disease.  There is very good evidence                that under some circumstances dopamine neurons from fetal tissue                do help in Parkinson's disease, and what we would be striving                for is a population that is renewable that would not require the                use of fetuses for curing individuals.                 So in that sense, there is a gold standard that is working relatively                well, but has problems to overcome to which ES cell strategies can                aspire to, and that does work.  And so I am optimistic that the                stem cell strategy will also work, if not better, if we can eliminate                the aspects of the fetal tissue transplant that may be giving us                trouble in that particular clinical paradigm.                 Now, flip-flopping this a little bit, you brought up the idea                that Parkinson's disease is a disease, and putting healthy cells                into the diseased brain may be a bad idea and may not make it work.                 How would you understand the complexities of that disease?                 The way one might approach this is to use ES cells that harbor                all of that genetic complexity of that disease and model it in a                tissue culture dish.  Try your drug screening strategies.  See if                you can't find mechanisms that are not possible to even understand                in a whole organism by recreating the system in the dish.                 This is the real power of ES cell technology.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill — sorry.  Paul, did you want to just                every quickly?                  DR. McHUGH:   No.  Thank you very much for that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, the last question and then                we'll stop.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Well, thank you for your presentations and                the very exciting prospects of going forward with the existing cell                lines and the others that you suggest.  The future looks like it                has real possibilities.                 What I want to explore for a second is beyond the therapeutic                potential.  You've mentioned amazing possibilities for scientific                research and drug testing and so forth.  So even if this technology                doesn't end up making its way into the clinics, it obviously                is going to be very, very important for the whole future of biomedical                science.                 So what I want to ask you is this.  Given this amazing foundational,                early stage of this new medicine, kind of a whole new wing on the                mansion of medicine, and yet given the conflict that is going on                within our culture where, depending on who you believe, which survey                you believe, maybe half the population has problems about the moral                grounding of this future of medicine, here's my question.                 I was speaking with a pediatrician recently, and she told me that                it's not uncommon to have parents whose children are going to                be vaccinated ask her was this vaccine grown on fetal tissues.                 So the problem is that even if the individual patient doesn't                choose to employ the therapy that they have an ethical problem with,                the whole foundation of medicine is going to be built on this technology,                and so it's not just a vaccine that somebody can say, ""Well,                I don't want it.""  It's just sort of like everything                will be built on this, right?                 And beyond the question of whether or not the President could                change his policies, there is the Dickey amendment, and I think                we heard this morning that to a very large extent his decision was                an interpretation of the Dickey amendment itself.                 So given half the population roughly has ethical problems, given                that this is going to be the future foundation of medicine, are                there ways in the kind of research you're doing; do you see                any hopeful ways that we can do this in a way that bypasses the                moral problems?                 And as a part of that question, I'd like to ask you:  how                important do you think cloning for biomedical research is, so-called                therapeutic cloning?                 And recently the work of Gurdon at Cambridge suggested that maybe                you can find the cytoplasmic factors that can down-regulate or reprogram                the nucleus of a somatic cell.  Do you see any hopeful ways out                of this?                 And are there ways we could fund this current research such that                the  moral impasse would be temporary if we could just get it launched                with a good deal of support?                  DR. PALMER:   I do agree with the sentiment entirely.  So                the real issue is how.  Let's take two hypotheticals.                 One is that the U.S. is restricted in its ability to pursue these                technologies on ethical grounds, on moral grounds, yet other countries                are not.  The moral question becomes can you then use the information                and technology that was developed offshore morally.  And that's                something that would have to be discussed.                 We would be far behind in our technologies, in our drug development,                in our ability to provide health care to our constituents.  If we                had the ability to temporarily recognize the value of the lines                of research with the full intent that we need to understand what                these cytoplasmic factors are, nuclear transfer technology is the                prototype.  It is the first working example of taking a genome,                which is totipotent.  So a cell's genome has all of the information                that you need to make an individual.                 My cheek cell, if it has all of its genes, is totipotent, given                the right cytoplasmic factors to program it.  How will you circumvent                this moral problem unless there is a decision or an understanding                that the morality is a combination of concepts and beliefs?                 This is a very difficult question, and I don't envy your task                as Council.  If you were to take a fertilized egg and reprogram                a nucleus, create an embryo out of that to make stem cells, that's                not so technically different than just simply programming the nucleus                to go through all of those steps to create stem cells, and it's                one of an intellectual process coming to grips with a moral stance,                a belief.  It's going to be difficult to separate those two,                I think.                 So technically I think there's great hope to program the genome                in a way that would lead to an embryonic stem cell that's pluripotent.                 The prototype of that is nuclear transfer technology, and that is                the technology that's going to give you those steps to get from                Point A to Point B without creating the embryo.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Within the constraints of existing policy,                do you think we could if we funded it properly find a way to do                that?                  DR. PALMER:   It could happen tomorrow or it could be years.                 It will happen offshore regardless.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thanks to our four panelists for your presentations,                your forthcomingness.  Thanks to the Council members for enduring                a long, but very interesting day.

The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 2-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease DIETARY FACTORS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: TRANSLATION TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENT  Spring 2003  Donald E. Schmechel, M.D. Director and Principal Investigator Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Bryan ADRC) Professor of Medicine (Neurology) Duke University School of Medicine The basic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is that the occurrence of disease in a given person is a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors operating over long periods of time. Like hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, there are probable long periods of time where silent tissue injury occurs before clinical disease may present due to a catastrophic event or loss of final reserve. These long periods of silent and progressive tissue injury are influenced by genetic factors and environmental factors. The most common genetic risk factor is inheritance of one copy (25% of the population) or two copies (2% of the population) of the AD risk gene apolipoprotein E4. However, even the high risk E4/4 persons (two copies) may vary in onset of clinical AD from age 48 to age 80+ or even escape altogether. There must be other environmental factors or other unknown genetic factors. Current research suggests that diet (an environmental factor) may be the major contributor to the rate of silent tissue injury during aging and age of onset of AD. The Western-style diet of industrialized nations is high in bad fats and cholesterol. The demand for fast food, prepared food, `good tasting food', and big food portions has produced an epidemic of diabetes and obesity, and it is a factor for cancer, atherosclerosis, and now AD as well. At no time in history have so many people lived for so long consuming `bad fuel' for their bodies. Our genetic background is not prepared for the combination of these extremes. DIETARY FACTORS: HIGH FAT AND CHOLESTEROL High levels of dietary fat and cholesterol increase AD pathology in transgenic mice models, in primate models and in preliminary studies in humans. More specifically, current evidence supports the specific effect of high cholesterol, saturated fats or trans fatty acids in generating this risk. In human epidemiological studies, consumption of saturated fat or trans fatty acid increases incident risk of AD by about two times after adjusting for all other factors like gender, age, education, and APOE genotype. Likewise, consumption of healthier fats (polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids) is associated with decreased risk of AD. For most people, this is equivalent to eating fish every week. Important studies in African-Americans and Nigerians have suggested that populations on traditional, agrarian diets have much reduced risk of AD (Hendrie et.al, 2001). In animal studies, the risk difference related to type and amount of fat absorption appears to be significant. In a randomized controlled experiment of a high fat, high cholesterol (average American) diet in primates, only those animals on saturated fat diet with low HDL (good cholesterol) manifested AD pathology after five years of the diet (equivalent to humans on 20-30 years of diet). Although much work remains, this dietary effect may well be multi-factorial. Dietary factors may involve peripheral and brain metabolism and damage/injury repair to blood vessels. The modulating effect of HDL in primates would support the role of other genetic factors that affect lipid metabolism. Current trials with statins (drugs that lower cholesterol) are pharmaceutical ways of influencing the role of cholesterol and body lipids on AD risk. Important diet parameters may include: type of fat consumed, levels of good (HDL) and bad (LDL) cholesterol. The diet of many Americans is high in bad fats and cholesterol and constitutes a risk for AD that many be independent of APOE genetic risk factors, but related to genetic risk for low HDL levels. Many persons on American diets (60%) qualify for treatment of high cholesterol levels under current guidelines. The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 3-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease DIETARY FACTORS: IRON OVERLOAD  Spring 2003  Average American diets have iron supplementation in many prepared foods. Most persons have increasing body iron stores over time with men increasing from birth and most women blunted at low levels until after menopause (due to menstruation and childbirth). These levels approach 300-600 ppm of iron in liver (young persons with iron stores adequate for red cell formation average about 100-200 ppm). The average American diet is supplemented to roughly five to ten times more than the minimal daily requirement of 2 mg per day, primarily through addition of iron to bread, cereals and processed food. In addition, the combination of high fat, high cholesterol diets result in increased iron stores. The common hemochromatosis gene (Hfe), which is usually clinically silent just like apolipoprotein E4, may be a genetic risk factor for AD. The Hfe effect may be to decrease age of onset by five years, a more modest effect than the APOE4 allele, which decreases age of onset by roughly ten years per allele. Like APOE4, the `carrier' state or person with a single risk gene copy out of two possible is common: Hfe gene 10% of population are carriers of C282Y polymorphism; APOE gene, 2030% of population are carriers of APOE4 polymorphism. This Hfe gene is associated with risk of dietary iron overload on common American diets and it is also affected by common hepatitis C infection (1% of population) and alcoholism. Although the Hfe gene is a `Caucasian' gene from Western Europe, many persons presenting with AD have abnormal indices of iron metabolism (roughly 40-50%) consistent with tendency to tissue overload and too much circulating free iron. Reducing iron intake to levels sufficient for red cell formation and/or getting rid of excess body iron by blood donation may be important factors in decreasing risk attributable to iron overload. CDC guidelines call for consideration of therapeutic phlebotomy for persons with serum ferritin levels of greater than 200 ng/ml at younger age ranges or with clinical disease. The diet of many Americans is high in iron and/or fat and this produces high body stores of iron and probably increased risk of AD. DIETARY FACTORS: HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS An important outcome of the Framingham Heart Study was the identification of increased plasma homocysteine levels as an eventual risk factor for AD. Homocysteine is a normal metabolite of liver and cellular metabolism involved in recycling of sulfur and high-energy compounds used by the body for synthesis. Vitamins such as folic acid (folate), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) are cofactors for some of the enzymes affecting homocysteine metabolism. Low folic acid may contribute to elevations of homocysteine, which can damage blood vessels at higher levels. Folic acid replacement of 400 mcg to 2 mg per day can reverse these elevated levels in most cases (sometimes B6 and B12 supplements are also used). A very common polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme) may contribute to higher levels of homocysteine. Recent papers have suggested that elevated homocysteine in patients presenting with apparent AD may be associated with white matter injury on MRI and a `vascular' component to dementia even in the absence of clinically recognized stroke-like events. Thus, many cases of AD (up to 30-40%) may be accompanied by significant white matter disease or vascular dementia component. Elevated homocysteine may be one marker for this type of AD and is apparently preventable if identified and treated in the decades prior to AD onset. Trials are underway to understand the utility of treating this abnormality once the clinically evident part of the disease process has commenced. The diet of many Americans results in higher levels of homocysteine. The addition of folic acid (and sometimes B6 and B12) can control this risk for vascular injury and AD [Women in childbearing age are already encouraged to supplement folic acid to reduce risk of birth defects].  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 4-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease  Spring 2003  DIETARY FACTORS: PLASMA THIAMINE, ALCOHOL, GLYCEMIC FOODS Intermediate metabolism may be a significant risk factor for vascular dementia and AD. Plasma thiamine levels and thiamine supply to the brain can be endangered classically by starvation, foods such as shelled rice without vitamin supplements, in diabetic persons with high blood sugars during a phase of insulin adjustment, or alcoholism. Glycemic foods (those foods high in simple carbohydrates) produce quick rises in blood sugar and insulin resistance over time. In addition, a number of persons not in the above categories come to Duke's Memory Disorders Clinic with low thiamine indices. Some of these people have mild gait ataxia, but lack the full symptoms of severe thiamine deficiency like confusion, ataxia, problems with eye movements, or heart failure. Our current practice is to supplement these persons with additional oral thiamine (vitamin b1) above MDA levels of 1.5 mg/day until a normal range of plasma thiamine levels are reached (usually 25-100 mg/day). SUMMARY: THE CHALLENGE OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES A number of dietary factors may affect risk of AD. These factors include dietary fat and cholesterol, particularly the bad fatty acids (saturated fat and trans-fatty acid), dietary iron overload, elevated homocysteine levels, and thiamine deficiency. All of these factors are independent sources of risk with some modulation by genetic factors (e.g., fat intake and HDL levels, dietary iron intake and Hfe gene). These dietary factors represent environmental risk of AD and vascular dementia whose modulation either before or during disease may alter disease risk and course of illness. Even with incompletely altered diet, dietary modification may decrease need for medication (e.g., lower dose of statins needed with dietary changes and exercise). Environmental modification is possible through lifestyle changes, whereas genetic risk factors are not modifiable. I. What is average American bad diet? A. High in calories B. High in simple, refined carbohydrates (sugar, corn syrup, fructose) C. High in saturated fats and trans-fatty acid and low in fish/vegetables D. High in supplemented iron, other food additives and preservatives Issues: Speed, convenience, social or emotional eating, larger portions Downside: Crash diets to recover, production of diabetes, hyperinsulinism, metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, obesity, atherosclerosis and heart disease risk, increased cancer risk, subclinical inflammation, increased risk of AD (saturated or trans-fatty acids) Genetics vs. Environmental: Even persons with potentially low genetic risk may be `pushed' into AD on these diets; statins or similar drugs might counteract such bad diets. are current directions for improving the American diet? Reduction of calories  a variety of diets Increasing portions of fruits and vegetables  complex, non- glycemic carbohydrates Reduction of saturated fats and trans-fatty acids Increase intake of vegetables or fish high in unsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-3 Reduction of unneeded supplements such as iron (men), food additives, and preservatives Issues: Slower food preparation, harder to eat out in restaurants, spoilage Downside: Many potential diets, difficulties in sticking to a diet, dieting in face of pressure from social customs, friends and family. Genetics vs. Environmental: Current evidence suggests that such diets will decrease incidence of AD and related disorders (e.g., vascular dementia) with relatively modest changes or alterations to diet; might result in decreased need for medications  II. What A. B. C. D. E.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 5-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease III. What types of diets might radically minimize risk of Alzheimer's disease?  Spring 2003  A. Traditional diets: Okinawa Diet, Mediterranean Diet, basic regional diets using moderation and natural food stocks B. Reduction of saturated fat and trans-fatty acid intake  dramatically less intake of butter, marbled meats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, and pastries may decrease risk of AD. The risk for people with increased intake of these foods is roughly two times those of people on traditional diets. C. Reduction of Homocysteine  leafy vegetables, greens and folic acid supplementation. The risk for increased homocysteine to cause AD is roughly two times more for persons with high homocysteine levels. D. Increased use of fish oil or omega-3 in vegetables (e.g., flax seed) or supplements. The decreased risk for persons eating fish or using omega-3 supplements is roughly two times less than those who don't eat fish or use supplements. E. Caloric restriction; avoidance of simple carbohydrates  avoiding hyperinsulinism, syndrome X or metabolic syndrome, vascular risk Issues: Same as II. on last page. Downside: Same as II. on last page. Genetics vs. Environmental: Relatively uncharted territory, may well markedly decrease incidence of AD and related disorders (e.g., vascular dementia) with significant changes or alterations to diet or reduced need for medications. Only persons at highest genetic risk might still be untouched by such dietary modifications and still need medication or therapy (for example, rare cases of genetic autosomal dominant AD or E4/4 persons with other environmental factors such as head injury). IV: WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEART IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN Basic Diet: Discuss with your health care provider and your family. Key: Can you stick to the diet over time? Can you afford it? Does it meet your specific health and medication needs? V. What about Supplements?  Multiple vitamin probably recommended as one ages  Folate supplementation 400 mcg or more  Thiamine supplementation (in my opinion, 25 mg or more)  Total reduction of iron intake to no supplements after age 50 unless there is specific need (e.g., iron deficiency anemia) Are       VI.  there special recommendations for those at risk of dementia or stroke? Use of antiplatelet agent such as coated aspirin 81-162 mg/day (check with physician) Fish oil supplement (omega-3) through reputable source or diet high in fatty fish Folate supplement at 1 mg/day or check of homocysteine level Thiamine replacement at 25 mg/day or check of thiamine level Vitamin E supplementation at 400 1200 IU per day (probably `healthy' diet low in saturated fats mitigates this need) References: www.navigator.tufts.edu good source of nutritional information Seshadri S.

The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 8-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  ""WAIT A MINUTE!"" When Anger Gets too Much Wait a Minute! ""In the last few days even something little sets me off. I find myself yelling all the time. Then of course I end up feeling guilty. Poor Jim. He doesn't deserve this."" You may be exhausted. When you are rested and fit, you feel good about yourself, you're more tolerant of common irritants, more accepting of annoying behaviors, and you tend to see more options for solving problems. Try to get some rest or a break from the caregiving routine. Wait a Minute! ""Last night I actually broke three of my best wine goblets. I just needed to hit or break something. This morning I feel so foolish. I'm also mad at my husband. I know that's unreasonable. Why do I need somebody to blame?"" Sometimes when we feel helpless or at a loss to control a situation, we feel better if we blame someone or something. You have a right to be angry at the situation but remember your husband is not the problem. Blame the disease. Healthy ways to express and work off anger: Go for a walk, bake or cook something that takes time and attention, call a friend, pray, clean a closet or whatever works for you. Wait a Minute! ""More and more I feel empty inside, like I have no feelings, no pleasure in anything. I also have this fear that one day I am going to explode, and all these feelings are going to come from somewhere deep inside. It is frightening because I am afraid that something dreadful will happen."" When we are running on empty, all emotions are dulled. We are just too tired to feel anything. It does not mean that anger, fear, and sadness are not there. Reach out. Get help. You can feel better. If family help is not available, look for paid services in your community. Wait a Minute ! ""There are things he does that set me off. `He's doing this to spite me.' I see them coming and yet, I respond the same way every time."" Wait a minute. Count to ten before you respond. This really works. Maybe he needs reassurance, more structure (or less structure) a job or an activity that he can do without the expectation of perfection or standards that he can no longer attain, and appreciation for things he can still do. He also needs affection though it may be hard to be affectionate when you are mad. What are those things that always make you mad? Can these be changed in any way so they are less upsetting to you? The only option may be to change your attitude about these triggers. Wait a Minute! ""I know that life is not fair but it still makes me so mad! Almost every day, I ask: `Why us?' `Why her?' And then there's that awful answer from out of somewhere, `Why not you?' `Why not her?'"" Alzheimer's robs so much from the person who has it and from those who love and care for him or her. Keeping journals is one small way of responding: Write down all the good things you want to remember--some may be funny, some painful, some totally new information to other members of the family. In a separate journal write about the problems, losses, challenges, the anger and the triumphs of the caregiving journey. This may help maintain your perspective and sense of control. Families report that these journals become treasures later.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 9-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  Wait a Minute! ""I am furious at the nursing home but I am afraid to say anything. If I have to move dad again, I don't know what I'll do. Today was the last straw. I walked in to see him and they had cut off all of his hair. It was as if someone had decided that this was one way not to have to give him another haircut. I wanted to cry. He was always so particular about his hair."" Always speak up when there is a problem or concern about your family member's care. The trick is knowing how. First, wait until you have calmed down, if you are angry. It may help to write down all of the issues to help you focus clearly. Focus only on the current concern, not everything that has been bothering you the whole year. Go to the right person first. If you are upset with the nursing assistant, talk first to him or her. Let her tell her side and LISTEN. You may be unaware of extenuating circumstances. If you are still not satisfied, talk to her supervisor, then the administrator, then the ombudsman-- an ideal advocate for your family member. You may even want to start with the ombudsman if you are afraid of rocking the boat in the nursing home. Wait a Minute ! ""I am so tired of cleaning up behind him and everything else I have to do over and over and over. It's never ending and I'm past the boiling point."" Decide what's worth doing and what you can give up. Delegate what you can and do only what's necessary. Lower your standards. Get rid of everything you don't use or need. Order brings a sense of control but should not be at the cost of drudgery. Wait a Minute! ""I have to do everything myself. My mother has five children--my four brothers don't think Mom has a problem. The only good thing about this disease is that she's not aware of their terrible behavior. Their only concern seems to be whether or not I am spending her money frivolously on her care."" You cannot make your brothers share in your mother's care. You ask and then emotionally let it go when they refuse. You can only learn to make the job as easy for you as possible. For now, get a durable power-of-attorney for health care, and plan for facility care if that becomes necessary. Keep meticulous records of spending for her and show them to your brothers. Try a to-do calendar: taking Mom to the doctor one Tuesday a month, picking her up from the Adult Day Center at 3 p.m. each day. If she lives alone, assign maintenance chores such as cutting grass or picking up groceries. Let each of your brothers choose what he will be responsible for. Wait a Minute! ""I'm trying. Nobody seems to appreciate that. My children and everybody just tell me what I'm doing wrong. Taking care of Amy is a full time job. Sure I've yelled at her a few times. Last night I shook her really hard. I took her to the toilet and when I went back to check on her she had made a mess everywhere except in the toilet. Like lightening I lost it. My kids talk psychology, but not one of them wipes butts. All of us need information or help if we care. It's not always easy even when you know HOW to do a job--to bathe the person, how to get her to eat, to use the toilet ..... The experts tell us that giving care is hard because we not only care for the person ( like helping with bathing or taking to the toilet) but we care about the person (like loving a wife and hurting when we see what's happening to her). We forget that the first and maybe even the most important job is keeping ME, the caregiver, well so that anger doesn't take over as easily when the going gets rough. Wait a Minute! ""You tell me to take care of myself. How do I do that and what good would that do?"" Go to support groups where others in the same boat have good ideas. Take mini vacations even if they are planned, regular ""daydream excursions."" Laugh. Get real breaks by actually getting away for a while. Think of your body as a machine and make a special effort to take care of it. It's not unlike taking care of your car. How far would you get without gas or water in your car? Eat regular meals for the energy you need. Sleep to repair the wear and tear of the day. Exercise regularly--this is a great way to build strength and work off anger. Finally, learn to accept things that you cannot change. Learn how to triumph, even in small ways, despite what you can't change.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 10-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  Wait a Minute! Write the name and number of one or two people you can call on to listen without giving advice or comment. Most people don't know how to just listen. Make a contract, explaining to your friend that you just need someone to listen and understand what you are going through at the moment. One wife called this her ""bitching partner"" a woman she could call anytime when she needed to rant and rave and hang up once she calmed down. _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ __ From the: Duke Family Support Program and the Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Box 3600 DUMC Durham, North Carolina 27710 (919) 660-7510 Toll-free in NC ONLY: (800) 672-4213 Editor's Note : "" Wait a Minute!"" is a draft of a 2003 two-sided, laminated refrigerator magnet for overwhelmed family caregivers.

He visited time and time again Sneaking soundlessly into our house and stealing our treasure, Taking a piece of you on each stealthy visit Robbing you of your cognition, emotions, and memories In essence, he stole your core. I felt angry cheated and robbed How dare this thief steal you from me! You were taken from me too soon. You were gone before I was able to acknowledge your wisdom, strengths and gifts. The thief committed his crimes before I was mature enough to appreciate all that you were. I feel guilty. I have lived with that guilt for a long time But I am in a different place now Our family was robbed But not really You were stolen However, you do still exist You exist in your children I see you every day in my brothers, my sisters and in myself. When I lend a hand to a neighbor When I give a difficult person the benefit of the doubt When I actively participate in the political process When I find the strength in myself to get through one more difficult day When I speak up for those who cannot find their voices And When I fight for equal rights for ALL people. That is you, Mom On one hand, you are gone Yet, you still live on You lit the fire in my soul with creativity, compassion, strength and fearlessness And for that I thank you and I will love you forever. Anonymous North Carolina Daughter Submitted by a proud father The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 12-   Facts: About Depression and AD  Spring 2003  Facts:  About depression and Alzheimer's disease  Prepared by the Clinical Issues and Interventions Work Group of the Alzheimer's Association. February 10, 2003.  Experts estimate that clinically significant depression occurs in about 20 to 40 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with Alzheimer's have the same right to adequate diagnosis and treatment of depression as any other person who develops the disorder. Treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease can improve sense of well-being, quality of life, and individual function, even in the presence of ongoing decline in memory and thinking. There are many potentially effective non-drug and drug therapies available and the benefits of treatment justify the cost. Features of depression in Alzheimer's disease Identifying depression in Alzheimer's disease can be difficult. There is no single test or questionnaire to detect the condition and diagnosis requires careful evaluation of a variety of possible symptoms. Dementia itself can lead to certain symptoms commonly associated with depression, including apathy, loss of interest in activities and hobbies, and social withdrawal and isolation. The cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer's often makes it difficult for them to articulate their sadness, hopelessness, guilt, and other feelings associated with depression. Although depression in Alzheimer's is often similar in its severity and duration to the disorder in people without dementia, in some cases it may be less severe, not last as long, or not recur as often. Depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's may come and go, in contrast to memory and thinking problems that worsen steadily over time. People with Alzheimer's and depression may be less likely to talk openly about wanting to kill themselves and they are less likely to attempt suicide than depressed individuals without dementia. Men and women with Alzheimer's experience depression with about equal frequency. Diagnosis and proposed diagnostic criteria for ""depression of Alzheimer's disease"" The first step in diagnosis is a thorough professional evaluation. Side effects of medications or an unrecognized medical condition can sometimes produce symptoms of depression. Key elements of the evaluation will include a review of the person's medical history, a physical and mental examination, and interviews with family members who know the person well. Because of the complexities involved in diagnosing depression in someone with Alzheimer's, it may be helpful to consult a geriatric psychiatrist who specializes in recognizing and treating depression in older adults. A group of investigators with extensive experience in studying and treating both late life The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 13-   Facts: About Depression and AD  Spring 2003  depression and dementia, working under the sponsorship of the U. S . National Institute of Mental Health, has proposed diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder called ""depression of Alzheimer's disease."" These criteria are designed to provide a consistent basis for research as well as to aid in identifying people with Alzheimer's who are also depressed. Although the criteria are similar to general diagnostic standards for major depression, they reduce emphasis on verbal expression and include irritability and social isolation. To meet these criteria, someone must have, in addition to an Alzheimer's diagnosis, a change in functioning characterized by three or more of the following symptoms during the same two-week period. The symptoms must include at least one of the first two on the list--depressed mood or decreased pleasure in usual activities.            Significantly depressed mood--sad, hopeless, discouraged, tearful. Decreased positive feelings or reduced pleasure in response to social contacts and usual activities. Social isolation or withdrawal. Disruption in appetite that is not related to another medical condition. Disruption in sleep (a fact sheet about sleep changes in Alzheimer's disease is also available from the Alzheimer's Association). Agitation or slowed behavior (a fact sheet about agitation and Alzheimer's disease is also available from the Association). Irritability. Fatigue or loss of energy. Feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness, or inappropriate or excessive guilt. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicide plans, or a suicide attempt.  Treating depression in Alzheimer's disease The most common treatment for depression in Alzheimer's involves a combination of medicine, support, and gradual reconnection of the person to activities and people he or she finds pleasurable. Simply telling the person with Alzheimer's to ""cheer up,"" "" snap out of it,"" or ""try harder"" is seldom helpful. Depressed people with or without Alzheimer's are rarely able to make themselves better by sheer will or without lots of support, reassurance, and professional help. The following sections suggest non-drug strategies and medications that often prove helpful in treating depression in Alzheimer's. Non-drug approaches       Schedule a predictable daily routine, taking advantage of the person's best time of day to undertake difficult tasks, such as bathing. Make a list of activities, people, or places that the person enjoys now and schedule these things more frequently. Help the person exercise regularly, particularly in the morning. Acknowledge the person's frustration or sadness, while continuing to express hope that he or she will feel better soon. Celebrate small successes and occasions.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 14-   Facts: About Depression and AD   Spring 2003      Find ways that the person can contribute to family life and be sure to recognize his or her contributions. At the same time, provide reassurance that the person is loved, respected, and appreciated as part of the family, and not just for what she or he can do now. Nurture the person with offers of favorite foods or soothing or inspirational activities. Reassure the person that he or she will not be abandoned. Consider supportive psychotherapy and/or a support group, especially an early-stage group for people with Alzheimer's who are aware of their diagnosis and prefer to take an active role in seeking help or helping others.  Pharmaceutical approaches Physicians often prescribe antidepressants for treatment of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's. The most commonly used medications are in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These include citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac). Physicians may also prescribe antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of brain chemicals other than serotonin, including venlafaxine (sold as Effexor and Effexor-SR), mirtazapine ( Remeron) and bupropion (Wellbutrin0 ). Antidepressants in a class called the tricyclics, which includes nortnptyline (Pamelor) and desipramine (Norpramine ), are no longer used as first-choice treatments, but are sometimes used when individuals do not benefit from other medications Where can I get more information? The proposed diagnostic criteria for ""depression of Alzheimer's disease"" are described in: Olin, J.T.; Schneider, L.S.; Katz, I.R.; et al.

No matter how much we understand that Alzheimer's steals names and short-circuits the wires that connect head and heart to tongue we still slip into using names and wanting the words, I am gifted with how well my head and heart can connect and build words into bridges that can carry us over the gulfs that separate us from understanding the gifts revealed in a moment, an experience, another, My gift with words opens me even more to the tragedy of Alzheimer's when no matter how well I build my bridge from my side there's no firm ground across the chasm I can reach, my heart can get across, and I have to shut up to words and just be there with Mother, smile to her eyes, kiss her cheek, act to do so that she can be, when we are moved as deep as we can fathom we build what bridges we can without words: cakes and casseroles after a death or during an illness, a hug and a kiss on the cheek after being separated or after a wedding, a tear if we can let ourselves, a laugh when it's just so right, or just so absurd, and sometimes all that we can do is inside with no discernible bridge, no ready clue to others as to where our heart and head are taking us, maybe Alzheimer's can help us all grow larger in how we feel and larger in appreciating how varied the ways to span the gulf between us and all that's out there.

CALL TO ORDER  Dr. Hodes introduced Dr. Myron Weisfeldt and Dr. Rose Dobrof, new members of the National Advisory Council on Aging (NACA). Dr. Weisfeldt is Chairman, Department of Medicine, and Professor at Columbia University, New York and a cardiologist. Dr. Dobrof is a Brookdale Professor of Gerontology, Brookdale Center on Aging, Hunter College, New York.  Dr. Hodes announced that Ms. June McCann, NIA Committee Management Officer and Executive Secretary of the Council, is retiring after 22 years with NIA. He and the entire Council expressed their appreciation and good wishes. Future Meeting Dates September 23-24, 1999 (Thursday-Friday) February 8-9, 2000 (Tuesday-Wednesday) May 25-26, 2000 (Thursday-Friday) September 27-28, 2000 (Wednesday-Thursday) February 6-7, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) May 22-23, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) September 25-26, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) Consideration of Minutes of Last Meeting The minutes of the September 23-24, 1998 meeting were approved as submitted.  3   Director's Status Report Dr. Hodes reviewed NIA's FY99 budget and the FY 2000 budget requested by the President. Specific budget information is appended to these Minutes. He noted the instability of budget increases, so that a year with a higher budget allocation often is followed by a year with a much smaller increase. This instability makes budgetary planning difficult. In FY 1999, the NIA budget for Research Centers increased by 10%, the first increase in many years. Since the projected budget for FY 2000 is for no increase in Research Centers, NIA will make an effort to assure an equivalent funding level will become available for Centers that compete in FY 2000. Although the success rate for grant applications fluctuates, it is more stable from year to year than are budget increments. A substantial increase is allocated to the intramural research program for opening a clinical research unit at the Bayview campus in Baltimore in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. Overall, Dr. Hodes expressed confidence that the research community is submitting high quality applications that have the potential to make excellent use of budgetary increases. In discussion, Council pointed out that it was anticipated that NIH budget increases would continue for several years. Now, with the FY 2000 budget increase projected to be approximately 2%, the research community is faced with little prospect of support for the increased number of applications that it was encouraged to submit. It was also observed that even with a likely budget increase of 17% over 2 years, the research community has generated so many applications or applications that are so costly that the success rate has not changed. In discussion of whether NIA and NIH are able to manage a major single year budget increase appropriately, the sense of Council was that there are sufficient meritorious applications awaiting funding and that there is an opportunity to respond to equipment and other infrastructure needs. II. APPLICABILITY OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO GRANT RECIPIENTS  Ms. Diana Jaeger, Acting Director, Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA) briefed the Council on implications of an extension of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to grantees' research data. The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill included a provision that directed the Office of Management and Budget to amend OMB Circular A-110 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations) to extend the FOIA to require that Federal awarding agencies assure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public. Further, if the agency obtaining the data does so at the request of a private party, a reasonable user fee may be charged. Ms. Jaeger noted that NIH supports the sharing of research data but feels it is essential that concepts be clarified to assure data integrity, confidentiality for research participants, the intellectual and the financial investments of the researchers, and the continuation of research.  4   Ms. Jaeger told Council that an NIH Working Group is developing a response to the proposed legislation, and that when a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) is issued, NIH will comment through DHHS and to OMB directly. She emphasized that NIH perceives this amendment as a major science policy issue. Therefore, NIH is informing the research community of the change and is encouraging organizations and individuals to keep informed and to comment to OMB. In discussion, Council members could foresee many implications of the legislative change. For example, the Health Care Financing Administration and other organizations might be reluctant to share data with researchers. If those doing secondary analyses of existing data sets were required to pay fees, where would the funds come from? Other members wondered about whether biological materials constitute data, and the value of data as intellectual property. Drs. Hazzard and Blau agreed to draft a statement for Council to forward to OMB and to the Deputy Director for Extramural Research, NIH. III. INTRAMURAL PROGRAM REVIEW  Dr. Dan Longo, Scientific Director, reminded Council that the Intramural Research Program is reviewed by the Board of Scientific Counselors. Each review encompasses two laboratories, so that each program is reviewed about every four years. Individual NACA members serve as ad hoc reviewers for the Board. He reported that the program overall was reviewed favorably by a Blue Ribbon Panel appointed by the Director, NIH, and that the report of that review was sent to Council members. Two laboratories reported to Council, the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition. The Laboratory of Molecular Genetics (LMG) is investigating the molecular basis for aging and age-dependent diseases. Studies are focused on DNA-related mechanisms such as DNA repair, replication and transcription, and genomic instability. The increased occurrence of DNA damage that has been observed with increasing age in many biological systems may be due to changes in DNA repair. LMG has a special interest in the fine structure of DNA repair which includes the study of the DNA repair processes in individual genes. Dr. Vilhelm Bohr, the Chief of LMG, noted that premature aging syndromes such as Werner's and Cockayne's are excellent biological model systems for the molecular study of aging. Researchers in the laboratory have found defects in DNA repair and in basal transcription in cells from patients with Cockayne syndrome. They have purified the Werner protein and biochemically characterized its activity, which involves the unwinding of DNA (helicase). Dr. Bohr also discussed work on DNA damage in Alzheimer's disease; on the role of the P21 protein; on possible changes in ribosomal DNA in humans; and on the process of somatic hypermutation. He described clinical longitudinal research in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging exploring whether the genome becomes less stable with increasing age. Finally, he indicated that Dr. Seidman has joined the lab and has started a program studying triplex oligonucleotide structures. These can be used to target specific genes in DNA and to provide  5   a mechanism for targeted knockout of particular genes that are implicated in aging, thus allowing their role in the aging process to be addressed. The Laboratory of Personality and Cognition conducts basic and clinical research on individual differences in cognitive and personality processes and traits. The laboratory investigates the influence of age on these variables and their reciprocal influence on health, well-being, and adaptation. It employs longitudinal, experimental, and epidemiological methods in the analysis of psychological and psychosocial issues of aging, including health and illness, predictors of intellectual competence and decline, models of adult personality, and correlates of disease risk factors. Dr. Paul Costa, Chief of the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition, reported that the Personality, Stress and Coping Section has conducted systematic basic research in personality guided by the Five Factor Model (FFM) which asserts that personality traits can be understood as aspects of 5 factors: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. He reported that the model is now the prevailing conception of personality in psychological research. He described work using the model that indicates that some changes in personality may be early indicators of Alzheimer's disease. He also described a large cross-cultural study showing consistency of factor structure in the model across cultures. However, the study did show some consistent changes in personality in adulthood in some cultures other than the U.S. In the cognition section, performance of Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) participants on the Benton Visual Retention Test has led to the test's identification as a potential early marker for Alzheimer's disease. That finding is being followed up using neuroimaging techniques. Finally, he described ongoing work investigating whether estrogen provides a protective effect on memory. IV. NIH DIRECTOR'S AFTERNOON LECTURE  James P. Smith, Ph.D., Senior Economist at RAND and an NIA MERIT Awardee, delivered a lecture on the results from the pilot study for the New Immigrant Survey (NIS-P) on February 3, 1999 as part of the NIH Director's Wednesday Afternoon Lecture series. The NIS-P is the first step in a plan to carry out a comprehensive, multi-cohort longitudinal survey of new legal immigrants to the U.S. and their children. Dr. Smith, the Principal Investigator of this project which is funded by three Federal agencies including NIH, presented the goal of the study: to advance understanding of the socioeconomic status of immigrants from a wide range of countries and their effects on the U.S., including on public health and on a number of health conditions of interest to the NIH. The longitudinal data collected will permit tracking the mobility and adaptation of the immigrants and their children to the U.S. Dr. Smith presented some results from the NIS-P on the health, schooling, language skills, and earnings of legal immigrants, and discussed challenges in conducting a survey of this kind.  6   V.  REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS  This portion of the meeting was closed to the public in accordance with the determination that it was concerned with matters exempt from mandatory disclosure under Sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), Title 5, U.S. Code and Section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. Appendix).2 A total of 793 applications requesting $646,138,782 for all years was reviewed. Council recommended 586 for a total of $489,797,485 for all years. The actual funding of the awards recommended is determined by the availability of funds, percentile ranks, priority scores, and program relevance. VI. TASK FORCE ON TRAINING  Dr. Blau introduced the recommendations of the Task Force on Training by describing the reasons for the formation of the Task Force and its membership. She presented the recommendations for approval by Council. After discussion of the appropriate benchmark with which to compare National Research Service Award (NRSA) stipends; of the best means to support junior scientists who are beyond the immediate postdoctoral years; of salary restrictions on career awards; and of the relative merits of training on training grants and training on research grants, Council approved the following recommendations: 1. The Task Force (NACA) recognizes that the recent substantial increase in NRSA stipends for predoctoral and postdoctoral students has significantly addressed the need for adequate stipends for research trainees. At the same time, the Task Force (NACA) recommends continuing diligence in ensuring that stipends remain adequate in future years. At the postdoctoral level, parity with NIH intramural stipends is recommended as an appropriate standard. 2. The NIA should broaden the definition of appropriate training for aging research to include training in the late-life diseases and conditions that affect older people, and biological, psychosocial, neuroscientific, and behavioral perspectives on these diseases. 3. The NIA should issue program announcement(s) clarifying the issue of what is appropriate training in aging research, and seeking applications for training in focused areas that recognize the important interdependence of aging research and basic research in biological, clinical, neuroscientific, and psychosocial fields. 4. The NIA should issue guidelines to review committees that encompass an expanded definition of aging research in the context of review of training applications. Where necessary, membership should be expanded to provide appropriate review. 2  For the record, it is noted that members absented themselves from the meeting when the Council discussed applications (a) from their respective institutions or (b) in which a conflict of interest may have occurred. This procedure only applied to applications that were discussed individually, not to ""en bloc"" actions.  7   5. NIA is urged to develop additional materials (such as a web page) highlighting key information that will make Training Directors aware of existing flexibility in the NIA and NIH administration of these programs. 6. NIA should adapt and expand the existing mentored career award mechanism (K01) to allow a track for research scientists and staff scientists as well as faculty. 7. The Task Force (NACA) strongly supports the current broad availability of opportunities for research experience available to predoctoral and postdoctoral students on NIA and NIH research grants. VII. GERIATRICS PROGRAM REVIEW  Dr. Hazzard reported on the review of the Geriatrics Program. He complimented the staff, particularly for the degree to which they have formed collaborations both within the extramural programs at NIA and across the NIH. Geriatrics is a broad and multidisciplinary subject area and without these collaborations, he noted, the program would risk becoming superficial, isolated, or redundant. He then reported on the four sections of the program that had been reviewed. Cancer. Reviewers recommended that the program develop a formal arrangement with NCI in which NCI commits resources to the study of cancer and aging. Also panel members suggested that NIA resume collaboration with the Veterans' Administration to focus on tumors that have a high incidence in older men. Regarding initiative development, reviewers recommended both a broad announcement focused on treatment in the elderly across a wide variety of tumor types, and more focused announcements on use of adjuvant therapies; on the biology associated with cancer in the elderly (with the Biology of Aging Program), and on the uses of radiation therapy. Reviewers also recommended additional funding for the program area. Osteoporosis. Reviewers commented on the breadth of the portfolio in osteoporosis and endocrinology. They said that the portfolio is too broad for a single individual to lead and urged that the osteoporosis and endocrinology portfolios each be assigned a program administrator. They identified research challenges in the field, including better definition of the roles of calcium, Vitamin D, and estrogen, and of the mechanisms of accelerated bone loss in old age. They identified needs for further study of the role of nutrition in osteoporosis; of the nature of gender differences in bone biology, pathogenesis, and treatment of osteoporosis; of improved methods of diagnosis and screening; and of new methods to measure the expression of local factors that regulate bone turnover and strength. They recommended small-scale studies and analyses of existing data sets to address these opportunities. They also suggested a cost-benefit analysis of interventions in elderly post-fracture patients. They recommended that a small advisory group be formed to provide multidisciplinary input on future directions including basic science developments that are ready for clinical investigation, and urged that the links between basic biology and the geriatric osteoporosis program be strengthened. They suggested expanding the workshop on Selective Estrogen 8   Receptor Modulators (SERMs) to include SARMs (androgen) and the use of these drugs in both sexes. Musculoskeletal. Given the prevalence of frailty and weakness as contributors to health care needs in the elderly, the program area's focus on sarcopenia is well-founded. However, reviewers suggested a more focused portfolio of research than was offered at the program review meeting. Among areas needing development, reviewers identified exploration of the basic mechanisms, including neural changes, that generate sarcopenia; development of anabolic agents that counteract sarcopenia and minimize harmful effects of testosterone; and analysis of the integrative mechanisms that give rise to the substantial gains achieved by short term training programs on strength and performance. It was pointed out that the Geriatric Program's focus should be chosen in relation to, and in collaboration with, the efforts of the Neuroscience and Biology of Aging programs at NIA and related programs at NIAMS. Reviewers praised the concept and operation of the musculoskeletal working group. They praised the recent workshop on muscle blood flow and saw opportunities for further research in the area, perhaps in collaboration with NHLBI. Reviewers supported the NIA publication: Handbook on Exercise Advice for the Elderly (produced by the NIA Public Information Office with the technical assistance of GP staff). Pepper Centers. The Pepper Center (Older American Independence Centers) program was acknowledged to have created a national focus on Geriatric Medicine and to have contributed substantively to the growth of the field through the success of the Centers' emphasis on career development of promising clinical investigators. Their clinical trial portfolio has focused on important issues related to independence in the elderly, helped by the core resources which have guided research along thematic lines. Reviewers urged that consideration be given to the future development of new directions, with investigators encouraged to propose novel cores, resources and research. Further, reviewers urged that the centers be broadened from their predominantly clinical base to include basic as well as behavioral and social science. The flat budget was considered detrimental to the Program. Reviewers recommended a rate of growth of about one center every three years. Dr. Hazzard concluded his review by noting that the reviewers consider that the program on geriatrics has provided the Institute with an excellent return on investment and should be continued with modest growth and no major change in strategy. In discussion, Council members raised several topics including pharmacokinetics, excessive disability, obesity, the role of poverty, and the provision of home care. Dr. Hazzard indicated that the wealth of possible topics underlines the need for the program to focus its agenda. VIII. NACA TASK FORCE ON MINORITY AGING RESEARCH Dr. Jackson reported that the NACA Task Force on Minority Aging Research had discussed three topics: Monitoring the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research; the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research; and the forthcoming review of minority aging research planned for the Council meeting in September 1999. NIA staff provided updates on NIA outreach activities. 9   Monitoring the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. Council members were provided figures showing by ethnicity and gender the numbers of participants in clinical research supported by NIA. Dr. Jackson reported concerns with the data that limit its usefulness. For example, the system tracks cumulative data from the point of recruitment although there is no indication whether subjects who were initially recruited completed the study; the data are skewed by very large population based studies; and data entry as well as decisions about which studies to include are made by many different people, probably resulting in inconsistent data. Discussion focused on what response is appropriate. One proposal was to share the concerns with the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) who designed the system for entering and monitoring the data. Dr. Jackson proposed working with a small group of NIA staff who would coordinate with ORWH to suggest specific improvements to the system. Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs). In a progress report on these Centers, Dr. Jackson described their goals as fostering the development of minority investigators trained in aging research; fostering the growth of research on minority aging; and increasing the participation of minority individuals as participants in clinical research on aging. He described early success in supporting a substantially larger than expected number of promising minority researchers in their early careers; in a large number of publications, including several in leading journals, on minority aging topics; in collaboration with the Pepper Centers that may help to increase participation in clinical research; and in planning conferences on measurement issues relevant to working with ethnically diverse groups. He also mentioned a related initiative on networks to increase the cultural diversity of the research workforce on aging. The funded grants are collaborating closely with the RCMARs to identify promising students and faculty from a broad array of colleges and universities. The efforts of both Dr. Harden and Dr. Stahl in fostering these initiatives were acknowledged. Planned review of minority aging research. Dr. Jackson reported on the results of a conference call with the group charged to review the minority aging research portfolio at NIA. The review will be conducted at the September Council meeting. Reviewers expressed an interest in gathering data on initiatives conducted prior to 1993  the proposed starting date for data collection. However, planning has focused primarily on the intellectual basis for the upcoming review. Reviewers shared the perception that the review seeks to enhance NIA's efforts in going beyond describing differences by ethnic groups to probing what it is about minority status that is scientifically important. Nevertheless, reviewers differed sharply on the extent to which they considered ethnic and minority status to be explanatory concepts, intermediate variables, or marker variables that reflect underlying differences in socioeconomic status and similar variables. Dr. Jackson identified a need to develop a working paper on this subject prior to the review. He noted that NIA and NACA are addressing what is likely to be an important issue across NIH. NIA outreach activities. Dr. Harden described a recent Technical Assistance Workshop held in conjunction with the 1998 meeting of the Gerontological Society of America and cosponsored by the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health. She also described the forthcoming Summer Institute on Aging Research, cosponsored by the Brookdale Foundation, and to be 10   held in July 1999, and a regional meeting to be held at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In planning the latter meeting, NIA worked with Dr. Carol Barnes at the University of Arizona, a former Council member, to increase outreach to local Native American communities. IX. WORKING GROUP ON PROGRAM  Dr. Gage reported on the meeting of the Working Group on Program. Eight topics were discussed. The first issue addressed was the purpose of Council review of programs, how the review is used, and whether the review should be of past performance or focus on prospective change. The nature and amount of information that is needed by Council reviewers in advance of the review was addressed, as was the need for commonality across different program reviews, and whether reviewers should make recommendations to the Institute. In discussion it was pointed out that Council reviews of programs have moved from being presentations to becoming more interactive and evaluative, in which reviewers assess entire programs or selected areas and make recommendations to the Institute. Recommendations that emerge in conjunction with one review become incorporated into the review process. For example, all programs have been asked to include reviewers who are independent of the program and/or Institute, to include at least one representative of another program so that interaction within the NIA can be addressed, and to apply a panel of objective outcome measures along with more subjective ones. Discussion followed about composition of review groups, timing of reviews, and nature and depth of discussion that the review format afforded. The sizable cost to staff of collecting data for program reviews was noted. It was pointed out that changes in the programs over time reflect both responsiveness to reviews and changes in science. Council was asked to consider whether a common guideline for program reviews would be useful or whether Council members should develop its own preferred format for each program review. The sense of Council was that indices would be helpful, particularly since Council membership changes. Since a round of program reviews will be completed at the May Council meeting, it would be useful to consider assessment criteria at the September meeting. One suggestion was that NIA consider that each program's subsequent review might address their response to the previous review's recommendations. It was recognized that when Council review of program takes place in conjunction with the Council meeting and related activities, there is time pressure that limits the extent of time to consider and prepare a thoughtful report. An effort will be made to schedule the next program review well in advance of the Council meeting so that the report on the review can be further developed. Other members pointed out that such scheduling would increase the number of meetings they would attend, and that the benefits of the increased time commitment would need to be balanced against the benefits of the separate program review and Council discussion. Dr. Hodes emphasized that how Council conducts review of programs has been an evolving process during the past 5 years, and that Institute staff would continue to work to make both the process and product informative.  11   Dr. Gage reported that the Working Group addressed issues to be brought up in the Geriatrics Program review and in the planned review of NIA's minority programs. Both items were discussed earlier in the Council meeting. Council review of special actions was discussed. This discussion ensued from the previous meeting when applications submitted on behalf of Council members were the subject of Special Actions. Concern was expressed by some members about real or apparent conflict-of-interest. Staff were asked to examine options about how other Councils handle similar circumstances. After considering several options, the Working Group recommended a change to the Statement of Understanding that is described below. Dr. Gage reported that the Working Group was informed that each Institute is required to prepare and submit a strategic plan by December 1999. The Working Group considered how best to get public input to/comment on the plan. Suggestions included public hearings in conjunction with scientific meetings, posting a draft on a website, holding special meetings at NIH, and contacting defined groups with a known commitment to aging and requesting feedback. The WGoP believed that it would be most fruitful to present a draft and solicit comment. Council members suggested that e-mail notification of interested persons, including grantees, might elicit useful comments. The Working Group discussed the fact that comment from the scientific community on science policy issues that impact on investigators often is solicited, but generally response is meagre. There have been a number of such issues lately, including support for training of investigators, proposed amendments to OMB Circular A-110 already referred to, and draft reports issued by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission. Institute staff disseminate information to Council members and ask that they enlist the expertise and assistance of their colleagues and of the societies to which they belong. Council members acknowledged the importance of participation in such matters and were encouraged to respond to such invitations as individuals. Dr. Gage summarized the WGoP's discussion about whether NIA should reconsider its decision not to participate financially in support of the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). CIDR is an infrastructure resource for high throughput genotyping that was developed to serve organizations that do not themselves have such capability. The basis for a prior recommendation of Council that NIA not participate was doubt of the need for such a facility for aging research. During discussion, Council members raised questions about the cost-benefit ratio of participating and about whether such analyses would be more cost effective to NIA grantees if NIA participated, particularly since experience has shown that Alzheimer's disease analyses are the ones most frequently conducted. Council believed additional information about relative cost would be helpful in making a recommendation. Also discussed was the extent to which CIDR is able to provide the scope of services anticipated. Council requested that Dr. Nussbaum, the NIH representative to CIDR, be invited to the May 1999 meeting of Council to make a presentation and answer questions to help guide an NIA decision. In the meantime, the CIDR Board of Governors has been asked to estimate the financial investment requested of NIA should the Institute decide to enter an  12   agreement. Dr. Hodes asked that members of Council submit questions and issues for Dr. Nussbaum to address. The WGoP approved and recommended that Council adopt the proposed amendments to the Statement of Understanding: 1. ""NIA staff may expedite award of applications within the 20th percentile that request up to $250,000 direct costs per year, provided that they raise no policy or scientific concerns. The second level of review will be either electronically or by fax before the council meets."" 2. ""If an application involving a Council member as principal investigator is identified for an individual action, in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, a group which may include former members of NACA will be appointed by the Director to provide advice or act on the application, as appropriate."" Both changes were approved. New Business: Council members voted to reopen discussion of FOIA and OMB Circular A110 to act on a comment to be forwarded to OMB. After discussion, the following statement was unanimously approved. The National Advisory Council on Aging expresses concern over the potential implications of the extension of the Freedom of Information Act under the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill in its direction to OMB to amend Circular A-110 as related to its agreement with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations. As currently drafted and undergoing review and comment from the public, the proposed revision may negatively impact the conduct of research by such institutions for a broad array of reasons. These range from concerns over privacy of individuals who voluntarily participate in clinical and other research studies, to inappropriate access to and potential misuse of all details of research at every stage of its conception, execution, and timely dissemination of results, all of which may diminish the productivity and, perversely, even serve to discourage the spirit of openness in communication and collaboration that has been a hallmark of the remarkable American biomedical and social science research enterprise. Council accepted the draft and asked that it be forwarded in their behalf. X. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS  Dr. Hadley, Associate Director of the Geriatrics Program, described recent advances in the assessment of bone structure. He indicated that the risk of fracture associated with osteoporosis is a function of both bone density and bone quality. Recent improvements in high resolution imaging combined with techniques of fractal geometry now allow bone quality to be assessed noninvasively. Much bone consists of trabeculae with space between them. A characteristic of osteoporosis is that these trabeculae become fragmented. Fractal analysis divides an area into a series of grids and counts how often a segment from one grid extends into another grid. Applied to images of bone, it is a measure of how fragmented the trabeculae are  a measure of bone quality.  13   Dr. Hadley described the work of an NIA grantee, Dr. S. Majumdar, who has applied these techniques in a case-control study of patients with hip-fractures and matched controls. Majumdar (Link et al., J Bone Miner.Res. 1998;13:1175-1182) found that the structural deficits assessed by fractal analysis of high resolution images were more highly correlated with fractures than were bone density measures. Though the study is small scale and needs to be confirmed, it offers promise of identifying individuals who are at high risk for fracture and the possibility of providing an intermediate end point (as opposed to fracture) for assessment of treatments for osteoporosis. Dr. Bellino, Acting Associate Director of the Biology of Aging Program, introduced Dr. Lee Sweeney from the University of Pennsylvania who described work conducted in collaboration with Dr. Nadia Rosenthal on loss of muscle mass and strength with increasing age (BartonDavis et al. 1998, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 95, 15603-15607). Dr. Sweeney noted that in all mammals, including humans, muscle loses mass and strength, slows down, and loses its most powerful fiber types with increasing age. His research team believes that the problem is a decline in the ability of muscle to repair itself. Muscle is continuously injured during use. It maintains satellite cells within the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Upon injury, muscle signals the proliferation of these satellite cells by releasing a variety of growth factors. The cells proliferate and repair the muscle. Dr. Sweeney further specified the source of the age-related loss as a deficit in muscle's ability to signal the satellite cells to proliferate. Using mice, Dr. Sweeney's group tested this hypothesis by using an adeno-associated virus to insert a synthetic gene into skeletal muscle. The gene allows only skeletal muscle to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), one of the growth factors secreted by muscle during repair processes. The approach also allowed the group to limit the intervention to skeletal muscle in one rear leg of mice. The other leg was used as a control. If the investigators are correct, inserting the gene should stop the muscle loss associated with increasing age. When aging mice who had had the gene inserted into skeletal muscle were examined at a very old age, the injected muscle showed mass, force, and fast muscle fibers similar to a young mouse. The non-injected leg showed characteristic age-associated losses. Before considering an intervention in humans, the research team is attempting to reproduce the result in larger animals. However, the result does offer promise of an intervention to combat loss of muscle function in the elderly. Questions concerned whether there are similar effects in young animals (there are smaller effects); clarification that the effects did not change distribution of fiber types but prevented loss of fibers; whether very old animals with apparent muscle loss have been treated (a small number, only partial recovery); whether there were changes in systemic levels of IGF-1 (no); whether there were consequent changes in vascularity in the injected animals (not scored in that way); and whether endurance tests had been given to explore the vascularity hypothesis (only in vitro testing). Dr. Morrison-Bogorad, Associate Director of the Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program, introduced Dr. Selkoe, a Council member, who spoke of new work related to the amyloid-beta (A) peptide (Wolfe et al. 1999, Nature, 398, 513-517). Dr. Selkoe 14   described the characteristic plaques and tangles in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and indicated that the plaques are composed of aggregates of 40-42 residue A peptides. Dr. Selkoe indicated that these peptides are cut out from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) following the stepwise action of a series of protease enzymes and result in a small fragment of APP, the A peptide, being released. As the accumulation of the A peptide is believed to be important in the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's disease, much work has been conducted to characterize the events leading to its release. Work to date indicates that the release is the result of a two-step process. First, a protease enzyme, known operationally as beta-secretase, cleaves APP leaving a 99 amino acid fragment that is still embedded in the membrane. Second, another enzyme, the so-called gamma-secretase, cleaves within this transmembrane segment of APP and releases the A peptide fragment. Neither of these enzymes has been identified. Dr. Selkoe then described the Presenilin-1 and 2 genes. Mutations in these genes are the most common autosomal dominant cause of early onset Alzheimer's. Although rare, the autosomal dominant form of early onset Alzheimer's is instructive regarding possible mechanisms in the much more prevalent late onset form. The presenilin genes have been wellstudied but to date their precise functions are not known. Normally the presenilin protein, a transmembrane protein, is cleaved into two fragments. In examining the amino acid chain of this protein as it winds its way through the membrane, Dr. Selkoe's group identified two aspartic acid residues in the middle of two transmembrane domains. Several lines of evidence suggested that these aspartates might be crucial for the cleavage of the presenilin protein as well as for the gamma secretase cutting of APP which releases the A peptide. To test that hypothesis, his team mutated the aspartates to alanine residues making them nonreactive. His team found that mutating either aspartate was sufficient to stop the presenilin from being cut. More importantly, the same mutation resulted in a dramatic decrease in the production of the A peptide. The group established a quantitative relationship such that as the amount of the nonreactive mutant presenilin increased, the amount of A declined. Given the hypothesized role of A in Alzheimer's disease, the result, if confirmed, is highly encouraging for identifying new ways to decrease A production. Dr. Selkoe concluded by describing his group's model of the mechanism. They believe that the two aspartates within the membrane portion of the presenilin constitute the active site of the gamma-secretase enzyme involved in the final stage of production of the A peptide. He believes that the presenilin 1 protein is the elusive gamma-secretase, or at least is essential for its function. They are now examining predictions of the model that would support their conclusions. Questions concerned what would be the strongest experimental confirmation of the model; whether naturally occurring mutations can be identified that are protective against production of  by gamma secretase; and the role of inflammation in the cascade towards Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Selkoe indicated that being able to take purified presenilin and purified APP and put them together in an environment where they can fold into the membrane should result in A production and would be the strongest test of the model. He indicated that mutations 15   protecting against production of gamma secretase might be found in populations that never develop Alzheimer's disease. He also indicated that inflammation is widely believed to result from the formation of plaques, a downstream event from the production of the A peptide. Dr. Richard Suzman, Associate Director of the Behavioral and Social Research Program, introduced Dr. David Wise, a Council member, who described cross-national research on the association between the structure of social security plans and the retirement age (Gruber and Wise, 1998; American Economic Review, 88(2), 158-163). Dr. Wise pointed out that older adults are now participating in far fewer numbers than previously in the workforce both in the U.S. and internationally. This change has occurred despite improvements in health, gains in longevity, and declines in disability. He pointed out that many national plans are structured so that the gains of income (wage earnings) in continuing to work after a certain age are offset by losses to retirement benefits. His research team calculated the replacement rate for Social Security Benefits at ages over 60 in different countries. The replacement rate is defined as the size of the retirement benefit in proportion to earnings in the last year. The replacement rate is 80 to 90 percent of wage earnings in many countries. They also calculated the change in Social Security Benefits as a proportion of wage earnings as a result of an additional year's work. They found that, in many countries, the change is negative after age 60. Social Security benefits are reduced as a result of working an extra year. Plotting the size of this ""tax"" on benefits as a function of the proportion of men aged 55 to 65 who are not working in different nations' labor forces, the group found a strong linear relationship between the probability of not working at these ages and the size of the tax on retirement benefits generated by an additional year of work. Council members, while noting the strong association and likely causality of the relationship, questioned how it is possible to determine causality when randomized trials cannot be run. Dr. Wise discussed several approaches to addressing the question. These include detailed analysis of particular patterns of retirement behavior before and after changes in retirement incentives were introduced, and a historical analysis of the reasons why the changes were introduced. Dr. Hodes thanked the presenters and called for any items of new business prior to adjournment. Dr. Harper, speaking for Council members, indicated their strong appreciation for Ms. McCann's services to Council. Dr. Hodes echoed that sentiment.  16   XI.
