AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL.    ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA      REPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES    I. CIPA DOES NOT INDUCE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO VIOLATE ANY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF THEIR PATRONS    Appellees' principal contention is that the First Amendment bars a public library from using filtering software to ensure that the library does not make pornographic visual depictions available to its patrons through its own computers on its own premises. From this premise, appellees then argue that the filtering provisions in the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) are unconstitutional on their face because they induce public libraries to commit that constitutional violation. See Multnomah County Br. 24-42; ALA Br. 17-38. Appellees' submission is profoundly wrong. The First Amendment does not bar a public library from declining to be an intermediary in the purveying of pornography to people who enter its premises. To the contrary, such a judgment concerning what material to make available to its patrons conforms to the traditional practices and role of a library. More broadly, it conforms to the traditional latitude that the Constitution affords to the government in the expenditure and the utilization of its own property and resources.    Significantly, moreover, appellees do not challenge the district court's findings that there is an enormous amount of pornography on the Internet, J.S. App. 30a-31a, that library patrons, including minors, regularly search for such material, id. at 2a, that pornography falls outside the collection boundaries of most public libraries, id. at 33a, that filtering software is a reasonably effective way to keep pornography out of the library, id. at 90a-91a, and that a significant number of public libraries acting without any encouragement from Congress have chosen to use filtering software to accomplish that purpose, id. at 3a. Instead, appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 24-29; ALA Br. 19-28) that because filtering software blocks pornography on the basis of its content, its use by a public library is subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment and may be justified only if narrowly tailored to further compelling government interests. That contention lacks merit.    A. Strict Scrutiny Does Not Apply To A Public Library's Content-Based Collection Decisions    Strict scrutiny does not apply to a public library's traditional exercise of judgment in deciding what material to collect for its patrons. Application of that standard to a library's collection practices would fundamentally alter the role of public libraries in our society, and replace librarians with judges in making day-to-day decisions respecting what material to include in or exclude from a library's offerings.    District court findings, largely ignored by appellees, demonstrate why that is so. Of crucial importance, the court found that in order to fulfill their traditional educational and informational mission, public libraries seek to collect material of ""requisite and appropriate quality,"" J.S. App. 34a, and that, as a consequence, public libraries routinely consider the ""content of the material"" in deciding whether to add it to their collections. Id. at 35a. Accordingly, if strict scrutiny were applied to traditional collection practices, public libraries could not perform their traditional role. Instead of public libraries deciding what material to include in their collections based on their assessment of its content, strict scrutiny would transfer that role to book authors, library patrons, and, ultimately, the courts. Under a strict scrutiny regime, any time a library refused to stock a book because it concluded that it did not contain content of suitable or appropriate quality, the author of the book or a library patron could challenge the decision as unconstitutional-including in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983. A court would then be required to rule in favor of the challenge unless the public library could show that its decision was narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.    No decision of this Court supports that notion. To the contrary, Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), and National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), establish that, when a government entity's mission entails the making of content-based decisions, strict scrutiny does not apply.    ALA asserts (Br. 23 & n.20) that Forbes and Finley are distinguishable because a public library will meet patron demand for lawful material through interlibrary loan. But the district court found that interlibrary loan ""is expensive"" and ""therefore used infrequently."" J.S. App. 34a. Even when cost is not an issue, the court found only that public libraries ""typically will assist patrons in obtaining access"" to lawful material, not that they always will. Ibid. And no decision of this or any other court has been located that even suggests that they have a First Amendment obligation to do so.    Moreover, the question here is whether public libraries may exercise their traditional discretion in deciding what material they will make generally available to the public in their own libraries, not the extent to which they will or must respond to particular patron requests for material that is at another library. For purposes of resolving that question, the pertinent tradition is a library's approach to assembling its permanent collection, not its interlibrary loan policies. As the district court's findings make clear, with respect to its permanent collection, a library does not seek universal coverage, but material of ""requisite and appropriate quality."" J.S. App. 34a.    2. In the end, appellees implicitly concede that a public library's traditional collection practices are not subject to strict scrutiny. Instead, they argue that a public library's decisions concerning what material to make available to its patrons are judged by a different standard when that material is posted on the Internet. However, there is no sound reason that libraries should have less freedom to decide what material to make available on their Internet-connected computers than they have to decide what books, magazines, CD ROMS, movies, microfilm, or records they will make available. At bottom, a library's Internet-connected computers are simply ""a technological extension of the book stack."" S. Rep. No. 141, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1999).    Consistent with that understanding, public libraries exercise judgment to exclude from their Internet-connected computers the same kinds of material that they categorically exclude from their physical collections, including material they view as offensive, tasteless, inappropriate, graphically violent, or pornographic. J.S. App. 37a; GXs 71, 83, 99, 247. Under appellees' theory, even though a public library's judgment to exclude such material from numerous other collections is entirely permissible, precisely the same judgment becomes constitutionally suspect when applied to a library's Internet-connected computers. Furthermore, under appellees' theory, a library's judgment not to permit access to e-mail, chat rooms, game sites, or dating services would be subject to either strict scrutiny or the heightened scrutiny that is applicable to time, place, and manner restrictions in a traditional public forum.    Appellees' approach lacks coherence. If a public library has broad discretion-as it surely does-to refuse to collect pornographic magazines, XXX videos, and other material that can be readily found at the nearest adult book store, or any of a myriad other available Internet-connected computers, it should have the same discretion to exclude that material from its computer monitors.    3. Appellees nonetheless struggle, and not without considerable irony, to distinguish a public library's Internet collection practices from its more traditional collection practices, and to impose stringent First Amendment burdens on libraries that simply do not exist in the law. None of their purported distinctions withstands analysis.    a. Multnomah County argues (Br. 39) that a public library's traditional collection practices are distinguishable because CIPA mandates filtering software for all public libraries and overrides local decisions. CIPA does not impose any such mandate. CIPA applies only to those public libraries that wish to receive Internet-related federal financial assistance and agree to accept filtering in order to do so. Those voluntary decisions by public libraries in assembling their collections are entitled to just as much deference as other collection practices. CIPA's effect is the same as if a private donor contributed funds to a library to build its collection on the condition that it not use the funds to purchase pornography. The First Amendment surely allows the library to make the choice to accept such conditional grants from public as well as private donors. Moreover, Multnomah County's purported distinction provides no support for the district court's holding that public libraries that use filtering software, even without any federal assistance, violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons.    b. Appellees also contend (Multnomah County Br. 39; ALA Br. 24) that libraries' Internet collection practices are different from their book selection practices because libraries pre-approve the books they make available, but do not pre-approve the Web sites they make available. Appellees do not explain why a library's discretion to make choices disappears when it decides what not to accept rather than what affirmatively to accept. A public library could, of course, limit its Internet collection to just those sites it pre-screened, but only at the cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that it lacks the capacity or resources to review. Faced with that choice, it is eminently reasonable for a public library to choose not to pre-screen all material, but instead to focus on the categories of material it determines to be inappropriate, wasteful, unnecessary or incompatible with its policies. Indeed, because that approach makes more information available than the alternative of offering only pre-selected sites, it is difficult to understand why either appellees or the First Amendment would favor mandatory pre- screening.    c. Appellees also err in contending (Multnomah County Br. 40-41; ALA Br. 24) that a library's Internet collection is distinguishable from its book collection because filtering software companies do the hard and resource-intensive work of choosing which particular Web sites to exclude, while librarians generally choose the books that are included. Libraries exercise significant editorial judgment in selecting both the particular software they use and the filtering categories they will enable. When a library chooses to enable the pornography category, that is comparable to a judgment not to collect pornographic books. Libraries also retain the capacity to determine whether the filter is excluding sites that the library would prefer to make available, and they can simply adjust the filters to unblock those sites. J.S. App. 52a. Thus, when library staff members determine that filtering software excludes sites that are not pornographic, they can adjust the filter to unblock those sites.    Moreover, in developing their book collections, libraries also rely on third parties. They often rely on journal reviews and bibliographies to select their books, and they sometimes delegate to third-party vendors the task of supplying books that satisfy their collection standards. J.S. App. 35a. ALA seeks to distinguish that practice on the ground that public libraries retain ultimate control over their book collections. But since libraries can add or delete sites from a blocking category, the same is true of their Internet collections.    B. A Library's Internet-Connected Computers Are Not Analogous To A Traditional Public Forum    Multnomah County contends (Br. 24-26) that strict scrutiny applies to a public library's use of filtering software to block material covered by CIPA because a library's Internet-connected computers are analogous to a traditional public forum. That contention is utterly unsustainable. Traditional public forum principles apply only to those places, such as public streets and parks, that have ""immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, * * * been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions."" International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 679 (1992). The Court has explicitly ""rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines."" Forbes, 523 U.S. at 678.    In any event, there is no coherent analogy between Internet access on a computer screen in a public library and a traditional public forum. Multnomah County argues (Br. 24) that the two are analogous because a public library is a quintessential locus for the receipt of a wide array of information. But public sidewalks and parks are not traditional public fora because they are places where a wide array of information may be received. In fact, the range of information they afford may often be quite limited. Rather, parks and sidewalks are public fora because private speakers, and not the government, have always determined the content of the speech that a person may receive there. In contrast, the amount and nature of information that may be obtained in a public library has always been determined by the public library itself, within the funding and other limitations set by the governmental body that established and supports it.    Nor is appellees' analogy assisted by Multnomah County's observation (Br. 26) that the Internet contains more information than is available in a traditional public forum. The Internet itself is not at issue here. Instead, what is at issue is the material from the Internet that a library chooses to make available on its own computers on its own premises. If a library's status as a place to obtain information and its willingness to provide a wide array of information to the public were sufficient to trigger the doctrines applicable to a traditional public forum, strict scrutiny would also apply to a public library's content-based book selections. That consequence of appellees' theory demonstrates that their analogy is fundamentally misconceived. While a public library is generally-but not always-a place where a wide array of information may be obtained, the information that may be obtained has always been whatever the library chooses to provide, and nothing more.    C. A Public Library's Internet-Connected Computers Are Not Designated Public Fora, But Even If They Were, The Library's Content-Based Collection Decisions Would Not Be Subject To Strict Scrutiny    1. Appellees are also mistaken in contending (Multnomah County Br. 27-29; ALA Br. 19-22) that a public library's Internet collection decisions are subject to strict scrutiny because libraries create a designated public forum when they furnish material from the Internet. A designated public forum is created only when the government makes an affirmative choice to open up its property for use as a public forum, Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983), not ""by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 802 (1985).    Under those principles, a public library that installs computer terminals on its premises and connects them to the Internet does not thereby create a designated public forum. The computer terminals are simply added to and subsumed in the overall resources of what is, after all, a library, and the computer terminals thus assume the essential character of the other resources the library has assembled in aid of its mission. Accordingly, a library that acquires computer terminals and connects them to the Internet cannot properly be understood as ""intentionally"" opening up its facilities, equipment, and Internet collection as a forum for ""public discourse"" by Web publishers within the meaning of this Court's cases, Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802-any more than a library's acquisition of books for its collection creates a designated public forum for ""public discourse"" by authors and publishers. Rather, the library has made its information-gathering tools available to its patrons to be used in the way that a library's collection, including other reference material, generally is used. See id. at 801-802, 805-806.    That is especially so with respect to a public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance. E-rate discounts are available only for ""educational"" purposes, 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(B), and assistance under the Library Services and Technology Act is intended ""to stimulate excellence and promote access to learning and information resources"" in libraries. 20 U.S.C. 9121(2). A public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance necessarily seeks to further those purposes, and not some broader goal of opening a public forum for public discourse by Web publishers. The library's Internet-connected computers therefore are simply information-gathering tools that, consistently with the limitations Congress has imposed, serve to supplement the library's traditional collections.    Appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 28; ALA Br. 20-21) that a public library's Internet-connected computers become designated public fora because of the breadth of information that is available on them. But if that were sufficient to create designated public fora, a public library's bookshelves would also qualify. And if that were the test, public television stations would create a designated public forum by offering diverse programming, and the National Endowment for the Arts would create a designated public forum by funding a wide array of art. As those examples demonstrate, a designated forum is not created simply because the government chooses to furnish a wide array of information-especially where, as here, it does so through its own equipment on its own premises.    2. Even if a public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance has thereby created a designated public forum, that forum would necessarily be limited to the educational and informational purposes for which it was created. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). In the context of limited public fora, the Court has drawn a distinction between content-based and viewpoint-based distinctions. Id. at 829-830. A content-based limitation is permissible if it is reasonable in light of the purposes of the designated forum. Ibid. A viewpoint-based exclusion, by contrast, is presumptively impermissible. Ibid.    The use of filtering software to block access to pornographic material covered by CIPA is content-based, not viewpoint-based. Accordingly, even if a library's Internet-connected computers were treated as a designated public forum, the use of filtering software to block access to material covered by CIPA would not be subject to strict scrutiny. Instead, the relevant question would be whether the use of filtering software is reasonable in light of the informational and educational purposes of that designated public forum. Plainly, a library could permissibly conclude that the exclusion of Internet pornography is reasonably related to those purposes, just as libraries have traditionally done respecting pornographic books.    The designated public forum cases cited by appellees are consistent with that analysis. In Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 831-832, the Court applied strict scrutiny to an exclusion from a designated public forum based on religious viewpoint. The exclusion invalidated in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269-270, (1981), was also based on religious viewpoint. Similarly, in City of Madison School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176 (1976), the Court subjected to strict scrutiny and invalidated a law that allowed ""one side of a debatable public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views to the government.""    ALA contends (Br. 26-27) that permitting the government to define the forum through the use of reasonable content-based distinctions would empty designated public forum analysis of any meaning. That concern is misguided. As Rosenberger makes clear, the government may not define a designated forum in terms of particular viewpoints, and then justify viewpoint-based distinctions as tailored to further the purposes of the forum. In addition, any content-based exclusions that are not viewpoint-based must still be justified as reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.    D. Filtering Software Is A Reasonable Means For A Library To Ensure That It Does Not Furnish Pornography To Its Patrons    1. Appellees err in contending (Multnomah County Br. 29-32; ALA Br. 29-30) that the use of filtering software is constitutionally deficient because all leading commercial filters block some constitutionally protected speech. Just as a library may choose not to purchase a book or magazine that has both pornographic and non-pornographic content, it may reasonably conclude that it is better to have an effective mechanism for blocking pornographic material than it is to abandon any such safeguard in order to guarantee that no single constitutionally protected Web site is excluded.    Appellees vastly overstate the amount of material that is erroneously excluded by filtering software. The district court estimated that tens of thousands of Web pages are erroneously blocked. J.S. App. 93a. But that represents a minute percentage of the two billion pages that are on the Internet. Id. at 30a. The district court's finding is consistent with evidence offered by appellees' own expert. Of the sites he examined, less than 1% were erroneously blocked. Id. at 79a-85a.1 A recently released study shows that a filter set to block only pornography blocks only 1.4% of all health sites. Caroline R. Richardson et al., Does Pornography-Blocking Software Block Access to Health Information on the Internet?, 288 JAMA 2887, 2891-2892 (2002).2 Other evidence in the record shows that an even smaller percentage of material sought by library patrons is actually blocked.3 Accordingly, a patron will only infrequently confront a site that is erroneously blocked. Moreover, because a standard Internet search ordinarily produces multiple sites addressing the same topic, an erroneous block will not have significance unless the person conducting the search is looking for information that can only be found on that one site.    If that happens, a patron need only ask a librarian to unblock the site. As the district court found, a library has the capacity to permanently unblock any erroneously blocked site. J.S. App. 52a. Asking a librarian to unblock a site is no different from requesting a librarian to retrieve a book that is not on the library's open stacks or to obtain a book by interlibrary loan. ALA complains (Br. 37) that CIPA permits, but does not require, a library to unblock an erroneously blocked site. That complaint is misguided. The district court found that libraries routinely respond to requests to unblock erroneously blocked sites. J.S. App. 46a. Moreover, librarians have a professional duty to assist patrons in finding information, and ALA offers no reason to believe that they will shirk that responsibility when it comes to responding to unblocking requests. In any event, the possibility that they might do so does not render CIPA itself unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied.    Multnomah County notes (Br. 35) that CIPA establishes certain limitations on disabling a filter. But those limitations apply only when a library wishes to disable the filter altogether, thereby permitting access to material that is child pornography, obscene, or harmful to minors. A library that receives Internet-related federal assistance has unrestricted freedom to unblock any site that does not fall within those categories. Appellees persistently blur the distinction between unblocking and disabling, but they are two very different ways of assisting patrons who wish to view blocked material.    Even with respect to disabling, CIPA's limitations are minimal. Under CIPA, at least with respect to adults, a filter may be disabled for any lawful purpose. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3) (disabling permitted for both adults and minors); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (disabling permitted for adults).    Appellees argue (Multnomah County Br 36-37; ALA Br. 37-38) that unblocking and disabling are inadequate because some patrons may be too embarrassed to ask for assistance from a librarian, and because a request may not be processed immediately. J.S. App. 172a. That criticism is unpersuasive. Requesting assistance is the standard way to obtain books in a closed stack, behind the reference desk, or through interlibrary loan. Similarly, a library patron seeking a book that has been checked out or a book that can be obtained only through interlibrary loan must ordinarily wait some period of time before obtaining it. There is no reason that the Constitution should require a library to adopt a different set of procedures to handle unblocking requests. But to the extent that a library may wish to take additional measures to facilitate unblocking requests, such as permitting them to be made anonymously, or expediting their processing, nothing in CIPA precludes it from doing so.4 And if libraries are unwilling to unblock particular sites, the sites are available on countless Internet-connected computers throughout the country.    2. Appellees contend (Multnomah Br. 33-34; ALA Br. 34-35) that there are less restrictive and equally effective ways to preclude library patrons from receiving access to illegal and harmful pornography on library computers. However, they conspicuously fail to defend the principal alternative identified by the district court-a tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Appellees apparently share the government's view (Gov't Br. 37-38) that such a policy is far more intrusive, restrictive, inefficient, ineffective, and burdensome on library staff than filtering software.    Multnomah County proposes (Br. 33-34) as a less restrictive alternative that a library simply announce its policy and hope that library users who agree to comply with it will do so. Evidence in the record shows that even a policy that is enforced through active monitoring is not as effective as the use of filtering software in preventing deliberate efforts to obtain pornography. J.S. App. 40a. A policy that does not involve any active monitoring, like the one Multnomah County proposes, would be even less effective. In addition, the process of securing such agreements would pose extra burdens on both library staff and patrons, and would require a library staff to bring up the subject of pornography with patrons in a way that could be offensive to the patrons and detract from their use of the library.    ALA proposes (Br. 35) as its featured alternative that a library offer optional filtering software to adults, and require young minors to obtain parental permission to use an unfiltered computer. ALA's optional filtering alternative does nothing to address a library's legitimate concern that many adults in public libraries deliberately use the library's computers to seek pornography on the Internet. ALA's parental consent proposal is equally flawed. Libraries have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their computers are not used by minors to obtain pornography, regardless of whether parents give them permission to do so.5    3. Appellees' attack on filtering software ultimately reduces to an argument that it is not a perfect solution to the problem. But even when strict scrutiny applies, perfection is not required. Here, however, strict scrutiny is not applicable. Rather, at most, a library that uses filtering software must show that it is a reasonable way to further the library's traditional educational and informational mission. Appellees' objections do not come close to showing that filtering software fails to satisfy that standard.    II. CIPA DOES NOT IMPOSE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITION ON THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE    1. Appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 45-48; ALA Br. 38- 50) that the district court's judgment may be affirmed on the alternative ground that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance. Relying on Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), they argue that CIPA's filtering conditions ""distort"" the function of public libraries (Multnomah County Br. 48) and ""suppress speech inherent"" in those libraries (ALA Br. 48). Appellees' reliance on Velazquez is wholly misplaced. In that case, the federal funding program prohibited attorneys from advocating against the government -a role that was perceived in that context to be indispensable to the proper functioning of the judicial process. The funding restriction also disfavored certain speech based on its viewpoint. Neither of those distinctive features is present here. Public libraries do not have an adversarial relationship with the government that would be compromised by accepting federal funding on the conditions established under CIPA, and those conditions do not make any distinctions based on viewpoint.    Moreover, CIPA's conditions do not in any sense distort a library's function or suppress speech inherent in that setting. Neither the collection of pornographic visual depictions nor the provision of unfiltered Internet access is inherent in the traditional role of public libraries. Libraries have never had as their goal ""universal coverage,"" J.S. App. 34a, and indeed have historically not included pornography in their collections. Thus, many libraries have found that filtering software furthers rather than distorts their traditional educational and informational mission, because it gives them the flexibility to block access to material that is outside their collection boundaries, while reserving use of their computers for legitimate research and information gathering. And because CIPA permits unblocking, libraries that wish to provide the maximum amount of lawful information are free to do so.    ALA asserts (Br. 41-42) that CIPA distorts a public library's function and suppresses speech inherent in that setting simply because it removes discretion from public libraries to decide for themselves whether to use filtering software. That assertion is inconsistent with ALA's contention elsewhere (Br. 17-38) that public libraries lack any discretion at all under the First Amendment to use filtering software. It also is without merit. To the extent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access, they are free to do so without federal assistance. If a library wishes to receive federal assistance, however, Congress has wide latitude to establish conditions that ensure that the assistance will be used for the purposes that Congress intended.    Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), is controlling on that point. In that case, the Court held that Congress has authority to insist ""that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized."" Id. at 196. ALA errs in characterizing Rust (Br. 40-41 & n.39) as a case involving government speech. The Rust Court held that Congress could impose the funding condition because ""when the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program, it is entitled to define the limits of that program."" 500 U.S. at 194. Here, Congress has defined its program as one that seeks to facilitate Internet access at libraries for educational and informational purposes, which Congress has reasonably determined should entail corresponding restrictions on using the program to make available material that is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Because the use of filtering software helps to carry out the program as so defined, it is a permissible condition under Rust.    2. Appellees alternatively contend (Multnomah County Br. 45-46; ALA Br. 43-44) that CIPA exceeds permissible limits because it applies to every computer at a library that receives assistance, even those purchased and connected without federal assistance. As an initial matter, that question does not need to be resolved in this facial challenge. If a particular library wishes to use non-federal funds to offer unfiltered access on a particular computer at the library, it may raise that issue in an as-applied challenge. In any event, CIPA's ""any computer"" condition is a permissible exercise of Congress's spending power. Under the Spending Clause, Congress is entitled to ""require[] a certain degree of separation"" from the E-rate and LSTA programs ""in order to ensure the integrity"" of those programs. Rust, 500 U.S. at 198. Permitting public libraries to offer unfiltered access at the very facilities that receive Internet-related assistance would undermine the integrity of those federal programs.    Multnomah County errs in arguing (Br. 45-46) that CIPA's ""any computer"" condition conflicts with this Court's decision in FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984). In that case, the Court invalidated a funding restriction on editorializing because it prohibited recipients from editorializing through a separate affiliate. Ibid. CIPA does not suffer from that vice. A recipient that wishes to offer unfiltered access outside the scope of the federal program may do so through an affiliated library that does not receive federal Internet-related assistance.    ALA is mistaken in claiming (Br. 44) that CIPA does not afford that option. Under its express terms, CIPA's conditions attach only to the computers of the particular libraries that receive Internet-related assistance. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) and (B); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) and (C). An affiliated library receiving no federal assistance is therefore not covered. That is the way the federal enforcement agencies interpret CIPA, and that interpretation is consistent with both CIPA's text, and the principle that statutes should be interpreted to avoid constitutional questions, not to create them.    3. While the foregoing is sufficient to show that CIPA is not invalid on its face as imposing an unconstitutional condition, there is also a substantial question whether appellees may assert an unconstitutional conditions claim at all. The courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that government entities are not protected by the First Amendment. Gov't Br. 40-41. Moreover, while appellees wish to assert the rights of their patrons, this Court has never held that an unconstitutional conditions claim may be asserted on behalf of persons upon whom no conditions have been imposed. See id. at 41-42. All of the cases cited by appellees for that proposition (Multnomah County Br. 46; ALA Br. 45-46) involved one or more recipients upon whom an allegedly unconstitutional condition had been imposed, so the Court had no occasion to resolve the question.6    ALA contends (Br. 48-49) that if municipalities have no First Amendment rights, there is no limit on the speech restrictions that Congress could impose on municipalities directly or though funding conditions. That contention is incorrect. The Tenth Amendment would place some limits on direct restrictions, and the Spending Clause requires that any speech-related or other conditions must be related to the purposes for which the assistance is provided. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).7    * * * * *    The judgment of the district court should be reversed.    Respectfully submitted.    THEODORE B. OLSON  Solicitor General      FEBRUARY 2003    1 Appellees disavow (Multnomah County Br. 30 n.2; ALA Br. 32 n.31) the significance of their expert's testimony, but the district court relied on that testimony, J.S. App. 84a-85a, and appellees have not shown that reliance to be clearly erroneous. There is no reason to believe that the estimate based on the testimony of appellees' expert significantly understates the percentage of erroneous blocks. Indeed, appellees' expert skewed his results in two ways that would tend to overestimate the percentage of sites erroneously blocked. First, his sample consisted of sites that were more likely to be erroneously blocked. Id. at 85a. Second, he counted a site as erroneously blocked if any one of the software programs erroneously blocked it. Id. at 79a.    2 ALA notes (Br. 32-33 n.31) that the same study shows that a filter set to block pornography blocks 10% of the sites using the search terms safe sex, condom, and gay. 288 JAMA at 2891. That still leaves 90% of those sites accessible. A library collection that contained 90% of all books on a particular topic would be extraordinarily inclusive, not constitutionally suspect. The same is true for Web sites.    3 Biek Test. 76 (Tacoma filter intercepts occur in .5%-.6% of the attempts to load a URL); Joint Exh. 6 (McBride Dep.), at 47 (at Greenville County Library System, the ratio of blocked sites to sites requested is approximately .005%).    4 Because of the distinctive features of public libraries, appellees err in relying on decisions in which the Court has condemned schemes that required persons to seek permission to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment. Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (permission to receive certain mailings); Denver Area Educ. Telecom. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727 (1996) (request to receive sexually explicit programming); Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002) (permission to conduct door-to-door canvassing). The routine practice of seeking assistance from a professional librarian in obtaining material from the library's own collection is nothing like the schemes at issue in those cases.    5 The other alternatives suggested by appellees-privacy screens, recessed monitors, training on Internet use, placing computers in areas of high traffic either do not address a library's interest in preventing its computers from being used by persons who seek out material covered by CIPA, or are substantially less effective than filtering software. See Gov't Br. 38-39. Those alternatives also are not as effective in preventing inadvertent exposure to material covered by CIPA. Id. at 39.    6 The Court's decision in First National Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), does not assist appellees. The Court's holding that a private corporation may assert that restrictions on its speech violate the First Amendment does not imply that a public entity may.    7 Multnomah County errs in arguing (Br. 42-45) that a public library's use of filtering software constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on speech. A library's use of filtering software is no more a prior restraint on speech than is its refusal to provide patrons with pornographic magazines. Both are collection decisions that affect only what material may be obtained from the library, not from private sources. Multnomah County sees a difference where the use of filtering software results from CIPA, rather than a local library's own decision. But where CIPA applies, local libraries have voluntarily agreed to install filtering software as a condition of receiving federal Internet-related assistance. The installation of such software therefore does result from local library decisions. In any event, prior restraint doctrine does not depend on whether an action is locally or federally inspired, but on whether the action is a prior restraint on speech. CIPA imposes no such restraint."
GX252-99-4671046	"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  ARIF DURRANI, Petitioner, v. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Respondent.  : : : : : : :  CRIMINAL NO. 3:86CR59 (SRU)  RULING In 1987, Petitioner Arif Durrani (""Durrani"") was convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C.  2778, and the accompanying International Traffic In Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R.  120 et seq., and was sentenced to a term of incarceration. Having fully served his sentence and been released from custody, Durrani brought the current petition for a writ of coram nobis or audita querela, seeking an order vacating his conviction. Alternatively, Durrani requests additional discovery to support his claim that he was shipping arms to Iran on behalf of the United States government. This is Durrani's fourth post-conviction attack on his sentence. The government moves to dismiss the petition, arguing that the claims are procedurally barred, untimely and meritless. On July 25, 2003, the court heard oral argument on the current petition. For the reasons that follow, Durrani's motion to vacate his sentence and/or to seek additional discovery is denied. I. Background Because the background to this case was thoroughly developed in the Second Circuit's decision affirming Durrani's conviction, Durrani v. United States, 835 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1987), the court will discuss only the facts relevant to the current petition.   On October 8, 1986,1 Durrani was charged with exporting arms without a State Department license.2 Shortly thereafter, allegations began to surface that high-ranking United States government officials were involved in what came to be known as the Iran-Contra affair, a covert operation in which the United States government was selling arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages. Before trial on the criminal charges against him, Durrani moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the government was selectively prosecuting violators of the licensing provision. In his motion to dismiss, Durrani did not allege that the government had requested his assistance in locating military parts. Rather, only after the release of the Senate Intelligence report on the Iran-Contra Affair, in January 1987, did Durrani raise for the first time that he was working in concert with the government.  At trial, Durrani argued that his actions derived from officially-sanctioned covert operations, and he was therefore exempt from any licensing requirements. Durrani claimed that he was working at the request of Manuel Pires (""Pires""), an international arms dealer, whom Durrani claimed was working for Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the United States National Security Counsel (""NSC""). Durrani On February 18, 1986, the government filed a superseding indictment to include charges of attempting to export arms without a State Department license and failing to register as an arms exporter with the State Department Office of Munitions Control. ""The Arms Export Control Act establishes the basic requirements for the sale and export of American-made military equipment and ammunition to foreign purchasers. Before a private exporter may sell any article contained on the [U.S. Munitions List] he must apply for an export license from the U.S. State Department's Office of Munitions Control. The exporter must include in the application a description of the arms, their ultimate destination, and their intended use. The Munitions Control Office then decides whether to grant the license based upon the information contained in the application. If an export license is granted, the exporter must present it to the Customs Service at the time of export."" Kuhali v. Reno, 266 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Schwartz, 924 F.2d 410, 416 (2d Cir. 1991)). 2 2 1   argued that Pires, at the insistence of Colonel North, requested Durrani to locate missile parts to ship to Iran. The prosecution argued that Colonel North would not have requested Durrani, either directly or indirectly, to locate military parts for the United States government because the Central Intelligence Agency (""CIA""), not private parties, was in charge of obtaining all military parts for Colonel North. In addition, Charles Moyer of the CIA claimed the CIA had no record of an association with Pires or Durrani. On April 2, 1987, a jury found Durrani guilty on all three charges. On December 3, 1987, the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction. United States v. Durrani, 835 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1987). On July 15, 1988, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as it was in effect at the time of the offense in this case, Durrani filed a motion for reduction of sentence. Durrani argued that ""important new information regarding the role of private individuals in the Iran arms deals strongly suggests that the court may have been unduly and unnecessarily harsh in its assessment."" Recognizing that a Rule 35(b) motion is ""essentially a plea for leniency,"" the District Court (Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly) held that neither the submission by the parties nor the rest of the record suggests that Durrani should be entitled to any grant of leniency. ""Quite the contrary, the record reveals that [the] defendant on several occasions has committed or has caused to be committed falsehoods in the pretrial, trial and post-trial proceedings in this matter, reflecting a complete disdain for the law and this Court."" Accordingly, on May 23, 1989, Judge Daly denied Durrani's Rule 35(b) motion. On March 4, 1990, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255, Durrani filed a pro se habeas corpus petition to vacate his conviction. On August 6, 1991, Durrani, with the assistance of counsel, filed an amended section 2255 petition, alleging that the government had withheld various forms of exculpatory material. Particularly relevant for purposes of this motion, Durrani alleged that agents or employees of 3   the United States government knew at the time of Durrani's trial that the United States government, either directly or indirectly, involved private individuals, including Pires, in the procurement of military weapons for shipment to Iran. Judge Daly permitted Durrani time to accumulate evidence to support his section 2255 petition. In its attempt to comply with Durrani's document production requests, the government asked the Office of Independent Counsel (""OIC"") to search its files for documents relevant to Durrani's request. On October 2, 1991, after an in camera review, Judge Daly ordered some of the OIC-produced documents to be disclosed to Durrani. Despite repeated discovery deadline extensions, Durrani was unable to gather sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was working in concert with the United States government. Accordingly, on May 21, 1992, Durrani moved for voluntary dismissal of his section 2255 petition claiming that he wanted to resolve his pending Immigration and Naturalization Services (""INS"") proceedings prior to focusing on his section 2255 petition. After a hearing at which Durrani was present, Judge Daly granted the motion, ruling: ""On consent of the government, counsel for the petitioner, and the petitioner himself and consistent with the Court's ruling in open court on this same date, the motion is hereby ORDERED dismissed without prejudice to renewal upon a filing, on or before, December 31, 1992, made in compliance with the appropriate rules F.R.C.P. 41(a)(2). If no renewed motion is filed on or by that date, this dismissal will be with prejudice."" On December 28, 1992, three days before the filing deadline, Durrani requested a 30-day extension of time, suggesting that the INS proceeding had prevented him from paying due attention to the section 2255 proceeding. The court denied Durrani's request holding that, ""[a]s this matter has been continued innumerable times and as the reason for requesting this extension is that the movant 4   himself has not given adequate attention to this matter, the motion is DENIED in the interest of finality, and the petition hereby ordered dismissed with prejudice."" Durrani did not appeal the court's denial of the motion. Durrani was released from prison in September 1992. In 1995, the INS declared Durrani deportable. Durrani challenged this determination and sought political asylum. According to Durrani, his efforts were denied in October 1997 because the INS deemed Durrani an aggravated felon pursuant to the 1996 Amendments to the immigration laws.3 Durrani then voluntarily left the United States in January 1998. Durrani claims he spent the next three years attempting to gain a visa to reenter the United States and that it was not until recently (at some point in 2001) that he realized the INS would not grant him a visa. On January 14, 2002, ten years after he was released from prison and fifteen years after he was convicted, Durrani filed the current petition seeking to vacate his sentence. Durrani argues that the court should grant the petition because prior to trial, and during the section 2255 proceedings, the government failed to disclose potentially exculpatory/impeachment evidence that could have corroborated his claim that he was working on behalf of Pires and Colonel North. Durrani submits that, if the undisclosed documents had been turned over, he would have potentially been able to link  In 1992, when Durrani was found guilty, his conviction was not classified as an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(43) (1994); Echendu, 2003 WL 21653370 *4. As such, he was not subject to deportation under the immigration laws in force at the time. Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (""IIRIRA""), however, Durrani's conviction is now classified as an aggravated felony, making Durrani deportable. See id; see also United States v. Luna-Reynoso, 258 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir. 2001) (upholding the application of the redefinition of aggravated felony to convictions prior to IIRIRA). 5  3   Pires to the CIA, thereby impeaching Moyer's testimony that the CIA did not use private individuals to gather military parts and that the CIA did not have any records of Pires. Alternatively, Durrani requests the court to grant him additional discovery to support his claim that he was working in concert with the United States government. Durrani believes that if his conviction is vacated he will be able to obtain a visa to re-enter the United States. The government moves to dismiss the petition, arguing that his claims are procedurally barred because he previously litigated the current claims in his prior habeas corpus petition that was denied with prejudice. In addition, the government argues that Durrani's claims are untimely. Alternatively, the government argues that the petition should be denied on the merits because Durrani has presented no evidence that the government withheld potentially exculpatory/ impeachment evidence. The government then argues that Durrani should not be permitted additional discovery -fifteen-years after he was convicted, ten years after the habeas corpus deadline passed and seven years after he was deported -- to support an otherwise meritless claim. II. DISCUSSION A. Propriety of Collateral Attack. Prior to reaching the merits of the coram nobis petition, the court must determine whether, in light of Durrani's prior habeas corpus petition, which raises grounds identical to those in the current petition, the petition is properly before the court. Polizzi v. United States, 550 F.2d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 1976) (""Although principles of res judicata do not bar a prisoner from re-litigating on ... coram nobis issues raised in the original appeal, a district court may refuse to entertain a repetitive petition ... previously determined on the merits."") (internal quotations omitted) (citing Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 227 (1969)); see also Chin v. United States, 622 F.2d 1090, 1092 (2d Cir. 1980) 6   (recognizing that, absent special circumstances, once a matter has been decided adversely to a defendant on direct appeal it cannot be relitigated in a coram nobis petition); Willis v. United States, 654 F.2d 23 (8th Cir. 1981) (""[C]oram nobis may not be used to relitigate matters raised in a  2255 motion.""); Klein v. United States, 880 F.2d 250, 254 n.1 (10th Cir. 1989) ( ""[C]oram nobis relief is not available to litigate issues already litigated; it is reserved for claims which have yet to receive their first disposition."") (citing United States v. Keane , 852 F.2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1988)). It is appropriate to use the same analytical framework when ruling on the propriety of current coram nobis petition as when analyzing successive habeas corpus petitions. See Fleming v. United States, 146 F.3d 88, 90 (2d Cir. 1998) (recognizing that ""because of the similarities between coram nobis proceedings and  2255 proceedings, the  2255 procedure often is applied by analogy in coram nobis cases"") (quoting Blanton v. United States, 94 F.3d 227, 235 (6th Cir. 1996)). Accordingly, the court will refuse to entertain a coram nobis petition if: (1) the same grounds presented in the current petition were determined adversely to petitioner in an earlier collateral proceeding; (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ""ends of justice"" would not be served by reaching the merits of the repetitive grounds in the current petition. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15 (1963) (setting the standard for determining the propriety of successive habeas corpus petitions); United States ex rel. Schnitzler v. Follette, 406 F.2d 319, 322 (2d Cir. 1969) (reversing a district court's decision to entertain a habeas corpus application when the application was factually and legally identical to one previously rejected on the merits by the Second Circuit). After applying the three-part test, it is clear that the court should not entertain the merits of Durrani's coram nobis petition. First, the grounds presented in the section 2255 petition are the same 7   grounds presented in the current petition. In his section 2255 petition, Durrani requested the court to vacate his sentence because, in part, the government failed to disclose evidence that the ""United States government knew at the time of trial that private people, directly or indirectly, including Manuel Pires, among others, were involved in the procurement of weapons, ... at the behest of the United States government or its agents and with their discretion and encouragement, as part of an effort to free American Hostages in Iran ...."" In the current petition, Durrani claims that the government failed to disclose exculpatory or potentially exculpatory evidence, either at the time of trial and/or during the course of the section 2255 proceedings, that would have linked Pires to the United States government's effort to export arms to Iran. Durrani argues that evidence demonstrating that the government was using Pires, a private party, to locate military spare parts, would have supported his claim that he was working with Pires to secure arms for the United States to ship to Iran. Accordingly, Durrani presents the same grounds for relief in the current petition as he previously raised in his section 2255 petition. Fleming v. United States, 1993 WL 37304 at 2 (a ground for relief is simply a sufficient legal basis for granting the relief sought, and identical grounds may often be proved by different factual allegations) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Sanders, 373 U.S. at 15). In addition, it is clear that the habeas corpus petition was determined adversely to Durrani because it was dismissed with prejudice. Second, ""[a] dismissal with prejudice is a `final judgment' on the merits which will bar a second suit between same parties for same cause of action."" Cleveland v. Higgins, 148 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1945) (recognizing that for res judicata purposes ""a dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits which will bar a second suit between the same parties for the same cause of action.""); Pfotzer v. Amercoat Corp., 548 F.2d 51, 52 (2d Cir. 1977); Phillips v. Shannon, 445 F.2d 460 (7th Cir. 1971) 8   (recognizing that the overwhelming weight of authority holds that a dismissal with prejudice constitutes a disposition on the merits). Third, Durrani argues that, the ""ends of justice"" would be served by the court reaching the merits of the current petition. The Second Circuit has interpreted ""the ends of justice"" ""to include situations in which the relevant facts had not been adequately developed on petitioner's first application, and instances where a change in the law had occurred since the previous determination against him."" Schnitzler, 406 F.2d at 321 (interpreting Sanders, 373 U.S. at 16-17); United States v. Bradford, 178 F. Supp. 709, 711 (D.C.N.Y. 1959). Neither of those situations applies here. Durrani submits, in principal part, an internal OIC memorandum (hereinafter referred to as ""Exhibit 8"")4 as evidence in support of his claim that the government was untruthful about its association with Pires and that the government withheld potentially exculpatory or impeachment evidence. Exhibit 8 does not indicate that either Durrani or Pires worked on behalf of the United States government or one of its agencies. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that, in 1988, the CIA possessed a document that  4  Exhibit 8 reads as follows:  TO: Bob Scwartz FROM: Randy Bellows DATE: January 11, 1988 RE: Durrani The CIA showed me a document yesterday concerning IGAM (International Gray Arms Market). In it were references to one or more of the individuals listed in paragraphs [sic] 5 of my Durrani Brady list. (The names are Pires, Dost, Zadeh.) I've requested this document from the CIA and asked Rick Page to draw it to your attention when it comes in. This is a document we may want to turn over to the USAO (although we'll probably need CIA's ""Third Agency"" permission to do so.) cc: Rick Page 9   connected Pires to the international gray arms market. Even assuming that the CIA had evidence of such a connection, that connection does not lend support to Durrani's claim that he worked directly or indirectly for the United States government.5 Moreover, the ends of justice would  not be served by reaching the merits of the current petition. Durrani was given until December 31, 1992, to gather evidence to support his section 2255 petition. On December 28, 1992, Durrani requested a 30-day extension to support his claim. The request was denied. If Durrani believed that the court erroneously denied the deadline extension, he should have appealed. Instead, Durrani asks the court to take up what amount to a successive section 2255 petition some ten years later after the deadline passed. In sum, the petitioner has made no showing warranting reconsideration of his claim. Durrani's claim that he was excused from the licensing provisions or that he received an inequitable sentence in light of his work on behalf of the United States government was developed at trial, on appeal, in the Rule 35 motion and in the section 2255 proceeding. This is Durrani's fourth post-conviction attempt to litigate the same issue that has previously and repeatedly been decided against him. In the current  Durrani also submitted an affidavit of Pires (""Exhibit 6""). The affidavit is unsworn. In addition, Pires does not claim in the affidavit to have been working for the United States government or any agency of the government. Rather, Pires states that he was working with the government of Iran to purchase military equipment from Israel and from Israeli companies. At oral argument, Durrani's counsel admitted that the affidavit ""does not say in any shape or form that [Durrani] was operating with the United States Government."" Tr. 07/25/03 at 17. Durrani also submitted correspondence between the United States Attorney's Office and the OIC relating to potential communications between Durrani and Pires. See Durrani's Exhibits 15 and 16. Durrani contends that, because the correspondence indicates that each side would search for files or records relevant to Durrani's defense, such records or files actually existed. Consistent with his argument regarding Exhibit 8, without knowledge that any relevant documents exist, Durrani requests the court to speculate that the government possesses evidence in support of his claims. 10  5   petition, Durrani provides no new credible evidence supporting his connection to the United States government. Accordingly, in the absence of credible new evidence or a change of law, Durrani is not entitled to another review of that issue. See Schnitzler, 406 F.2d at 321; United States v. Stimac, 684 F. Supp. 545, 547 (""even if [Stimac] could move under coram nobis, the writ presently before the court raises the same Brady claim that this Court determined petitioner Stimac procedurally defaulted on in his previous  2255 motions""). Durrani's present petition is procedurally barred. Nevertheless, because it is always possible that the appellate court may disagree, this decision will consider the merits of the coram nobis petition. B. Coram Nobis  Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651(a), a district court is authorized to grant the common law writ of error coram nobis. 28 U.S.C.  1651(a) (""The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions agreeable to the usages and principles of law.""); United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 511 (1954) (holding that the enactment of 28 U.S.C.  2255 did not supersede the availability of writ of coram nobis). The writ is available as a ""remedy of last resort for petitioners who are no longer in custody pursuant to a criminal conviction and therefore cannot pursue direct review or collateral relief by means of a writ of habeas corpus."" Fleming v. United States, 146 F.3d 88, 89-90 (2d Cir. 1998). The court is authorized to grant the writ, however, only ""under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice."" Morgan, 346 U.S. at 511; Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) (stating that ""it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [a writ of coram nobis ] would be necessary or appropriate."" (bracketed material in original) (quoting United 11   States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947)); United States v. LaPlante, 57 F.3d 252, 253 (2d Cir. 1995) (""Though formally abolished in civil cases, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), the writs of error coram nobis and audita querela remain available in very limited circumstances with respect to criminal convictions.""). The writ is issued ""to correct errors of fact unknown to the court at the time of the judgment, without fault of the defendant, which, if known, would probably have prevented the judgment."" Morgan, 346 U.S. at 516. In evaluating a coram nobis claim, the proceedings leading to the petitioner's conviction are presumed to be correct, and the burden rests on the petitioner to demonstrate that: (1) sound reasons exist for his failure to seek appropriate relief earlier; (2) he continues to suffer legal consequences from his conviction that may be remedied by granting of the writ; and (3) granting such relief is necessary under the circumstances to achieve justice. Foont v. United States, 93 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 1996); Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512. 1. Sound Reasons for Delay The first issue is whether petitioner's delay in seeking relief renders coram nobis relief unavailable. Foont , 93 F.3d at 79. More specifically, the petitioner has the burden to provide sound reasons why he failed to secure prior collateral relief, see Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512; Foont , 93 F.3d at 79, which includes why he failed to seek prior coram nobis relief. See Echendu v. United States, 2003 WL 21653370 *7 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding that petitioner had not offered a sound reason for the delay in seeking earlier collateral relief and in seeking earlier coram nobis relief). In addition, the ""availability"" of prior relief is determined by whether or not petitioner could attempt to secure such relief; it is irrelevant whether or not the petitioner would actually be successful in securing it. United 12   States v. Farley, 971 F. Supp. 184 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (clarifying that the fact that a petitioner is unable to secure  2255 relief does not mean that such relief in ""unavailable"" for purposes of coram nobis analysis), citing Bennett v. United States, 1997 WL 285987 (N.D. Il. 1997); Collins v. United States, 2000 WL 516892 * 6 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (dismissing Collins' petition for coram nobis because ""Collins [could] not argue that his claim is one that could not have been addressed in any other post-conviction proceeding.""). Durrani has not offered any justification why he failed to seek available collateral relief earlier. He cannot argue that his claim is one that could not have been addressed in any other prior postconviction proceeding because Durrani, in fact, raised the same claim in a prior post-conviction proceeding, namely the section 2255 proceeding. In the current petition, as well as in the section 2255 petition, Durrani argued that the government withheld information that would have supported Durrani's claim that private individuals, including Manuel Pires, secured military parts on behalf of the United States government for shipment to Iran. Accordingly, Durrani is precluded from raising the same claim in the current proceedings because prior post-conviction relief was available. The fact that Durrani was unable to comply with the section 2255 deadline does not mean that prior section 2255 relief was not available, it only means that Durrani was unable to secure it. See Farley, 971 F. Supp. at 186. In addition, Durrani has failed to adequately explain why he did not seek coram nobis relief earlier. Durrani claims that, in order to conserve limited personal and judicial resources, he attempted to resolve his immigration proceedings prior to seeking coram nobis relief. Durrani admits that ""[a]lthough it is true that [the] INS efforts also served as the basis for his delays ten years ago, rather than burden the Court with proceedings that could have become moot through a simple administrative 13   decision, [he] instead chose to wait until it was clear no relief was forthcoming."" Durrani Reply Memo. Doc. # 13, at 4; see also Tr. 07/25/03, at 4. This argument fails for several reasons. First, Durrani's concern not to burden the court by filing a proceeding does not excuse Durrani from waiting ten years since he was released from prison to file the current petition. In general, there is nothing inconsistent with a criminal defendant pursing both immigration and judicial remedies simultaneously. Although, in certain circumstances, the pendency of immigration proceedings can justify a short delay in filing a coram nobis petition, such circumstances do not exist in this case. For example, in Tocci v. United States, 178 F. Supp. 2d 176, 181 (N.D.N.Y. 2001), the petitioner filed his habeas corpus petition four months late, yet the court construed the tardy habeas petition as a coram nobis petition. The court excused the four-month delay ""given the absence of counsel and of any advice to Tocci of his right to appeal, given the commencement and continued pendency of the removal proceeding, given the absence of any other direct or collateral reviews of Tocci's claims, and given the [brief four-month] period of delay."" Id. at 182. In the present case, Durrani missed the habeas deadline by ten years and was represented on direct appeal, during the section 2255 proceedings, and on his Rule 35 motion. Whereas Tocci had not availed himself of other avenues of direct or collateral review, the current motion is Durrani's fourth attempt at post-conviction relief. Second, Durrani erroneously believes that, in analyzing the sufficiency of the sound reason for delay in filing the coram nobis petition, the court should measure the period of delay from the completion of the immigration proceedings until the filing of the coram nobis petition. To the court's knowledge, however, no other court has used the date on which immigration proceedings are 14   completed as the appropriate commencement point for analyzing a petitioner's delay in filing a coram nobis petition. In United States v. Ko, 1999 WL 1216730, *4 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), the court noted that the appropriate time period in which to analyze a petitioner's delay in filing a coram nobis petition commences with the date of the deportation order. Under that standard, and in light of Durrani's claim that the INS classified him as deportable in 1995,6 Durrani waited approximately seven years to file the current petition. Alternatively, the court in Echendu v. United States, 2003 WL 21653370 *5 (E.D.N.Y. 2003), held that petitioner's delay in filing a corum nobis petition seeking relief from deportation proceedings ""is properly calculated with reference to the period between the day the IIRIRA was enacted [September 30, 1996] and the day the petition was filed ...."" Under this time frame, Durrani waited approximately six years. Regardless of which measure the court uses, Durrani has not provided a sufficient excuse for the tremendous delay in filing his petition. See Tocci, 178 F. Supp. 2d at 181 (""[T]he sufficiency of the reasons bears an inverse relationship to the length of the delay -- the longer the delay, the more compelling must be the reasons.""). Typically, ""[i]n the absence of a sound reasons provided by the petitioner, the courts have generally found that a belated petition for coram nobis should be dismissed if its filing has been delayed for more than several years."" Echendu, 2003 WL 21653370 *6 (petitioner barred by unjustified seven-year delay); Foont , 93 F.3d at 80 (petitioner barred by unjustified fouryear-and-eight-month delay); Mastrogiacomo v. United States, 2001 WL 799741, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2001) (petitioner barred by unjustified three-year delay); cf. Nicks v. United States, 835 F.  Even if the INS erroneously classified him as deportable in 1995, as Durrani claims, Durrani was still on notice in 1995 that the INS was going to deport him. 15  6   Supp. 151, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (petitioner justified a fifteen-year delay because ""[a]t no time revealed by the post-sentencing record was Nicks in a condition to evaluate the need for and prospects of coram nobis relief, or to instruct his attorneys in that regard.""). The court does not accept Durrani's concern for conserving personal and judicial resources as a legitimate reason to delay the filing of a coram nobis petition because there is nothing inconsistent with pursuing immigration and judicial remedies simultaneously. Moreover, as compared to Tocci, there are no special circumstances excusing the delay. This is Durrani's fourth attempt at post-conviction relief and he was provided with able counsel throughout his judicial proceedings. Accordingly, because Durrani has not provided a sufficient justification for his failure to seek earlier available collateral relief and earlier coram nobis relief, the court need not consider the other elements of the coram nobis petition. In an exercise of caution, however, the court will examine whether Durrani has satisfied the third prong of the coram nobis evaluation. 7  The court recognizes that a petitioner's inability to re-enter the United States as a collateral consequence to a criminal conviction is a sufficient legal consequence for coram nobis relief. See Tapia Garcia v. INS., 237 F. 3d 1216, 1218 (10th Cir. 2001) (alien's ""inability to reenter and reside legally in the United States with his family is a collateral consequence of his deportation because it is clearly a concrete disadvantage imposed as a matter of law""); Steel v. Blackman, 236 F.3d 130, 135 n.4 (3d Cir. 2001) (""Erroneous conviction of an aggravated felony will have several continuing and serious legal consequences for [alien], including serving as a permanent bar preventing his return to the United States to visit his family.""); Ko, WL 1216730, at *4 (holding that deportation proceedings sufficient to demonstrate adverse legal consequences); Polanco v. United States, 803 F. Supp. 928 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (same). The government argues that, even if the court vacates Durrani's conviction, Durrani is still not eligible for re-entry into the United States pursuant to the IIRIRA given the nature of the conduct underlying his conviction. Because Durrain clearly fails to demonstrate the other elements of coram nobis, it is unnecessary to determine which party has the correct interpretation of the effect of the IIRIRA. 16  7   2. Compelling Circumstances To demonstrate compelling circumstances, a petitioner must show a defect in the proceedings that resulted in a ""complete miscarriage of justice."" Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346 (1974). Durrani's ""compelling circumstances"" argument in support of his petition for a writ of coram nobis is premised upon an alleged denial of his constitutional right to a fair trial -- on the ground that the prosecutors withheld exculpatory or potentially exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). According to Brady, ""[t]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution."" Id. at 87; United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2001). ""Favorable evidence includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness."" Coppa, 267 F.3d at 139 (citing Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)). ""Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). Durrani argues that the government violated Brady, in principal part, by failing to disclose the unidentified document referenced in Exhibit 8. See Tr. 07/25/03, at 13 (""without a doubt, the primary reliance for at least the existence of [potentially exculpatory see id. at 7] is Exhibit 8""). It is not disputed that Exhibit 8, on its face, does not constitute exculpatory material because neither Exhibit 8 itself, nor the document referenced in Exhibit 8, indicates that Durrani worked directly 17   or indirectly on behalf of the United States. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that the CIA possessed a document that potentially linked Pires to the international gray arms market. Even assuming that to be the case, the document would not constitute exculpatory evidence within the meaning of Brady. In addition, Exhibit 8 cannot be reasonably interpreted as impeachment evidence. At trial, Charles Moyer of the CIA testified that the CIA had ""no record of an association with Manuel Pires."" Def. Ex. 4 at 134, 139. Exhibit 8 indicates nothing contradictory to that testimony. Whether or not Pires was linked to the international gray arms market is irrelevant to whether the CIA was associated with Pires. In his affidavit, Pires himself claims to have been working on behalf of Iran. See Def. Ex. # 6. Moreover, Moyer testified that the ""if Mr. Pires had been employed by or associated with the Central Intelligence Agency"" that his records would have reflected that. Id. at 139. Durrani has presented no credible evidence undermining Mr. Moyer's testimony. Durrani argues that if, the unidentified document referred to in Exhibit 8 was disclosed, the document could constitute Brady material or the document could lead to the production of other documents that could be considered Brady material. As such, Durrani is arguing that the government violated Brady by failing to disclose potentially exculpatory and/or impeachment evidence. As such, Durrani's motions falls short of Brady's materiality requirement. Carter v. Rafferty, 621 F. Supp. 533, 549 fn.1 (D. N.J. 1985) (""There must be a real possibility that the evidence would have affected the result.""); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110 (1976) (""the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial does not establish, materiality in the constitutional sense.""); United States v. Williams, 792 F. Supp. 1120, 1229 (S.D. Ind. 1992) (... ""the rule of Brady is not a rule of discovery, but a doctrine of 18   constitutional error to be raised when specific evidence is withheld which deprives the Defendant of a fair trial.""). Durrani has failed to demonstrate that there is a real possibility that the government withheld Brady material. First, Exhibit 8 does not indicate that the government possessed the undisclosed document referenced in Exhibit 8 either at the time of Durrani's trial, appeal or during the section 2255 proceeding. Second, Exhibit 8 does not indicate that the undisclosed document referenced in Exhibit 8 is favorable to Durrani. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that the unidentified document connects Pires to the international gray arms market. There is no indication that the unidentified document would reveal that either Durrani or Pires worked on behalf of the United States government.8 Third, Durrani simply hasn't demonstrated that there is a ""real possibility"" that the undisclosed document could potentially constitute Brady material. As such, Durrani's lack of evidence suggesting a real possibility the government violated Brady precludes the court from finding compelling circumstances warranting that court to grant the coram nobis petition. C. Writ of Audita Querela Writs of audita querela and coram nobis ""are similar, but not identical."" United States v. Reyes, 945 F.2d 862, 863 n.1 (5th Cir. 1991). Usually, a writ of coram nobis is used ""to attack a judgment that was infirm [at the time it issued], for reasons that later came to light."" Id. By contrast, a writ of  The same reasoning applies to Exhibits 15 and 16, which Durrani submits in support of his petition. Those exhibits are letters of communication between the OIC and the United States Attorney's Office regarding efforts to comply with the Government's Brady obligations. The letters do not indicate that the government, in fact, had Brady material. Again, Durrani's argument relies on pure speculation as to whether Brady material exists. 19  8   audita querela is used to challenge ""a judgment that was correct at the time rendered but which is rendered infirm by matters which arise after its rendition."" Id. It is meant ""only to allow a defendant to present a defense not discovered until after judgment was rendered."" Id.; see LaPlante, 57 F.3d at 252 (""Audita querela is probably available where there is a legal, as contrasted with an equitable, objection to a conviction that has arisen subsequent to the conviction ....""); United States v. Tablie, 166 F.3d 505, 507 (2d Cir. 1999) (recognizing the necessity of a legal defect in the conviction in order to obtain relief). In addition, audita querela is not available when the relief sought is available through another post-conviction remedy. Tablie, 166 F.3d at 507 (citing United States v. Holder, 936 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991)); United States v. Logan, 22 F. Supp. 2d 691, 694 (W.D. Mich. 1998) (Where a petitioner's claims ""could have been pursued in a  2255 motion, they cannot come through the audita querela backdoor.""). Durrani is not now raising a new defense, rather he is raising the same defense that he previously raised on direct appeal and in his section 2255 petition, which was dismissed with prejudice. In addition, audita querela is not available because the relief Durrani seeks was available through alternative post-conviction remedies. Accordingly, Durrani's petition for audita querela must be denied.  D. Discovery In the alternative to granting the current petition, Durrani requests the court to permit him to conduct ""very limited narrow supervised discovery."" Tr. 07/25/03, at 19. Durrani's version of ""very limited narrow discovery"" includes requesting all documents that reference Durrani, Pires, or the companies involved in the shipment of arms to Iran, that are in the possession of the: Central 20   Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, National Security Counsel, National archives, INS and the United States Attorney's Office. Id. at 20. In light of the Second Circuit's statement that, ""[b]ecause of the similarities between coram nobis proceedings and section 2255 proceedings, the section 2255 procedure often is applied by analogy in coram nobis case,"" United States v. Mandanici, 205 F.3d 519 (quoting Fleming, 146 F.3d at 90 n.2) (internal quotation marks omitted), the section 2255 standard for permitting discovery will be applied to the present coram nobis petition. Accordingly, Durrani is not ""entitled to discovery as a matter of course, but must show good cause for his request."" Perez v. United States, 274 F. Supp. 2d 330, 336 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904 (1997)). Durrani argues that, because the document referenced in Exhibit 8 was not disclosed, it is likely that there are other documents that also were not disclosed. See Tr. 07/25/03, at 29. In addition, Durrani argues that, because the burden on the government to produce documents created or maintained over the past two decades is minimal, justice requires discovery if there is even the ""slightest"" chance of discovering Brady material. Id. at 27. Durrani is not permitted additional discovery. Durrani was convicted in 1987. He has sought post-conviction relief through direct appeal, a Rule 35 motion, and a section 2255 motion on the same issue that he raises in the current petition. He has previously been given extensive discovery on the exact same issue. Moreover, if he needed additional discovery in 1992, then he should have appealed Judge Daly's ruling rather than petition the court ten years after the habeas corpus deadline passed. In the current petition, Durrani presents no credible evidence that the government possesses Brady material. Given the lack of a colorable claim, the time delay, and the inevitably enormous burden that would be placed on the government and its agencies to comply with Durrani's discovery requests, 21   Durrani's request must be denied. See Perez, 274 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (denying a discovery request when it is appropriately characterized as a ""mere fishing expedition""). III. Conclusion Durrani's petition for a writ of coram nobis or audita querela [doc. # 1] is DENIED. In addition, Durrani's request to conduct discovery [doc. #1] is also DENIED. The clerk shall close this file. It is so ordered. Dated at Bridgeport, Connecticut, this _____ day of November 2003.  __________________________ Stefan R. Underhill United States District Judge  22"

When recipients open          the email, they find an advertisement for the sale of toner, inkjets and          other printing supplies.         ""The defendants were trying to make people believe they were receiving          important information from someone they already knew, when, in fact, it          was nothing more than a commercial pitch,"" said Attorney General          Christine Gregoire. ""When email spam is misleading and deceptive,          it's more than just annoying. In Washington, it's illegal.""         The lawsuit contends the emails violate the state's Unsolicited Electronic          Mail Act, which outlaws misleading and deceptive subject lines and false          sender information that conceals the email's true source. The Attorney          General's Office believes the defendants have sent thousands of emails          to Washington residents.          In a unique public-private partnership, Microsoft helped in this lawsuit          by supplying investigative information about the defendants, as well as          providing information about deceptive emails sent through their Hotmail          system to Washington addresses. Gregoire praised Microsoft for helping          her office with this case.         ""The filing of this case shows that the partnership of business,          government and consumers is effective. Spammers should be prepared to          defend themselves in court, overcome increasingly effective anti-spam          technology, and face better educated consumers,"" said Gregoire.         The Attorney General's Office is asking for a court order to permanently          ban further deceptive emails and is seeking up to $2,000 in civil penalties          per violation.

GX006-23-6554168	"For Release:   April                 17, 2003 FTC Asks Court to Block                 Deceptive Spam Operation                   Misleading Subject Lines Allegedly                 Exposed Unwitting Consumers to Sexually Explicit Material                   The Federal Trade Commission has asked a U.S. District                 court judge to block an allegedly illegal spam operation that uses deceptively bland                 subject lines, false return addresses, and empty ""reply-to"" links to expose                 unsuspecting consumers, including children, to sexually explicit material. The agency                 alleges that Brian Westby used the spam in an attempt to drive business to an adult Web                 site, ""Married But Lonely."" The FTC has asked the court to order a halt to the                 deceptive spam, pending trial. It will seek a permanent injunction at trial.                   According to the FTC complaint, the defendant sent spam                 with subject lines that would disguise the contents of the e-mail. For example, subject                 lines have included ""Did you hear the news?"" and ""New movie info.""                 When consumers opened the e-mail messages, they were immediately subjected to sexually                 explicit solicitations to visit the defendant's adult-oriented Web sites. Because of the                 deceptive subject lines, consumers had no reason to expect to see such material, the FTC                 alleges. In some cases, consumers may have opened the e-mails in their offices, in                 violation of company policies. In other cases, children may have been exposed to                 inappropriate adult-oriented material, the FTC complaint notes. The defendant's spam                 provides a hyperlink or an e-mail address for consumers who wish to                 ""unsubscribe""or stop receiving e-mail in the future. According to the FTC, when                 consumers used the hyperlink or e-mail address in an attempt to get off the mailing list,                 they received an error message - they could not unsubscribe.                   The FTC also alleges that the defendant used false                 ""reply to"" or ""from"" information in the e-mail, making it appear that                 some innocent third party was the sender. This practice is known as ""spoofing.""                 As a result, thousands of undeliverable e-mails flooded back to the computer systems of                 these third parties, deluging their computer systems with an influx of spam that couldn't                 be delivered to the addressee. In addition, it unfairly portrayed these innocent                 bystanders as duplicitous spammers, often resulting in their receiving hundreds of angry                 e-mails from those that had been spammed, according to the FTC.                   In papers filed with the court, the agency says the                 deceptive practices violate the FTC Act. The complaint says the defendant and his                 businesses have and will continue to injure consumers, and that the defendant has been                 unjustly enriched as the result of his illegal scheme. The agency has asked the court to                 halt the scheme.                   Brian D. Westby is based in the St. Louis, Missouri suburb                 of Ballwin.                   The FTC vote to file the complaint was 5-0. It was filed in                 U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

The suit names a California company and its two owners/operators.   ""Spamming is the scourge of the Information Age.  It burdens the Internet system, costs individuals and businesses an estimated $8 billion a year and is extremely annoying to those who find their e-mails clogged with electronic junk mail,"" Lockyer said.  ""In filing this action, we are sounding a warning that we will track down and prosecute those who send illegal spam.""   Named as defendants are Paul Willis of Northridge and Claudia Griffin of Canyon Country, as well as their company, PW Marketing LLC.  The defendants are alleged to have sent millions of illegal, unsolicited commercial e-mails promoting products that the company claims will help others make money through spamming.  The company's unsolicited e-mails advertise books, software and lists of e-mail addresses, including one list purported to contain only e-mail addresses of California residents.   Filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court, the lawsuit alleges the company violated various California consumer protection statutes that prohibit the sending of spam, using false addresses in advertising, failing to disclose required information, engaging in untrue or deceptive advertising and engaging in unfair business competition.     Since 1998, California has prohibited individuals and companies from sending commercial e-mail to those who have neither requested nor consented to receive the e-mail, or with whom they do not have an existing business or personal relationship, unless:      The sender has either established a toll-free telephone number that recipients can call to stop future e-mails or included a valid e-mail address that recipients can contact to stop future e-mails;    And the subject line of the e-mail begins with the four characters ""ADV:"" designating it as commercial communication, or ""ADV:ADLT"" designating it as sexual, adult material.    The state lawsuit seeks an injunction prohibiting the owners from engaging in the unlawful activities and civil penalties of $2,500 for each violation of state law by both individual defendants, or at least $2 million.    The lawsuit  filed against Willis, Griffin and PW Marketing is the first that the office has brought on behalf of the people of California. The Attorney General's Office recently defended the constitutionality of the California statute in a friend of the court brief in a case brought against spammers by private individuals. In that case, Ferguson v. Friendfinders, Inc., (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1255, the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled that California's anti-spam law is constitutional.   Lockyer noted spam cases can be difficult to investigate. ""It is costly and time-consuming to track down spammers who often hide their identities and locations by routing, or 'relaying,' their solicitations through unsuspecting or unprotected Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or the mail servers of innocent third parties,"" he said.   Even when spammers include mailing addresses and phone numbers that make it easier to track them, prosecutors need the help of consumers. Under California law, spam is not illegal unless it is actually received by a California resident. Lockyer encouraged California consumers who believe they are targets of illegal commercial e-mails to contact their local prosecutors or file complaints with the Attorney General's Office.

""Spam is an annoying invasion of privacy for our citizens and a costly burden to our businesses at a time when we're trying get the economy back on track,"" said Lockyer.  ""We will continue to strongly enforce our anti-spam laws to protect Californians from this high tech pollutant.  Spam cost American businesses about $9 billion in lost productivity and screening expenses in 2002, when spam accounted for roughly 40 percent of all email.""   The  judgment  entered by the court today came in the first action filed by the State of California under its anti-spam law.  Lockyer filed the lawsuit in September 2002.   Besides the $2 million in civil penalties, the judgment substantially restricts the business practices of PW Marketing, Willis and Griffin.  In future enforcement actions, the Attorney General's Office will use these ""injunctive relief "" provisions as a model.  Specifically, the provisions prohibit the defendants from:      Sending unsolicited commercial emails.   Disguising their identity by sending email that appears to originate from an email address that is neither the actual address nor the address where replies can be received.   Sending emails that contain false or misleading information about the country or Internet mail server from where the advertisement is sent.   Accessing and using the computers, computer systems or computer networks of other persons or businesses without their permission or in violation of their terms of service.   Using false or misleading information to register for an email address, Internet service or Internet domain name.   Using, transferring or otherwise making available to other persons email address lists compiled for the purpose of sending spam.   For 10 years, owning, managing or holding any economic interest in any company that advertises over the Internet, without first providing written notice to the Attorney General.    The lawsuit alleged the defendants sent millions of unsolicited email advertisements promoting products that PW Marketing claimed would help the recipients make money through spam.  The defendants' spam hawked books, software and lists of email addresses.   California's anti-spam law will be strengthened under a new statute that takes effect Jan. 1, 2004 (SB 186, Murray).  The law prohibits unsolicited email advertisements sent to or from any California email address, unless the recipient gives prior permission (under current law the recipient has to opt out), or has an existing business relationship with the sender.  It also permits private individuals to sue spammers and collect actual damages, plus $1,000 per email and up to $1 million per incident.   Lockyer encouraged Californians who believe they have received spam to file complaints with the Attorney General's Office.  Complaints can be filed by writing the Public Inquiry Unit at P.O.

Sweeney, is a Senior Regional Economist with the Corps.  Dr. Sweeney alleged to OSC that Corps officials manipulated the cost benefit analysis on the feasibility of wide-scale improvements to the navigation system on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway in a way that resulted in a positive proposal for unnecessary and expensive improvements potentially costing in excess of one billion dollars.  The whistleblower alleged that Corps officials failed to comply with appropriate laws, rules and regulations when they manipulated key variables pertaining to the required cost benefit analysis contained in the Corps’ feasibility report.        The whistleblower was the original technical manager of the economic study of the project.  Based upon the information that he provided to the OSC, Special Counsel Elaine Kaplan determined that there exists a substantial likelihood that officials in the Corps have engaged in violations of law, rule or regulation and a gross waste of funds.        Pursuant to her statutory obligation (5 U.S.C. § 1213) Special Counsel Kaplan requested that the Secretary of Defense investigate Dr. Sweeney’s allegations and report back to OSC the Department of Defense’s findings, including the corrective actions it intends to take, within the statutory time frame of sixty days.        The OSC is an independent federal agency.  In addition to investigating and prosecuting complaints of unlawful retaliation, the OSC provides federal employees with a secure channel for blowing the whistle on violations of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement or waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.  By law, the OSC is empowered to require agencies to conduct investigations and report back to OSC whenever the Special Counsel finds a substantial likelihood that a federal employee’s disclosures demonstrate the existence of one of these conditions.

Boldt, Administrative Law Judge. At the request of the petitioner, a formal written transcript was prepared and made available to the parties in August of 1995. The parties submitted written briefs and the last brief was received on November 6, 1995. In accordance with sets. 227.47 and 227.53(1)(c), Stats., the PARTIES to this proceeding are certified as follows: Petitioner, Mr. Kurt F. Froebel, by Attorney W illiam S. Roush, Jr. Davis & Kuehhau, S.C. 111 E. Kilboum Ave., Suite 1400 Milwaukee, W isconsin 53202-6613 W isconsin Department of Natural Resources,by Attorney Thomas F. Steidl P. 0. Box 7921 Madison, W isconsin 53707-7921 FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Funk ' Dam is located approximately one mile upstream of North Lake on the s Oconomowoc River in the Town of Merton,in the N.E. quarter of the N. W. quarter of Section 15, Township 8 Norm, Range 18 East, Waukesha County. The Old Mill Dam was built around 1850 and rebuilt in 1890 and 1928. The dam was washed out in 1965 and in March of 1975. At the time relevant to decision of this case, in the summer of 1992, the dam consisted of three stop log section gates, each 3 ' wide and a 60 ' wide emergency spillway. The dam also involved a 350 ' long earthen embankment.  >  i   343-92-322 Page 2 2. The dam washed out in 1965. In 1971, the Department notified dam owner Mr. Gerald Quinn that the dam was in poor condition and recommended repairs that were necessaryto properly maintain the dam. There was a subsequentdam failure on March 12, 1975. The Department of Natural Resourcesissued an order requiring Mr. Quinn to repair the dam on May 6, 1975. The Department attempted to hold Mr. Quinn accountable for dam repair and satisfying the DNR dam safety requirements. Quinn refused to comply with the Department ' orders. s On November 17, 1982, the Department issued a Determination that the dam 3. was unsafe and abandoned and a Notice of the Department ' intent to remove the darn. Mr. s Quinn challenged the Department ' Determination. However, the challenge was ultimately s dismissed by the W isconsin Court of AppeaIs on May 28, 1985. 4. On August 17, 1992, the DNR began its drawdown of the impoundment behind Funk ' Dam in anticipation of dam removal. On August 18, 1992, the Department s prepared a public notice requesting comments on its proposal to remove the Funk ' Dam. s The notice also sought public input on the Department of Natural Resources 'Environmental Assessment(EA) for removal of the project. On September 9, 1992, the DNR conducted a public informational hearing on 5. the proposed removal of the dam and on the EA for the project. On October 2, 1992, the Department ' contractor began removing Funk ' Dam. s s On October 12, 1992, the North Lake Management District filed a petition for 6. a contested case hearing challenging the Department ' decision to remove the dam. The s contested case hearing was stayed pending judicial resolution of the issue of whether or not there was a right to a contested case hearing under sec. 227.42, Stats., on the EA conducted by the DNR on the dam removal decision. See: North Lake Management District v. DNR, 182 W is. 2d 500 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994). The W isconsin Court of Appeals held that there was no such right. 7. Petitioner Kurt Froebel submitted a Notice of Appearance, Notice of Motion and Motion to Intervene in this administrative review proceeding on December 19, 1994. On January 23, 1995, the Division granted Petitioner Froebel ' motion to intervene and s Petitioner Froebel submitted a Petition for a Contested Case Hearing on February 1, 1995. At some point in 1986, Mike Bozek, of Water Resources, DNR Southeastern 8. District conducted a mill pond sediment survey of the potential depth and distribution and transport of sediment then located upstream of the Funk ' Dam. The object of the study was s an analysis attempting to predict the amount of sediment to be washed out of the impoundment should the dam be removed and identification of the fact that under a failure a larger amount could be removed. (Ex. 4) The Bozek study undertook a cross section or transection across the stream channel to identify soft, transportable sediments as well as   3-83-92-322 Page 3 compacted sediments. Bozek used a 1.5 inch diameter stick and poked the stick into the impoundment sediments in order to measurethe amount of soft sediment potentially transportable. The pole method employed by Mr. Bozek was reasonableand appropriate under the circumstances. The methodology has been used by other experts in the field and is very similar to a technique used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. (TR, pp. 676-677) Bozek calculated a range of from 93 to 186 yards (80 percent water) to 23 to 46 yards (95 percent water) for the amount of sediment expected to be transported out of the channel and deposited downstream to the river and into North Lake. Bozek further estimated that 90 percent of the total potential sediment load was transported downstream when the dam failed in 1975. The parties essentially agree that an error was made in Bozek ' calculations. The s 1994 R A Smith Study concluded that the Bozek study made an error in calculating the volume of transect 1 and that the correct range was ""actually 610 to 1,220 cubic yards. "" The Bozek study underestimated the potential sediment available for transport upon removal of the dam and drawdown of the impoundment. However, the record is not clear as to how this underestimation affected the DNR drawdown/removal plans. Plainly, the Bozek study contemplated a potentially large volume of soft sediment available for transport. Further, in the EA, the Department observed that ""an increase in the sediment load to the lake is expected during drawdown. "" (Ex. 8) 9. In August, 1991 the State Legislature passedlegislation which authorized annual appropriations for fiscal years 1991-92 and 1992-93 for the removal of abandoned dams in the state by the Department of Natural Resources. Once appropriated funds became available, the Department began the process to remove Funk ' Dam. A drawdown plan for s the impoundment behind the dam was developed by W illiam Sturtevant, Assistant State Dam Safety Engineer. (Ex. 5) 10. There is no real factual question that Funk ' dam was unsafe and was s dangerous to life health and property prior to removal by the Department. The Depamnent was very concerned about the potential of flooding resulting from dam failure. A 1982 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study determined that the dam provided no meaningful flood control for North Lake. Removal of the dam was expected to improve storage capacity of the floodplain and increase flood control for North Lake. (TR, pp. 168, 233, Ex. 8) Sturtevant conducted a ten-year inspection in 1988 and found the dam to be in very poor condition. The Department also believed that removal of the dam would reduce sediment transport in the area by stabilizing bottom sediments in the mill pond. (Ex. 8) A clear preponderance of the credible evidence supports a Finding that the Department ' decision to s remove the Funk ' dam was reasonablegiven Department concerns about public safety and s sediment transport.   3-SE-92-322 Page 4 11. The central issue in the case is whether the Department ' implementation of its s decision to remove the Funk ' dam was reasonable,necessaryand appropriate based upon s information foreseeabIeto the DNR at the time of dam removal. The Bozek smdy made several recommendationsto reduce the mass of sediment transported downstream: 1) Slowly lower water levels in the impoundment during dam removal. 2) Using a crane, dig a sedimentation pit in front of the present dam to act as in channel sediment pit. The crane can both be used to disassemblethe dam and dredge the sedimentation pit as it fills during drawdown. Spoils should not be deposited in the wetlands adjacent to the channel. 3) Only one dam structure should be removed to concentrate flow through one stream channel and maximize depth there during low flows. 4) Mud flat areas should be seededwith a wildlife seed mixture to stabilize these areas. (Ex. 4, pp. 6-7) At some unknown time in 1992, DNR Assistant Dam Safety Engineer W illiam 12. Sturtevant prepared a formal drawdown plan (Ex. 5) which set forth minimum requirements for the contractor undertaking draining of the ml11pond. A summary of the features of the drawdown plan is as follows: Steps and procedures for draining of the Funk ' mill pond are: s A. Erosion control in me form of a sediment barriers/traps must be placed prior to the initiation of the drawdown. Barriers are required to be installed both upstream and downstream of the dam. Install combination of pump(s) and syphons along the embankment and start draining the pond. Lift the top board of the gated section of the dam l/2 of its vertical dimension. As the pond is drained, rocks are to be removed from the breached section of the dam equal in elevation to the water level in the pond. Allow the pond to dram until the water level has stabilized at an elevation even with the bottom of the raised board. Continue to work at removing the rocks and concrete in me breached section of the dam as the water levels in the pond recede. The river will form a channel upstream of the breached section. Once use of the pumps and syphons becomes inefficient, remove the rocks and  B. C. D.  E.  F.   3-SE-92-322 Page 5 concrete in the breached section of the dam until the pond is completely drained. G. Remove rock and concrete fill in the existing breach area so as to drain the remaining portion of the pond at a rate not to exceed 0.5 feet per day. The breached section of the dam is to be opened up to a bottom dimension of no less than 45 feet with 3: 1 (horizontal:vertical) side slopes. The rock and concrete removed from the breach area shall be used along the side slopes of the breach in order to reduce further erosion of the earthen embankment. Sediment collected in the downstream sediment trap shall be left in place if outside the defined stream channel and removed by hand if deposited in the stream channel. (Ex. 5)  H.  I.  J.  There is no question that some significant features of both the Bozek 13. recommendationsand of the Sturtevant drawdown plan were not followed during dam removal. No sediment pit or basin was created upstream of the dam as recommended by Bozek. No sediment trap or barrier was placed upstream of the dam as contemplated by the drawdown plan. Downstream sediment traps were not effective nor properly pumped by the contractor. No pumps and siphons were installed along the embankment prior to drainage. Nor was all of the dam removed. The Department argues that on-site conditions made it infeasible to follow all of the above recommendationsand that there were legitimate reasons for the failure to follow the particulars of the drawdown and removal plans. The petitioner argues that failure to follow the plans and to undertake certain other sediment control measuresled to massive sediment dischargesthat could have been prevented. Accordingly, the alleged defects must be considered separately and as a whole to properly determine the reasonableness the Deparmrent ' implementation of the dam removal. of s 14. UW-Milwaukee Professor Jerry Kaster of the Great Lake Studies and Biological SciencesDepartment, testified on behalf of the petitioner. Kaster testified that excess amounts of sediments transported were the result of the Department ' failure to build s a large sediment settling basin, preferably in front of the dam spillway. (TR, p. 591) Kaster concluded as follows: the fact is that neither of these settling basins were constructed as recommendedby the DNR personnel. And that ' s   3-SE-92-322 Page 6 where the trouble began. It is possible to retain sediment, but it has to be done in a proper way, and it just -- I mean, when you walk on site and see what had been constructed to retain that sediment, the first thing anyone could do, including a lay person, is shake their head. Those sediment basins were simply too small. Id. The DNR argues that it was impossible to build the upstream sediment basin because of engineering problems in creating a basin large enough to be effective. The Department argues further that efforts to create such a basin would have re-suspendedvirtually ail of the sediment in the impoundment and released a much larger volume of sediment. However, it is not at all clear from the record why these conditions were not foreseeable to Department personnel. As early as 1986, as the EA notes, the Department estimated a cost of $2500.00 for construction of a sedimentation basin. (Ex. 8, p. 2) The Department was well aware of public concerns relating to the release of sediment at the time of dam removal. The record is replete with concerns on this exact issue expressedwell prior to design of the drawdown plan. Further, prior to the implementation of dam removal, Sturtevant had been to the site at least five or six times. (TR, p. 31) Sturtevant was aware or should have been aware of the soft sediment in the area, the lack of room for a large settling basin and the size of the impoundment. If the DNR was unable to overseeconstruction of such a settling basin in front of the spillway, Kaster opined, then the Department should have followed the recommendationsdescribed by former DNR water quality planner Neil O ' Reilly. (TR, pp. 591, Ex. 43) O ' Reilly prepared a RecommendedErosion Control Plan that included specific plans for the placement of a sedimentation basin in front of, that is upstream of, the Funk Road Bridge. O ' Reilly recommendedthat such a basin could have been constructed by placing either a sandbag dike, or steel or wood sheet pile structure in front of three culverts in the area to create a controlled impounded area. (Id.) The record does not adequately explain why the measuresrecommendedby Bozek and O ' Reilly could not be implemented. (TR, pp. 700-701) Further, if larger sedimentation basins could not have been constructed, the Department should not have representedto the public that it would build them, nor that the DNR ' efforts to collect sediment would be adequateto protect the navigable waters of s the river and North Lake. 15. Other suggestederosion control features were not followed. The downstream sediment basins were too small to be effective. The drawdown plan called for pumping of downstream sediment traps. Stmtevant testified that the Department twice tried to pump the sediment traps but that these efforts were unsuccessfulbecausethe material was so fine it resuspendeditself before the suction hoses could become operative. (TR, p. 65) North Lake Management Commissioner Terry Prust testified that he had actually observed the Department ' contractor pumping sediment from silt traps back into the river. (TR, p. 4.51) s When Prust asked them what they were doing, the contractor ' excuse was that the DNR did s not tell them what to do with it. In fairness to the Department, this was clearly not true, as s the Department ' bidding contract clearly specified areas to deposit this sediment. Prust   343-92-322 Page 7  concluded that the whole operation did not work as the DNR had hoped it would and that the drawdown was not undertaken professionally or well planned. (TR, p. 455) 16. Heavy rams occurred during the drawdown and removal efforts, causing the impoundment to fill several times. This required further drawdowns and discharged additional sediment into the river and lake. (TR, p. 300) 17. As noted, not all of the dam was removed as had been hoped. The Department ' EA had warned against partial removal of the dam for the following reasons: s Remove the existing concrete spillway and emergency spillway. This option would leave the placement of the earthen embankment. While eliminating some of the water quality problems the most significant drawback to this option would be the potential failure of the earthen embankment during high water. The RA Smith 1995 draft study concluded that this prediction had essentially come true and that the streambank erosion near the dam needed to be stabilized after the partial dam removal. The RA Smith study suggestedthat streambankswould benefit from placement of rock riprap on the 100 feet of streambank on the east bank downstream from the outlet. The study also recommendedthat the structural integrity of dam breach itself be stabilized. (Ex. 24, Chapter 4) 18. A considerable amount of sediment was discharged into the Oconomowoc River as a result of the removal of Funk ' Dam. The petitioners established through s photographs and testimony that large new muck and silt bars were formed after the dam abandonment. (TR, pp. 619-620; Exs. 32-35) Formation of these unstable mud flat areas were the direct result of the dam removal. The R.A. Smith sediment analysis concluded that the partial dam removal was ""likely responsible ""for the recent sediment deposits downstream in the Oconomowoc River and in North Lake. The report noted that there are noticeable sediment beds downstream of the STH 83 bridge and in the inlet to North lake; and these beds have possible negative effects on the fishery of the river and lake as well as the water clarity of the lake. (Ex. 25, Conclusions) Further, the petitioners establishedthat a large amount of silt not visible from the land surface was deposited into North Lake (TR, p. 573) and that such a volume of sediment would be damaging to organisms in the river and lake. (Kaster, TR, p. 594) Kaster performed testing of sediment transport from the Funk ' Dam mill pond to s North Lake before during and after the drawdown and partial removal of the dam. All of these studies confined that a large volume of sediment was transported as a result of the dam removal and that hundreds of tons of excesssediment continue to be deposited in North Lake as a result of the partial dam removal. (TR, pp. 584-585)   0  3-SE-92-322 Page 8 19. A preponderance of the credible evidence supports a finding that a large amount of sediment was discharged into the Oconomowoc river and into North Lake as a result of the partial removal of the Funk ' dam. The record taken as a whole also establishes s that these navigable waterways have been detrimentally impacted by the manner in which the partial dam removal was undertaken. It is difficult to sort out what portion of the increase of sediment transport is directly the result of the failure of the Department and its contractor to undertake the dam removal in a manner that better limited sediment transport. What is clear from the record is that the possibility of transport of a large amount of sediment was foreseeableto the Department. The DNR had sound reasons for removal of the dam; the Department properly planned for remova of the dam. However, as the dam was removed, the Department was too quick to throw out its drawdown and removal plans as being impossible to perform. While it is difficult to sort through the cause and effect of the Department ' actions in this case, the evidence supports a finding that the failure to follow s the recommended drawdown and removal plans was a cause of the release of a large volume of sediment into public waters. This case has a unique and extensive procedural posture that raise serious 20. issuesas to the jurisdiction and authority of the ALJ. This case was not noticed as an enforcement action or as a hearing on the reasonableness necessity for any remedial or actions by the Department or its contractor. There is no specific statutory authority for the ALJ to Order remedial actions by the Department or its contractor in light of the Division ' s conclusion that the failure to follow the drawdown and removal plan contributed to the release of sediment into the waters of the state. Under these circumstances, the ALJ believes the best course is to remand the case back to the Department to take such actrons as the DNR sees fit under the circumstances. 21. The Department did not error in failing to require a W isconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WADES) permit in connection with dam removal. Vollbrecht and Sturtevant testified that the Department does not require WPDES permits for dam removal in addition to permits under Chapter 31. Vollbrecht testified that such a WPDES permit would likely have had similar conditions as the Chapter 31 permits. 22. The restoration of the dam is not feasible and may result in the transport of significant amounts of sediment. At the hearing prior petitioner counsel Lonsdorf essentially waived the issue of reconstruction of the dam, stating that the petitioner had no interest in putting back the dam. Further, reconstruction of the dam to meet existing dam standards would cost several hundred thousands of dollars. There is nothing in the record that any party would be willing to assumeownership and maintenance of the dam in the event it was reconstructed. Taken as a whole, there is no evidence in the record which would justify the extreme step of reconstruction of the dam. Further, this issue is outside the scope of the review of me reasonableness and necessity for the decison to remove Funk ' dam. of s   .  io  3-SE-92-322 Page 9 DISCUSSION Several years have passed since the removal of the Funk ' Dam in the late summer of s 1992. The contested case was continued for over two years, as North Lake Management District (NLMD) pursued the Environmental Assessmentissuesin the appellate courts. This decision, accordingly, will reflect a degree of hindsight not available to Department employees at the time of removal of the dam. The Department properly sought removal of an abandoned and unsafe dam. The DNR ' efforts to plan for removal of the dam were s reasonable. The actual removal was plagued by heavy rains, which played a big part in the release of far more sediment into the Oconomowoc river and North Lake man expected. Further, on site conditions made it difficult to follow the Department ' plans, and the s Department ' contractor apparently employed individuals who did not understand the basic s purpose of sediment traps. The result was release of a large amount of sediment into the river and lake. The parties both raise legal issuesas to the jurisdiction of the ALJ to order the Department to take remedial measuresnearly four years after the underlying events in this case. The Department argues under Village of Thiensville v. DNR, 130 Wis. 2d 276, 386 N.W.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1986), that the Department ' decision must be reviewed m terms of s the data and information available to the Department at the time the decision to remove the dam was made. Village of Thiensville, was a WPDES case interpreting sec. 147.20(1)(b), Stats. The Court of Appeals held, first, that the hearing examiner properly refused to admit evidence or to allow any challenge to WPDES permit terms that were not affected by the specific permit modification noticed by the Department. Other conditions of the permit, not modified by the DNR and not timely appealed by the petitioner, were held to be outside the review under sec. 147.20, Stats. Id., p. 282 Secondly, the Court of Appeals held that sec. 147.20, Stats. required that me hearing examiner limit his review to events which had been considered by the DNR. Id., p. 283. Village of Thiensville, therefore, affords administrative agencies fimdamental fairness in ensuring that review proceedings have finality and focus on the issues at hand or reasonably foreseeableto the Department. While Village of Thiensville is not a Chapter 30, Stats. case the ALJ believes these principles should be operative in most administrative review proceedings. The ALJ finds that the question of and sediment loading into the river and lake are directly related to the reasonableness necessity of the drawdown and removal efforts and that these issueswere reasonably foreseeable to me Department. (See: Finding #14) The RA Smith studies are therefore considered only for the limited purpose of correcting and commenting upon information available or reasonably foreseeable to the Department. The instant hearing was not noticed or contemplated as a hearing on the appropriatenessof possible plans to remediate sediment loadings. The petitioner argues that the ALJ has authority to Order remedial measuresby the Department pursuant to sec. 30.03(4)(a), Stats. It seemsclear that this provision governs Chapter 3 1, Stats., proceedings as well as those specifically under Chapter 30, Stats. Sec. 30.03(2), Stats., states that me   3-SE-92-322 Page 10 attorney general is authorized to bring proceedings to ""abate any nuisance committed under this chapter or Ch. 31. "" Sec. 30.03(4)(a), Stats., states in pertinent part: If the department learns of. a possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters, and the department determines that the public interest may not be adequately served by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture, the department may proceed as provided in this The department may order a hearing under ch. 227 paragraph . concerning the possible . mfringement, and may request the hearing examiner to issue an order directing the responsible parties to perform or refrain from performing acts in order to fully protect the interests of the public in the navigable waters. . The petitioner argues that this section authorizes the AU to enter ""whatever injunctive orders are necessaryto effectuate the purposes of the statutes--m this case to order restoration of the environmental conditions of the former Funk ' Dam impoundment, the s Oconomowoc River and North Lake. "" (Petitioner ' Brief, p. 30) s The ALJ believes the petitioner overstatesthe authority of the Division in this matter. On its face, sec. 30.03, Stats., requires ""a hearing under ch. 227 "" specifically relating to a ""possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters. "" As DNR counsel notes, the instant proceeding was not noticed as a sec. 30.03, Stats., enforcement proceeding. Further, such a hearing is contemplated under the statutes only in instances were ""the department determines that the public interest may not be adequately served by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture. "" In this case, the Division lacks authority to impose a forfeiture or penalty upon the Department. The record would not support entry of such a forfeiture or penalty in any event, as the department has not violated any prior condition or order justifying entry of such a forfeiture. Accordingly, sec. 30.03, Stats. does not provide authority for the ALJ to reach the issue of the proper remedies to restore the environment in light of the release of sediment. The Petitioner also argues that sec. 31.185(5), Stats., provides a basis for legal authority for the Division to order that remedial actions be undertaken by the Department. However, this provision is inapplicable to the present situation. On its face, sec. 31.185(5), Stats., applies only in caseswhere DNR is issuing a permit to an applicant to abandon a dam. That statutory subsectionprovides: 31.185(5) As a prerequisite to the granting of a permit under this section, the department may require the applicant to comply with such conditions as it deems reasonably necessaryin the particular case to   3-SE-92-322 Page 11 preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and to protect life, health and property. It is evident that this statutory provision is inapplicable to the current proceedings smce the DNR is not required to obtain a permit to abandon a dam, but is specifically authorized under sec. 31.187, Stats., to remove abandoned dams. The ALJ concludes that the Division does not have authority to Order the Department to draw up a remedial plan to addressthe sediment loading in the Oconomowoc River and North Lake. Administrative agencieshave only such powers as are expressly granted to them or necessarily implied and any power sought to be exercised must be found within the four comers of the statute under which the agency proceeds. American Brass Co. v. State Board of Health, 243 W is. 440, (1944). The ALI can find no express nor necessarily implied authority to order remedial actions by the DNR under this unique fact situation. Further, it would be timdamentally unfair to require specific remedial actions by the DNR when the Department has not had the opportunity to specifically addressthese Issuesat hearing. As a practical matter, on the basis of the limited and largely one-sided evidence presented at hearing, some remedial actions by the Department or its contractor would appear to be in order. The RA Smith 1995 draft study may well represent a basis for the restoration of the river and the stabilization of the area to prevent further sediment loading into these waters. However, it is not for the AIJ to determine that issue definitively in the context of the present proceeding. The petitioner argues that the DNR did not allow sufficient opportunity for public comment prior to the decision to remove the dam. The public informational hearing in this case was held after the slow drawdown was begun. Clearly, the better practice would be to begin drawdown of an abandoned dam to be removed after holding the required public informational hearing. However, Department did comply with the procedural requirements by holding the September 9, 1992, public informational hearing prior to the actual removal of the dam. This is all that is required under sec. 31.253, Stats. Overall, this case and the participation of the petitioner, who did not himself file a petition to review until after the withdrawal of the NLMD request for a hearing, speak volumes as to the Department ' efforts s to include the public in its Chapter 31, Stats. process. Finally, the AIJ does not accept the proposition that the DNR needed to require a WPDES permit in connection with its dam removal efforts. Department witnesses testified that the conditions of such a permit would clearly overlap with requirements for dam removal. Accordingly, the petitioners arguments as to requirement of an additional WPDES permit are without merit.   3-SE-92-322 Page 12 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The Division of Hearings and Appeals has authority pursuant to Ch. 31 and sec. 227.43(l)(b), Stats., and in accordancewith the foregoing Findings of Fact to hear contested cases and issue certain statutorily defined necessaryOrders in casesinvolving abandonmentof dams on navigable waters. 2. Section 3 1.185(5) states that as a prerequisite to the granting of a permit to abandon a dam the Department may require the applicant to comply with such conditions as it deems reasonably necessaryin the particular case to preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and to protect life, health and property. The DNR may remove or cause to be removed, in such manner as it deems 3. fit, old and abandoned dams in this state, upon giving 60 days notice in writing to the owner thereof, if the owner can be found. Sec. 31.187(2). The Department met all procedural requirements, of this section by issuing Notice of Intent to remove Funk ' Dam on s November 1, 1982, pursuant to then sec. 29.04, Stats. 4. Section 31.253, Stats. requires that the DNR hold a public informational hearing on the proposed removal of a dam when such a hearing is requested, as in the instant case, prior to seeking or causing the removal of the dam under Chapter 31, Stats. The DNR complied with this procedural requirement by conducting a public informatlonal hearing on September9, 1992 in the Town of Merton. The DNR has authority, in the interest of public rights in navigable waters or 5. to promote safety and protect life, health and property, to regulate and control the level and flow of water in all navigable waters pursuant to sec. 31.02(l), Stats. This section does not specifically authorize the Department to begin the drawdown process for dam removal without entry of a specific order by the DNR. No such order was entered in this matter. Section 30.03(2), Stats., statesthat the attorney general is authorized to bring 6. proceedings to ""abate any nuisance committed under this chapter or Ch. 3 1. "" Section 30,03(4)(a), Stats., states in pertinent part: If the department leams of . a possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters, and the department determines that the public interest may not be adequatelyserved by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture, the depamnent may proceed as provided in this paragraph . . The department may order a hearing under Ch. 227 concerning the possible infringement, and may request the hearing examiner to issue an order directing the responsible parties to perform or refrain from performing acts in order to fully protect the interests of the public in the navigable waters   3-SE-92-322 Page 13 The instant contestedcase hearing was not noticed as an enforcement proceeding under this subsection, nor would it have been appropriate to have done so. Section 30.03, Stats., does not provide legal authority for the Division to Order specific remedial actions in this matter. 7. Under Village of Thiensville v. DNR, 130 W is. 2d 276, 386 N.W.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1986), the Department ' decision must be reviewed in terms of the data and s information available to the Department at the time the decision to remove the dam was made. The ALJ has relied upon the subsequentRA Smith studies for the limited purpose of correcting errors in earlier Department calculation of sediment loadings and commenting on information available to the DNR at the time of its decision to remove the dam. 8. The DNR in seeking removal of the Funk ' Dam was not ""the owner or s operator of a point source discharging Pollutants into the waters of the state "" within the meaning of sec. 147.025(l), Stats. No WPDES permit is necessaryin connection with either removal of the dam or any continuing sediment transport emanating from the Funk ' Dam. s ORDER Wherefore IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that this matter be REMANDED back to the Department of Natural Resourcesfor such actions as the agency in its discretion deems appropriate.

GX011-97-13607011	"MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION et al., Plaintiffs and Appellants,   v.  FISH AND GAME COMMISSION, Defendant and Appellant;  COUNTY OF KERN DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES,  Real Party in Interest and Appellant.    S053508    SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA    16 Cal. 4th 105    July 31, 1997, Filed      Daniel E. Lungren, Attorney General, Roderick E. Walston, Chief Assistant Attorney General, Charles W. Getz IV, Assistant Attorney General, and John Davidson, Deputy Attorney General, for Defendant and Appellant.     Joseph J. Brecher, David L. Henkin and Joel R. Reynolds for Plaintiffs and Appellants.     B. C. Barnum, Sr., County Counsel, and Charles F. Collins, Deputy County Counsel, for Real Party in Interest and Appellant.     Robin L. Rivett and M. Reed Hopper as Amici Curiae on behalf of Defendant and Appellant and Real Party in Interest and Appellant.       The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) provides protection and management resources for certain native species of fish, wildlife, and plants in imminent danger of or threatened with extinction. Under CESA, the Fish and Game Commission (Commission) is assigned the task of establishing a list of endangered species and a list of threatened species. The Commission is required to add or remove species from either list when warranted, and to develop criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened.     The litigation in this case followed the Commission's decision to remove the Mojave ground squirrel from the threatened species list. The delisting decision was the first time since CESA's enactment that protection had been withdrawn from any species.     The Court of Appeal concluded the Commission abused its discretion in removing the ground squirrel from the list of threatened species because the Commission's failure to prepare and certify an environmental impact report (EIR) when evaluating the delisting petition violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). We conclude: (1) CESA can be harmonized with CEQA; (2) the Commission is entitled to an exemption from the EIR requirement of CEQA when it follows its certified regulatory program; and (3) the Commission abused its discretion in delisting the Mojave ground squirrel by failing to comply with its own procedures. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.     I. Background     In November 1991, the Commission accepted a petition from the Kern County Department of Planning and Development (Kern County) seeking removal of the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species. As part of a process lasting nearly two years, the Commission, with assistance from the Department of Fish and Game (Department), solicited public comment, obtained an independent review and report on the status of the ground squirrel, and, after conducting an extensive public hearing, decided to remove the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species.     Mountain Lion Foundation and others (hereafter referred to collectively as Mountain Lion) filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus seeking to set aside the Commission's decision. The petition alleged the Commission failed to meet the requirements of CESA, and the Commission's findings are not supported by substantial evidence. The petition also alleged the Commission's delisting was carried out in violation of CEQA. The trial court rejected Mountain Lion's CESA contentions. As to Mountain Lion's CEQA claim, however, the trial court determined that removing the ground squirrel from the threatened species list was an activity subject to CEQA, and that none of the exemptions to CEQA applied. Because the Commission had carried out the delisting without first preparing and certifying an EIR as required under CEQA, the court ordered the Commission to vacate its decision.     Mountain Lion appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of the Commission on the CESA claim, and the Commission and Kern County appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of Mountain Lion on the CEQA claim. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding the Commission did not violate CESA when it delisted the Mojave ground squirrel but it failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA by not preparing and certifying an EIR prior to the delisting.     We granted petitions for review by the Commission and by Kern County.     II. Discussion     CEQA is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term protection to the environment. (Pub. Resources Code,  21001; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted.) In enacting CEQA, the Legislature declared its intention that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their duties. (  21000, subd. (g); see generally,  Sierra Club v. Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1229, 876 P.2d 505,  hereafter Sierra Club; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.  Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 390, 253 Cal. Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278,  hereafter Laurel Heights;  Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal. 3d 929, 935, 231 Cal. Rptr. 748, 727 P.2d 1029.)  CEQA is to be interpreted ""to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247, 259, 104 Cal. Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049.)      Generally, CEQA applies to discretionary projects. (  21080, subd. (a).) A project is an activity undertaken by a public agency which may cause a physical change in the environment. (  21065; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  15378; all further citations to title 14, section 15000 et seq. of California Code of Regulations will be referred to as Guidelines.) A discretionary project is one subject to ""judgmental controls,"" i.e., where the agency can use its judgment in deciding whether and how to carry out the project. (Guidelines,  15002, subd. (i); cf.  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d 259, 271-273, 235 Cal. Rptr. 788  [distinguishing decisionmaking discretion subject to CEQA from ""ministerial"" activity that is not].)     If a public agency proposes to approve a discretionary project, the agency's activity may nonetheless be exempt from CEQA by legislative command. (See, e.g.,  21080, subd. (b) [exempting specific projects from CEQA]; see also  21080.01-21080.03 [exempting construction and maintenance of specified prison facilities]; see generally,  Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com. (1990) 50 Cal. 3d 370, 376, 267 Cal. Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976.)  Other classes of projects are ""categorically exempt"" from CEQA pursuant to administrative regulation because they do not have a significant effect on the environment. (  21084; see  No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal. 3d 68, 74, 118 Cal. Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66,  hereafter No Oil;  Dunn-Edwards Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 644, 653-655,  hereafter Dunn-Edwards.) Finally, CEQA does not apply if ""it can be seen with certainty"" that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment. (Guidelines,  15061, subd. (b)(3); see  No Oil, supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 74  [discretionary activity having no possibility of causing significant environmental effect not subject to CEQA].) A ""significant effect on the environment"" is a substantial or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment. (  21068.) "" 'Environment' "" is defined as the ""physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance."" (  21060.5.)     Whenever a project may have a significant and adverse physical effect on the environment, an EIR must be prepared and certified. (  21100, subd. (a); cf.  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 263, 277-279, 118 Cal. Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017;   City of Livermore v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1986) 184 Cal. App. 3d 531, 538, 230 Cal. Rptr. 867.)  An EIR provides the public and responsible government agencies with detailed information on the potential environmental consequences of an agency's proposed decision. (See generally,  No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 81;   Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307, 248 Cal. Rptr. 352.)  The EIR describes ways to minimize significant environmental effects, and suggests alternatives to the project, including the option of ""no project."" (  21061;  Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal. 3d at pp. 390-391;  see also Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(4) [""no project"" alternative to be considered along with proposed project's environmental impact].)     In some cases, notwithstanding a public agency's determination that a proposed activity may have a significant, adverse effect on the environment, an EIR is not required. Certain state agencies, operating under their own regulatory programs, generate a plan or other environmental review document that serves as a functional equivalent of an EIR. (  21080.5, subd. (a);  Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1229-1230;   Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 196, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537,  hereafter Wildlife Alive;  Citizens for Non-Toxic Pest Control v. Department of Food & Agriculture (1986) 187 Cal. App. 3d 1575, 1584, 232 Cal. Rptr. 729,  hereafter Citizens.) Because the plan or document is generally narrower in scope than an EIR, environmental review can be completed more expeditiously. (See Note, The Timber Harvest Plan Exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act: Due Process and Statutory Intent, 41 Hastings L.J. (1990) 727, 735.)     To qualify, the agency's regulatory program must be certified by the Secretary of the Resources Agency (Secretary). (  21080.5, subd. (e).) An agency operating pursuant to a certified regulatory program must comply with all of CEQA's other requirements. ( Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1228, 1230-1231;   Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal. App. 3d 1043, 1051, 263 Cal. Rptr. 104;   City of Sacramento v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 960, 976-978.)      A. Is There An Irreconcilable Conflict Between CESA And CEQA That Exempts The Commission's Delisting Decision From CEQA?     Kern County, joined by the Commission and amicus curiae Pacific Legal Foundation, contend there is an irreconcilable conflict between CESA and CEQA, and thus the Commission's actions pursuant to CESA must be exempt from the requirements of CEQA. As Kern County posits, CESA mandates a narrow, species-based focus that necessarily precludes consideration of many of the factors that must be evaluated in accordance with CEQA; thus, the Commission's compliance with CEQA will violate CESA.     1. California Endangered Species Act     To understand the interplay between the two statutory schemes, we review CESA in some detail. In 1970, California became one of the first states in the nation to protect endangered and rare animals. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1510,  3, p. 2998;  Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com. (1994) 28 Cal. App. 4th 1104, 1111.)  In 1984, these provisions were repealed and replaced with CESA. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1162,  5 & 6, p. 3988; id., ch. 1240,  1, p. 4243.) In enacting CESA, the Legislature expressly recognized that certain species of wildlife face extinction ""because their habitats are threatened with destruction, adverse modification, or severe curtailment, or because of overexploitation, disease, predation, or other factors."" (Fish & G. Code,  2051, subd. (b).) The Legislature further declared, ""It is the policy of the state to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat."" (Fish & G. Code,  2052.)     Under CESA, a native species of bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant is considered ""endangered"" when it ""is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range"" (Fish & G. Code,  2062), and ""threatened"" when it ""is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of . . . special protection and management efforts."" (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) The Commission is responsible for maintaining lists of endangered and threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2070.) CESA requires the Commission to add or remove species from either list ""if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information pursuant to [Fish and Game Code sections 2070-2079] that the action is warranted."" (Fish & G. Code,  2070.)     CESA requires the Commission to establish guidelines permitting interested parties to petition to add a species to, or remove a species from, the endangered or threatened species list, and directs the Department to recommend, and the Commission to adopt, criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened. (Fish & G. Code,  2071, 2071.5.) Accordingly, the Commission has regulations governing the submission and review of petitions for listing, ""uplisting,"" ""downlisting,"" and delisting endangered or threatened species. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1.)     CESA establishes a two-step process by which the Commission decides whether to add or remove a species from either the endangered or threatened species list. ( Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 28 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 1114-1115.)  First, a petition to list or delist must provide sufficient scientific information to show a listing or delisting may be warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2074.2, subd. (a).) For example, the petition must provide scientific information on the species population trend, range, distribution, abundance, and life history, and ""any other factors that the petitioner deems relevant."" (Fish & G. Code,  2072.3.) The petition is referred to the Department for evaluation and recommendation either to reject the petition for lack of sufficient scientific information indicating the action may be warranted, or to accept and consider the petition because it includes such information. (Fish & G. Code,  2073.5.) If the petition is sufficient and is accepted by the Commission, the Department prepares a written status report on the species. (Fish & G. Code,  2074.6.) Other interested parties may also submit written comments and scientific reports. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (h).)     On receipt of the Department's report and recommendation, the Commission schedules a hearing for final consideration of the petition (Fish & G. Code,  2075), and decides whether the petitioned action is warranted or not warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5.) Under regulations tracking the definition of endangered species contained in Fish and Game Code section 2062, the Commission is required to find a listing warranted if the continued existence of the species is in serious danger or threatened by any one or any combination of six factors, including ""1. Present or threatened modification or destruction of its habitat; [P] 2. Overexploitation; [P] 3. Predation; [P] 4. Competition; [P] 5. Disease; or [P] 6. Other natural occurrences or human-related activities."" (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(A).) The Commission may find a delisting warranted if the Commission finds the species' existence no longer threatened by any one or any combination of the same factors. (Id., subd. (i)(1)(B).)     2. Implied Exemption From CEQA     In addressing Kern County's contention that a delisting decision is impliedly exempt from CEQA due to an irreconcilable conflict between CESA and CEQA, we are first guided by the principle stated in Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at page 195, that where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be presumed unless a contrary legislative intent can be discerned. Nothing in the language or history of CEQA or CESA indicates the Legislature intended the Commission to be exempt from CEQA when carrying out its responsibilities under CESA. Accordingly, Kern County's argument must be rejected.     The Legislature has provided that certain projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA. (See  21080, subd. (b), 21084, subd. (a).) The Legislature did not expressly create a CEQA exemption for the Commission's actions under CESA. Nor does CESA include an express exemption from CEQA. It is evident, however, that the Legislature knows how to create such an exception when one is intended. (See, e.g., Health & Saf. Code,  44561, subd. (a) [bonds issued by pollution control, financing authority exempt from CEQA]; Wat. Code,  13389 [state and regional water boards exempted from preparing EIR prior to adopting waste discharge requirements]; cf.  Dunn-Edwards, supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 658-659  [nothing in Health and Safety Code evidencing legislative intent to repeal CEQA with respect to air districts].)     The Legislature amended CEQA in 1975 by adding section 21080.5, which allows state agencies with environmental responsibilities to use their own procedures for reviewing proposed projects in lieu of an EIR. If the Legislature had believed these agencies were exempt, the amendment would have been a needless act. (Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 195-196; cf. Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1230-1231 [relying on similar reasoning to reject argument that timber harvesting is exempt from CEQA];  Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, 616-617, 216 Cal. Rptr. 502  [same].)     CEQA further provides in section 21004, ""In mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a public project on the environment, a public agency may exercise only those express or implied powers provided by law other than [CEQA]. However, a public agency may use discretionary powers provided by such other law for the purpose of mitigating or avoiding a significant effect on the environment subject to the express or implied constraints or limitations that may be provided by law."" This provision strongly suggests the Legislature intended CEQA to apply to all public agencies undertaking discretionary projects and to the fullest extent possible, even if the agency's discretion to comply with all of CEQA's requirements may be constrained by the substantive provisions of the law governing the public agency. 1  Such an intent is inconsistent with Kern County's assertion that incompatibility between the Commission's species-focused determination to list or delist under CESA and the broader requirements of CEQA impliedly exempts the Commission's delisting decision from all of CEQA.           FN1  The dissent reads section 21004     solely as a limitation on the power provided by CEQA.     However, in making clear that provisions of CEQA may be     subject to the powers of the public agency, section 21004     also affirms the Legislature's intent that CEQA ""be used     in conjunction with discretionary powers granted to public     agencies by other laws."" (Guidelines,  15040, subd.     (a) [conforming the Guidelines to the statute's enactment     with clarifying interpretations].)       In its brief, amicus curiae Pacific Legal Foundation contends CESA exempts the Commission from the requirements of CEQA because ""a delisting decision under CESA is a nondiscretionary biological determination."" As previously noted, only discretionary projects are subject to CEQA. (  21080, subd. (a).) A nondiscretionary or ministerial project is exempt. (  21080, subd. (b)(1); Guidelines,  15268.) Thus, if the Commission's decision to delist a species is properly characterized as ministerial, it is exempt from CEQA. Contrary to Pacific Legal Foundation's view, however, the Commission's decision whether or not a delisting is warranted is discretionary within the meaning of CEQA.     The statutory distinction between discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional equivalent, environmental review would be a meaningless exercise. (Cf.  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 191 Cal. App. 3d at p. 267.)  Thus, ministerial projects ""involve little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out."" (Guidelines,  15369.) By contrast, a discretionary project is one which ""requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity."" (Guidelines,  15357; see  Miller v. City of Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 1118, 1138-1142  [applying these definitions to decide whether city's building permit process was subject to CEQA].)     The numerous statutory provisions and administrative regulations governing the listing and delisting process leave no doubt as to the discretionary nature of the Commission's delisting decision. (See, e.g., Fish & G. Code,  2074.2, 2075 [Commission shall consider petition]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(B) [species may be delisted if Commission determines its existence no longer threatened by enumerated factors].) The Commission itself appears to understand its determination whether or not a delisting is warranted to be a discretionary one. In the ""Notice of Findings"" made in connection with the delisting petition at issue here, the Commission stated that under the statutory requirements of CESA, it ""must not only consider all of the evidence introduced in the proceedings, but also must weigh and evaluate it -- that is, it must determine whether evidence received is scientifically credible, reasonable and reliable."" We note that commentators have characterized CESA's listing and delisting process as ""quasi-judicial,"" finding the Commission's ""wide discretion to make listing determinations similar to a judge's decision-making role in a courtroom. [Fn. omitted.]"" (Dwyer & Murphy, Fulfilling the Promise: Reconsidering and Reforming the California Endangered Species Act (1995) 35 Nat. Resources J. 735, 745; see also Kelly & D'Angelo, Near Extinction: California's Protection of Endangered Species (Spring/Summer 1990) 10 Cal. Regulatory L. Rptr. 1, 4, 9.)     The procedural facts of this case provide ample evidence of the Commission's exercise of discretion. Here, the Department evaluated the delisting petition to determine whether it contained sufficient scientific information to show the petitioned action may be warranted. The Department concluded the petition was deficient. The Commission declined to follow the Department's recommendation, however, and accepted the petition for consideration. The Department then prepared a comprehensive status review of the Mojave ground squirrel, concluding the delisting was not warranted because the species was likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. After conducting a public hearing on the delisting petition, the Commission voted to delist the Mojave ground squirrel.     Although the Commission is required to list or delist ""if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information . . ., that the action is warranted"" (Fish & G. Code,  2070), this standard is not so fixed and objective as to eliminate the need for judgment and deliberation on the Commission's part. Pacific Legal Foundation's characterization of a delisting decision as ""nondiscretionary"" cannot be reconciled with the truly discretionary nature of the Commission's statutory responsibilities under CESA, or the Commission's obvious exercise of discretion in this case.     Where a project involves elements of both ministerial and discretionary action, it is subject to CEQA. (Guidelines,  15268, subd. (d);  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 191 Cal. App. 3d at p. 271  [observing principle that CEQA applies even where agency's role is largely ministerial].) As previously discussed, the Legislature intended CEQA to apply to discretionary projects, even when the agency's discretion to fully comply with CEQA is constrained by the substantive laws governing its actions. Assuming the Commission's discretion to delist is constrained by CESA, the Commission is obligated nonetheless to comply with CEQA's environmental protection mandate to the greatest extent possible ""within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 8 Cal. 3d at p. 259.)      Our conclusion here that CEQA applies to the Commission's delisting decision is consistent with numerous decisions of this court and the Courts of Appeal rejecting assertions by state agencies that an incompatibility between their statutory directives and CEQA requirements exempts them from compliance with the latter. (See, e.g., Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at p. 1231 [timber harvesting under Forest Practice Act]; Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 198-201 [setting hunting seasons pursuant to Fish and Game Code];  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com., supra, 13 Cal. 3d at pp. 282-286  [Knox-Nisbet Act];  Environmental Protection Information Center v. Johnson, supra, 170 Cal. App. 3d at p. 620  [Forest Practice Act];  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 570, 138 Cal. Rptr. 241  [coastal commission permit issuance procedures].)     In further support of its argument that CESA's requirements for carrying out a delisting are irreconcilable with and therefore exempt from the requirements of CEQA, Kern County urges this court to adopt the reasoning of  Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus (1981) 657 F.2d 829  (hereafter Andrus). The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Andrus that the Secretary of the Interior was not required to file an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when making the decision to list a species under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). ( Id. at pp. 835-837.)  For a number of reasons, we decline to follow the reasoning of Andrus here.     First, Andrus does not present a strong case of statutory irreconcilability warranting an exemption from environmental review. As the United States Supreme Court's decision in Flint Ridge Dev. Co. v.  Scenic Rivers Assn. (1976) 426 U.S. 776, 49 L. Ed. 2d 205, 96 S. Ct. 2430  (hereafter Flint Ridge) strongly suggests, a federal agency is exempt from preparing an impact statement under NEPA only when there is a ""clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority."" ( Id. at p. 788.)      The question in  Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. 776,  was whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was required to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant to NEPA before allowing a statement of record filed by a real estate developer to become effective within 30 days after it was filed. Under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act  (15 U.S.C.  1701  et seq.), the Secretary of HUD has a duty to permit a statement of record to go into effect within 30 days unless the statement was inaccurate or incomplete. The Supreme Court recognized that it was impossible for the Secretary of HUD to prepare an impact statement prior to the date she was obligated to allow the disclosure statement to go into effect. Relying on language in NEPA requiring all federal agencies to comply with the impact statement requirement ""to the fullest extent possible"" (Flint Ridge,  supra, 426 U.S. at pp. 778-785),  the court concluded that ""where a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists, NEPA must give way."" ( Id. at p. 788.)  The court held even if the HUD Secretary's duty under the disclosure act to effectuate the disclosure statement constituted federal action significantly affecting the environment, an impact statement need not be prepared. ( Id. at p. 791.)      Andrus acknowledged that federal agencies are expected to comply with NEPA unless there is a statutory conflict that expressly prohibits or makes full compliance impossible. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 833.) It also recognized the ESA provisions at issue in the case did not create the type of statutory conflict with NEPA that existed in Flint Ridge, and did not suggest the preparation of an impact statement would conflict with the Interior Secretary's responsibilities under ESA. Nonetheless, Andrus distinguished Flint Ridge as a case involving time constraints and the necessity of expeditious action by a public agency. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 834.)     Such a narrow reading of Flint Ridge is questionable, however, in light of the high court's characterization of its inquiry as whether requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement ""would create an irreconcilable and fundamental conflict with the Secretary's duties"" under the statute at issue in the case. ( Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 788;  cf.  Jones v. Gordon (9th Cir. 1986) 792 F.2d 821, 825-826  [federal environmental agencies not exempt from NEPA absent clear and unavoidable statutory conflict].) Absent such a ""clear and fundamental conflict of statutory duty"" (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 791), the soundness of the Andrus court's holding exempting a listing under ESA from the impact statement requirements of NEPA is open to question.     Kern County argues nonetheless that because CEQA was modeled after NEPA, and CESA was modeled after ESA, Andrus presents a proper construction of CEQA and CESA. This court need not follow federal precedent, however, when the federal provisions cannot fairly be said to parallel ours. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 201-202.)  We find the federal statutes at issue in Andrus are different in significant respects from the statutory schemes at issue in this case. Thus, we find Andrus unpersuasive authority here.     In holding the Secretary of the Interior need not prepare an environmental impact statement before listing a species as endangered or threatened under ESA, the court in Andrus reasoned such a requirement would not serve the purposes of ESA or NEPA. (Andrus, supra, 675 F.2d at pp. 835-837.) The court found preparation of an impact statement for a listing would be a ""waste of time"" because the Secretary of the Interior has no authority to consider environmental impact when determining whether to list a species pursuant to ESA. (Id. at p. 836.) The court opined the legislative history of ESA suggests the Interior Secretary's duty to list was considered by Congress to be mandatory, not discretionary. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at pp. 838-839.) Additionally, the court viewed the requirement of an impact statement before listing a species as threatened or endangered as unnecessary because, by listing a species and thereby working to prevent the irretrievable loss of a natural resource, the Interior Secretary is furthering the environmental protection goals of NEPA. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 837.) The court found the legislative history of NEPA to suggest Congress did not intend to subject agencies dedicated to protecting the environment to the requirements of NEPA. ( Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838.)      The Andrus court's conclusion that the Interior Secretary need not prepare an impact statement before carrying out a listing also rested on the court's view that adding a species to the endangered species list itself furthers the purpose of NEPA, even in the absence of an impact statement. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835.) Andrus found in the legislative history of NEPA an indication that Congress did not intend NEPA to apply to federal agencies having environmental responsibilities. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838.) For several reasons, we find the reasoning in Andrus inapplicable here.     First, although Andrus's observation--that a listing serves the same environmental protection goals of NEPA--arguably supports the proposition that preparation of an EIR for a listing under CESA would be an unnecessary exercise, the same cannot be said with respect to a delisting. A delisting by definition withdraws existing environmental protections from the affected species. Unlike the arguably superfluous function served by an environmental impact statement in the listing decision at issue in Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at page 836, to require environmental review as part of the Commission's delisting decisionmaking process serves not to duplicate but to further the purposes of CEQA, by bringing to light the possible environmental consequences of the proposed removal of protections from the species. Moreover, the Andrus court's reliance on the legislative history of NEPA to support its view that NEPA was not intended to govern the actions of federal environmental agencies has no relevance to our inquiry here. The federal courts have fashioned a functional equivalent test to exempt certain activities of such federal agencies from NEPA requirements. (See, e.g.,  Portland Cement Association v. Ruckelshaus (D.C. Cir. 1973) 158 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 486 F.2d 375, 384-385;  Appalachian Power Co. v.  Environmental Pro. Agcy. (4th Cir. 1973) 477 F.2d 495, 508.)  However, our Legislature has provided in section 21080.5 an express limited exemption from CEQA for qualified state agencies having environmental responsibilities. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 201-202  [rejecting federal functional equivalent test in light of enactment of section 21080.5].) Thus, even if Andrus is correct that Congress did not intend NEPA to apply to federal environmental agencies, the enactment of section 21080.5 precludes the conclusion that the Legislature similarly intended to exempt from CEQA the state's public agencies charged with environmental responsibilities.     Unlike the Andrus court's determination that preparation of an impact statement for a listing under ESA would be a ""waste of time,"" (supra,  657 F.2d at p. 836)  we find a delisting decision under CESA that is made in accordance with CEQA would serve an important purpose in helping to shape and inform the Commission's exercise of discretion. The benefits and purposes of the CEQA process can be reconciled with the Commission's duty under CESA to make a species-focused determination when considering a petition for delisting. Indeed, we are obligated to harmonize the objectives common to both statutory schemes to the fullest extent the language of the statutes fairly permits. ( Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com., supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 274;   Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Arcata Nat. Corp. (1976) 59 Cal. App. 3d 959, 131 Cal. Rptr. 172  [harmonizing provisions of CEQA and Forest Practice Act];  Gallegos v. State Bd. of Forestry (1978) 76 Cal. App. 3d 945, 142 Cal. Rptr. 86  [same].)     As part of the CEQA review process, an agency that proposes to carry out a discretionary project must provide written responses to significant environmental objections prior to the agency's final decision. (Guidelines,  15132, subd. (d), 15362, subd. (b); cf.  Rural Landowners Assn. v. City Council (1983) 143 Cal. App. 3d 1013, 1020-1021, 192 Cal. Rptr. 325.)  Articulating its reasons for rejecting opposing views in written form while the delisting petition is still pending helps sharpen the Commission's understanding of the significant points raised in opposition to the petition. CEQA also requires the public agency to consider feasible alternatives to the project which would lessen any significant adverse environmental impact. (  21002, 21081;  City of Poway v. City of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal. App. 3d 1037, 1045-1046, 202 Cal. Rptr. 366,  hereafter City of Poway.) One alternative is ""no project."" (See Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(2) [""no project"" alternative to be considered along with proposed project's environmental impact];  Dusek v. Redevelopment Agency (1985) 173 Cal. App. 3d 1029, 1043, 219 Cal. Rptr. 346.)  CESA defines a ""threatened"" species as a species that ""although not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter."" (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) Thus, when making its delisting decision, the Commission considers the environmental impact of a delisting decision on the subject species. Presumably, the decision to delist is a determination that the withdrawal of CESA protections will not endanger the species in the future. However, the Commission could further benefit by considering a ""no project"" alternative under CEQA during the delisting process. A delisting decision made in conjunction with CEQA's focus on significant environmental effects will better ensure the delisting itself will not have future environmental consequences that endanger the subject species, and will help prevent expenditure of the Commission's time and resources on a petition seeking the relisting of a delisted species that suffered significant effects as a result of the withdrawal of CESA protections. Under CEQA, a public agency must also consider measures that might mitigate a project's adverse environmental impact, and adopt them if feasible. (  21002, 21081.) Because the decision to withdraw CESA protections from one species could affect other species and flora that share the same habitat, the development, consideration, and adoption of feasible mitigation measures enhance the overall species protection goals of CESA while encouraging a more environmentally sound delisting decision.     In light of the distinctions between CEQA and NEPA, between CESA and ESA, and between a delisting and a listing, and recognizing the utility of the CEQA process to a delisting decision under CESA, we conclude Andrus does not constitute persuasive authority for exempting a delisting decision under CESA from the requirements of CEQA on the basis of an irreconcilable statutory conflict.     B. Is The Commission's Delisting Decision Otherwise Exempt From CEQA? (The Categorical Exemption)     Kern County and the Commission claim the Commission's delisting action was categorically exempt from CEQA. The Court of Appeal correctly rejected a similar contention.     The Legislature has directed the Secretary to promulgate a list of classes of projects that have no significant effect on the environment. (  21084; Guidelines,  15300 et seq. [29 classes of categorical exemptions].) A project falling within such a categorical exemption is not subject to CEQA. ( No Oil, supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 74;  Dunn-Edwards,  supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at p. 656;   Association for Protection etc. Values v. City of Ukiah (1991) 2 Cal. App. 4th 720, 725-726.)      The Commission's invocation of a categorical exemption was in error for several reasons. First, a categorical exemption represents a determination by the Secretary that a particular project does not have a significant effect on the environment. (  21084.) It follows that an activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt. (Cf. Guidelines,  15061, subd. (b)(3) [CEQA applies only to projects having potential for causing significant effect on environment; where no possibility that activity will have significant effect, activity not subject to CEQA].) As the interplay between the Commission's regulations and the Guidelines makes clear, the removal of a species from the endangered or threatened species list is an activity that may have a significant effect on the environment. A delisting therefore cannot be categorically exempt.     Under CEQA, an agency contemplating an action having ""the potential to . . . reduce the . . . number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species"" (Guidelines,  15065, subd. (a)) must find that the project ""may have a significant effect on the environment"" (Guidelines,  15065), and a species that is currently listed as endangered or threatened under CESA is a ""rare or endangered"" animal or plant for such purposes. (Guidelines,  15380.) Under the Commission's regulations governing the review of listing and delisting petitions, a threatened or endangered species that is the subject of a delisting petition retains its protected status throughout the delisting process. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(B)(1).) Because the removal of a species from the endangered or threatened list withdraws existing levels of protection, a delisting creates at least the potential for population reduction or habitat restriction. Thus, the Commission is obligated to find a delisting may have a significant environmental effect. Such a finding precludes invocation of a categorical exemption. (Cf.  Dunn-Edwards, supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 656-658  [holding categorical exemption inapplicable where adoption of regulations tightening emission standards for architectural solvents will result in adverse environmental effects];  International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App. 3d 265, 276, 171 Cal. Rptr. 875  [same with regard to relaxation of air quality standards].)     The record indicates the Commission claimed the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was categorically exempt because it was within the class of ""actions taken by regulatory agencies as authorized by state law or local ordinance to assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment."" (Guidelines,  15307; id.,  15308.) Contrary to the Commission's claim of a categorical exemption, however, a delisting action cannot be fairly included within this class of projects. Exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. ( Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal. App. 3d 827, 842, 171 Cal. Rptr. 753.)      The delisting of a species withdraws a number of statutory protections. For example, CESA establishes a policy adding significant weight to the CEQA balancing scale on the side favoring protection of a listed species over projects that might jeopardize them or their habitats. (Fish & G. Code,  2053.) With limited exceptions, CESA prohibits the taking, importation, possession, sale, or purchase of any endangered or threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2080.) CESA also requires state agencies to consult with the Department to ensure that the agency's action is not likely to ""jeopardize"" the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. A finding of jeopardy requires ""reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with conserving the species which would prevent jeopardy."" (Fish & G. Code,  2092, subd. (a).) Because a delisting removes rather than secures these protections, the categorical exemption for actions assuring the maintenance, preservation or enhancement of a natural resource set forth in sections 15307 and 15308 of the Guidelines does not apply. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 204-206  [categorical exemption for activities assuring maintenance, preservation, or enhancement of natural resource inapplicable to setting of hunting and fishing seasons];  International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 116 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 275-276  [exemption inapplicable to agency action leading to relaxation of air quality standards relating to allowable levels of nitrogen oxide emissions].)     Kern County argues that a delisting should not be viewed as an isolated action, but rather as an integral part of the entire statutory scheme of CESA. The county posits that because a delisting is merely part of the overall CESA process, and because this process provides for the maintenance, restoration or enhancement of the species, a delisting under CESA is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to the relevant Guidelines.     It is apparent that CESA contemplates delistings as an integral part of the entire statutory scheme. Ideally, the delisting of a species signals the successful restoration of a previously endangered or threatened population. Nonetheless, it is significant that CESA does not impose a requirement for species recovery planning as part of the overall statutory scheme. Although the Department is required to conduct a status review of each of the listed species and report its findings and recommendations for species recovery to the Commission (Fish & G. Code,  2074.6), CESA does not require the implementation of recommendations. For this reason, contrary to the County's argument, it is more appropriate to view the Commission's delisting action as an activity separate from the Commission's consideration of whether or not to provide CESA protections by adding a candidate species to the endangered or threatened species list. Because a delisting involves the removal of, rather than the provision for, the statutory protections of CESA, it cannot be characterized as an action taken to ""assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource."" (Guidelines,  15307; id.,  15308.)     C. The Certified Regulatory Program     The Court of Appeal in this case determined the Commission's delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was not exempt from CEQA. It also concluded the Commission had to prepare and certify an EIR before removing a species from the threatened species list. In the court's view, the CESA procedures for adding or removing species from the endangered or threatened species list do not qualify as a certified regulatory program providing the functional equivalent of an EIR. The Court of Appeal also found the Commission's existing certified regulatory program limited to the establishment of hunting and fishing seasons and the related issuance of licenses. We do not agree.     1. The Scope Of The Certified Regulatory Program     As previously noted, section 21080.5 establishes a limited exemption from CEQA's EIR requirements for qualifying state agencies having environmental protection responsibilities. An agency that carries out its discretionary activities according to a regulatory program requiring an environmental plan or document may submit such a document in lieu of an EIR if the Secretary has certified that the regulatory program meets certain statutory criteria. (  21080.5, subds. (a), (d), (e).) For example, an agency seeking certification must adopt regulations requiring that final action on the proposed activity include written responses to significant environmental points raised during the decisionmaking process. (  21080.5, subd. (b)(2)(iv).) The agency must also implement guidelines for evaluating the proposed activity consistently with the environmental protection purposes of the regulatory program. (  21080.5, subd. (b)(2)(ii).) The document generated pursuant to the agency's regulatory program must include alternatives to the proposed project and mitigation measures to minimize significant adverse environmental effects (  21080.5, subd. (b)(3)(i)), and be made available for review by other public agencies and the public (  21080.5, subd. (b)(3)(ii)).     The CEQA Guidelines list the certified regulatory programs that the Secretary has determined meet all of the statutory criteria for exemption from EIR preparation set forth in section 21080.5. (Guidelines,  15251.) Among the programs on this list is ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b).)     The Commission's regulatory program was certified by the Secretary in 1976, shortly after this court's decision in Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d 190. The court held in Wildlife Alive that in light of the Legislature's then-recent enactment of section 21080.5 creating an express statutory exemption from EIR requirements for qualifying state agencies, the Commission could not claim an implied exemption from CEQA when setting bear hunting season dates and issuing hunting permits. (Id. at pp. 195-198.)     The procedures adopted by the Commission in 1976 and submitted to the Secretary for certification of its regulatory program pursuant to section 21080.5 first appeared as section 3.90 of title 14 of the former California Administrative Code (now California Code of Regulations). In 1982, the section was renumbered section 781.5, without any change in the language. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5; all further citations to title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 781.5 will be referred to as Regulatory Program.) The provisions comprising the regulatory program are worded broadly, and, by their terms, apply to the Commission's varied regulatory responsibilities under the Fish and Game Code.     The Commission's review procedures adopted for certification pursuant to section 21080.5 are applicable when the Commission is called on to consider recommendations by the Department regarding the adoption of regulations ""which may have a significant effect on the environment, or it is anticipated that a substantial body of opinion will reasonably consider the environmental effect to be adverse."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (a).) For the following reasons, we conclude a delisting under CESA falls within the express terms of subdivision (a), triggering the review procedures established in the regulatory program. First, the delisting process requires the Department to make recommendations to the Commission regarding petitions for delisting. (Fish & G. Code,  2073.5; see also Fish & G. Code,  2072.7 [in absence of petition, Department may make recommendation regarding removal] of species from endangered or threatened list].) Second, a delisting under CESA requires the adoption of a regulation. In order for a listing or delisting to be effective, the Commission must amend its regulations listing endangered and threatened species. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.2 [list of endangered, threatened plants]; id.,  670.5 [animals].) Finally, and as previously discussed, a proposal regarding the removal of existing CESA protections for a species on the endangered or threatened species list concerns the adoption of a regulation ""which may have a significant effect on the environment."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (a).)     Mountain Lion contends the Commission's certified regulatory program does not contemplate a delisting decision under CESA because CESA was enacted in 1984, subsequent to the Secretary's certification in 1976. However, the fact CESA was adopted after the Secretary's certification does not foreclose application of the procedures comprising the Commission's existing certified regulatory program to a delisting decision. To the contrary, it appears the Legislature intended a state agency's certified regulatory program to remain in force notwithstanding subsequent additions and amendments to the program, unless and until the Secretary withdraws the certification.     Section 21080.5, subdivisions (e) and (f) govern the possible effect of subsequent changes in a state agency's regulatory program following certification by the Secretary. Subdivision (e) grants the Secretary authority to certify a regulatory program, and to withdraw such certification after determining that the regulatory program has been altered so that it no longer meets the certification criteria. Subdivision (f) of section 21080.5 provides that once a regulatory program has been certified, ""any proposed change in the program which could affect compliance with the qualifications for certification"" may be submitted to the Secretary for review and comment. (  21080.5, subd. (f).) If the agency decides to submit a proposed change, the Secretary determines ""whether the proposed change will alter the regulatory program so that it no longer meets the qualification for certification . . . and will result in a withdrawal of certification as provided in this section."" (Ibid.)     In enacting these provisions, the Legislature appears to have contemplated that once certification occurs, alterations in the regulatory program through statutory amendment or regulatory change will not affect the program's continued vitality unless and until the Secretary withdraws certification. If the Secretary has not made the determination that changes in the regulatory program affect the qualifications for certification, a state agency acting pursuant to later-enacted amendments to its regulatory program may continue to generate an environmental document in accordance with its own procedures in lieu of preparing and certifying an EIR.     Mountain Lion did not seek in its petition for writ of mandate an order directing the Secretary to withdraw certification of the Commission's regulatory program on the ground it had been impermissibly altered by the enactment of CESA. Nor does it raise such a claim here. Because the statutory directives of CESA do not compromise any of the criteria for certification of the Commission's regulatory program, the Commission may properly utilize the review procedures of its certified regulatory program when proceeding under CESA. (Cf.  Laupheimer v. State of California (1988) 200 Cal. App. 3d 440, 459-460, 246 Cal. Rptr. 82  [Department of Forestry need not have resubmitted timber harvesting plan procedures to Secretary when statutory amendments to Forest Practice Act made after certification of regulatory program did not affect certification qualifications].)     Moreover, Mountain Lion points to nothing that suggests the Legislature intended the Commission to refrain from applying the review procedures of its existing certified regulatory program to a delisting decision. We may presume that when it enacted CESA the Legislature was aware of the regulations adopted to satisfy the requirements of certification pursuant to section 21080.5. (Cf.  Moore v. California State Bd. of Accountancy (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 999, 1017-1018, 831 P.2d 798.)  Indeed, as we concluded (ante, at pp. 19-20), the review procedures established by the Commission for certification of its regulatory program both complement and enhance the statutory framework of CESA. For these reasons, and notwithstanding the fact that CESA was enacted after the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program in 1976, we conclude the Commission is entitled to an exemption from the EIR process as provided in section 21080.5 by adhering to its certified regulatory program when carrying out a delisting under CESA.     This conclusion is consistent with the Commission's conduct prior to the litigation in this case. In a document entitled ""Notice of Determination,"" dated September 7, 1993, the Commission's executive director certified that the Commission found the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was ""taken in compliance with [the Commission's regulatory program] and Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code . . . ."" Although the Commission's further declaration the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel ""will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment"" was in error, as previously discussed, the Commission's asserted consideration of the possible environmental effects of the delisting decision under the auspices of its certified regulatory program and section 21080.5 provides strong evidence that the Commission can comply with CEQA to the fullest possible extent when evaluating a delisting petition.     As previously noted, the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program is expressed in broad terms as ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b).) Notwithstanding the broadly worded certification, the Court of Appeal concluded the procedures for generating a substitute environmental document did not apply to a delisting under CESA because the certified regulatory program governed only the Commission's establishment of hunting and fishing seasons and issuance of licenses. For several reasons, we disagree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion.     In describing the Commission's certified regulatory program, the Secretary did not qualify or limit its scope to hunting and fishing regulations. The Secretary clearly had the ability and authority to do so, however. In a number of instances, the Secretary has certified a regulatory program that is narrowly defined and restrictive in scope. For example, the Secretary has certified ""that portion of the regulatory program of the Air Resources Board which involves the adoption, approval, amendment, or repeal of standards, rules, regulations, or plans to be used in the regulatory program for the protection and enhancement of ambient air quality."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (d); see also id.,  15251, subds. (a) [certifying regulation of timber harvesting operations pursuant to chapter 8, commencing with section 4511, of part 2 of division 4 of the Public Resources Code], (i) [certifying pesticide regulatory program administered by the Food and Agriculture Department and county agricultural commissioners].)     The Court of Appeal relied on several references to the Commission's regulation of hunting seasons and hunting and fishing licenses in the Secretary's 1976 statement of findings for its conclusion that the regulatory program includes only the setting of hunting and fishing seasons and issuance of licenses. The references do not support its conclusion.     When the Commission sought certification of its regulatory program in 1976, the newly enacted statutory exemption only applied to the regulatory programs of state agencies involved in ""the issuance to a person . . . of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use."" (  21080.5, added by Stats. 1975, ch. 1187,  1, p. 2931.) In his statement of findings certifying that the Commission's regulatory program complied with the requirements of section 21080.5, the Secretary identified former California Administrative Code, title 14, section 3.90 (now Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5) as the certified regulatory program. The Secretary noted the regulations adopted by the Commission and set forth in former section 3.90 did not directly involve licensing. Nonetheless, the Secretary found the Commission's regulatory program met the criteria of section 21080.5 because there was a necessary relationship between the Commission's regulation of hunting and fishing and the issuance of licenses by the Department of Fish and Game.     Contrary to the Court of Appeal's conclusion, the Secretary's reference to hunting seasons does not demonstrate that the intended scope of the regulatory program is limited to licensing. It shows only that the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program was carried out within the scope of his then-existing authority. In order for the Commission's regulatory program to comply with the criteria set forth in section 21080.5, the program had to involve ""the issuance . . . of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use."" (  21080.5, subd. (b)(1).) Under the Fish and Game Code, the issuance of licenses is the responsibility of the Department, not the Commission. The Secretary's reference to the setting of hunting and fishing seasons was made to establish the necessary linkage between the Commission's discretionary regulatory responsibilities and the requirement of section 21080.5, as it then existed. At that time, the certification of a program other than one involving licenses would have exceeded the scope of the Secretary's authority.       Approximately one year after the Secretary's certification of ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code"" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b)), section 21080.5 was amended to include regulatory programs involving ""the adoption or approval of standards, rules, regulations or plans for use in the regulatory program."" (Stats. 1977, ch. 1200,  6.5, p. 3999.) As commentators have observed, it is the language of section 21080.5 and the terms of the agency's certification that determine the scope of the activities entitled to an exemption from the EIR requirements. (Remy et al., Guide to the California Environmental Quality Act (1993 ed.) p. 86; cf. Citizens, supra, 187 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1584-1585 [amendment to section 21080.5 made that section applicable to pesticide regulatory program even though original certification by Secretary occurred prior to amendment].)     2. Compliance With The Requirements Of The Certified Regulatory Program     In order to claim the exemption from CEQA's EIR requirements, an agency must demonstrate strict compliance with its certified regulatory program. (Section 21080.5, subd. (a); Citizens, supra, 187 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1586;  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com., supra, 69 Cal. App. 3d at p. 581.)  We must therefore determine whether the Commission followed its own procedures. For the reasons that follow, we conclude it did not.     Kern County argues we must presume official duty is regularly performed. (Evid. Code,  664.) However, such a presumption is misplaced in a case like this where the record affirmatively shows the Commission failed to satisfy every requirement of its certified regulatory program. (Cf.  City of Sacramento v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, 2 Cal. App. 4th at p. 976  [regular performance of official duty presumed in absence of contrary evidence]; see also  Schaeffer Land Trust v. San Jose City Council (1989) 215 Cal. App. 3d 612, 622, 263 Cal. Rptr. 813  [appellate court conducts independent review of record to determine whether public agency followed mandatory procedures in arriving at its decision].)     The record indicates the Commission believed a delisting action was categorically exempt from CEQA. As the Commission's executive director told persons attending the Commission's June 17, 1993, public meeting, ""in the normal proceedings of listing a species as threatened or endangered, the Commission reserves its actions regarding a CEQA determination until the actual listing of that species. Based on legal advice from the Attorney General's office, we'll follow the same format in delisting and so we will be making a CEQA determination . . . . when we actually take the regulatory action to delist the Mojave ground squirrel. . . ."" Thereafter, the Commission filed a notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research claiming a categorical exemption from CEQA. The record makes clear the Commission proceeded with the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel as if the delisting was categorically exempt from CEQA. It follows that the Commission did not faithfully follow the procedures of its certified regulatory program when evaluating the delisting petition.     The record confirms the Commission's failure to satisfy these procedural requirements in several respects. First, the Commission did not respond to significant environmental opposition. The Commission's regulations require that written responses to comments be prepared prior to the final public meeting. Responses to comments received at the final meeting may be made orally by the Commission during the meeting. The oral responses are included in the official written minutes of the meeting. (Regulatory Program, subd. (h); see also  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(iv) [written response requirement].)     The Commission received numerous letters and heard testimony raising significant environmental concerns during the petition evaluation process. However, the Commission neither received nor responded on the record to public comments during its final meeting on the delisting proposal. Nor did the Commission prepare written responses to significant environmental objections prior to issuing its final notice of regulatory change removing the Mojave ground squirrel from the threatened species list.     The record shows that, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, the Commission submitted its rulemaking file delisting the Mojave ground squirrel to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for approval. The OAL disapproved the Commission's regulatory action because the Commission's final statement of reasons failed to include a summary and response to public comments, in violation of former Government Code section 11346.7, subdivision (b)(3) (now see Gov. Code,  11346.2, 11346.9). In response to the OAL's decision, the Commission submitted an addendum to the final statement of purpose of its regulatory action, summarizing and responding to points raised during the petition review process.     Many of the Commission's responses to public comment included in the addendum address significant environmental points raised during the Commission's review of the delisting petition. However, these responses were clearly made to cure a Government Code deficiency in the regulatory action delisting the ground squirrel, and not in order to comply with the requirements of the Commission's certified regulatory program.     The Commission's post-decisionmaking responses to significant environmental concerns do not satisfy the written response component of its certified regulatory program. Nor do they comply with the spirit of this requirement. The written response requirement ensures that members of the Commission will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences. (Cf.  Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 122 Cal. App. 3d 813, 820, 176 Cal. Rptr. 342;   Rural Landowners Assn. v. City Council, supra, 143 Cal. App. 3d 1013, 1020-1021.)  It also promotes the policy of citizen input underlying CEQA. ( People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal. App. 3d 830, 841, 115 Cal. Rptr. 67.)  When the written responses are prepared and issued after a decision has been made, however, the purpose served by such a requirement cannot be achieved.     In addition to the failure to comply with the written response requirement of its certified regulatory program, the Commission did not satisfy the program's directive to assess feasible project alternatives and mitigation measures. The Commission's review procedures prohibit the Commission from adopting proposed regulations ""if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen any significant adverse impact which the activity may have on the environment, unless specific economic, social or other conditions make infeasible such project alternatives or such mitigation measures."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (g); see  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(i) [feasibility requirement].)     The Commission's regulation tracks the language of section 21002, one of the substantive provisions of CEQA which the Commission is required to carry out even when operating pursuant to its certified regulatory program. (Guidelines,  15250; Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1230-1231;  Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson, supra, 170 Cal. App. 3d at p. 617.)  Thus, if the Commission satisfies its CEQA obligation to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects whenever feasible, it has also complied with the corresponding provision in its certified regulatory program.     CEQA's substantive mandate that public agencies refrain from approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures is effectuated in section 21081. (See  City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1045-1046.)  Under this provision, a decisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures. (  21081; see also  Environmental Council v. Board of Supervisors (1982) 135 Cal. App. 3d 428, 439, 185 Cal. Rptr. 363.)  The requirement ensures there is evidence of the public agency's actual consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures, and reveals to citizens the analytical process by which the public agency arrived at its decision. ( Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta (1988) 198 Cal. App. 3d 433, 440-441, 243 Cal. Rptr. 727;  City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1046;  Resource Defense Fund v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d 886, 896, 236 Cal. Rptr. 794.)  Under CEQA, the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that, notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures. (City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1046.) The record in this case indicates the Commission has failed to meet this burden.     There is no evidence in the record the Commission evaluated feasible mitigation measures during its review of the petition to delist the Mojave ground squirrel. The Commission contends consideration of mitigation measures was unnecessary because a finding that the delisting was warranted under CESA is the equivalent of finding that the delisting would not have a significant, adverse impact on the ground squirrel. The contention has merit. Under CESA, a ""threatened"" species is a species that although not presently threatened with extinction is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future in the absence of CESA protections. (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) Presumably, the removal of a species from the threatened species list would not be ""warranted"" within the meaning of CESA if to do so was likely to endanger the species in the future. (See Fish & G. Code,  2070 [Commission shall add or remove species from endangered or threatened list when warranted by sufficient scientific information].) The consideration of mitigation measures to minimize identifiable adverse effects on the candidate species is thus not only unnecessary under CEQA, but would appear to be improper under CESA's substantive provisions. (Cf.  Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino, supra, 202 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 308-309  [use permit condition requiring compliance with environmental regulations is proper mitigating measure because compliance avoids potentially significant environmental effects].)     At the same time, however, the delisting decision does not represent a finding with regard to the possible significant effects of a delisting on the environment generally. (Cf.  21060.5 [defining ""environment"" broadly as physical conditions which exist within area affected by a proposed project including land, air, water, flora, fauna, etc.].) Because the ground squirrel shares its habitat with other species of plants and animals, some of which are not protected by CESA, it is possible the removal of protections from the one species will have a significant, adverse effect on others. Carrying out a delisting in accordance with CESA thus does not eliminate the need for the Commission to consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures that would lessen or avoid the identified significant environmental impacts of the delisting. As suggested by analysis in the Department's status report in this case, the Commission has the authority to implement a variety of measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a delisting, such as ordering the Department to place affected species on its list of birds and mammals of special concern for further study and observation.     As to CEQA's requirement that public agencies consider project alternatives, the Commission points out that CESA mandates the Commission either grant or deny the delisting petition based on the evidence before it, thereby precluding the Commission from considering or adopting any other alternatives. We find the Commission's point well taken in light of CESA's substantive provisions governing the listing and delisting of species. However, CEQA contemplates a ""no project"" alternative. (Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(4).) Thus, CEQA's substantive requirement that the public agency consider feasible project alternatives can be used in conjunction with CESA.     The Commission further argues the record demonstrates the Commission satisfied CEQA's alternatives requirement. We disagree. When the Commission accepted Kern County's petition to delist the Mojave ground squirrel, the Department prepared a report to the Commission reviewing the status of the Mojave ground squirrel and recommending the petitioned action should not be taken. (See Fish & G. Code,  2074.6.) In its status review, the Department indicated a concern that by delisting the species, the habitat of the Mojave ground squirrel would continue to be destroyed, fragmented, and degraded. The Department was of the view that removing the ground squirrel from the list of threatened species would withdraw not only the protections of CESA, but also the special consideration for the species under CEQA's project-review process, and under the multiagency West Mojave coordinated management plan. The Department urged that the only alternative to the proposed regulatory action that would provide the protections equivalent to those of CESA was the continued listing of the ground squirrel as a threatened species under CESA.     The only evidence in the record of the Commission's consideration of this alternative to the proposed delisting appears in its ""Final Statement of Purpose for Regulatory Action,"" a document prepared after the Commission had determined it would approve the delisting petition and had proceeded to amend its regulations to remove the ground squirrel from the threatened species list. The Commission asserted that to make no change in its regulations with respect to the ground squirrel would be ""inconsistent with Commission findings."" It stated further, without elaboration, that ""no alternative considered by the Department would be more effective in carrying out the purposes for which the regulation is proposed or would be as effective and less burdensome to the affected private persons than the proposed regulation.""     The Commission's cursory rejection of the alternative to the proposed delisting does not constitute an adequate assessment of alternatives as required under CEQA and the Commission's certified regulatory program. Although the Commission's evaluation and rejection of the Department's recommendation to retain the ground squirrel on the threatened species list need not be exhaustive, it must reasonably reflect that due consideration was given to this alternative. The Commission's rejection of the proposed alternative as ""inconsistent with the Commission's findings"" fails to provide solid evidence of a meaningful review of the project alternative that would avoid the significant environmental effects identified by the Department. (Cf.  Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 30, 44, 271 Cal. Rptr. 393  [resolution adopted by council evidences the agency's careful consideration and rejection as unfeasible numerous project alternatives];  Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage v. City and County of San Francisco (1980) 106 Cal. App. 3d 893, 913-914, 165 Cal. Rptr. 401  [CEQA's findings requirement satisfied where Board provided nine different bases for its finding of no feasible alternative to project].)     We conclude the Commission failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and its own regulatory program when it removed the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species without responding in writing to significant environmental opposition and without meaningful consideration of the ""no project"" alternative. Because it did not proceed in accordance with procedures mandated by law, the Commission abused its discretion in delisting the species. (Code Civ. Proc.,  1094.5, subd. (b); cf. Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1235-1237 [failure to proceed in accordance with law presumptively prejudicial when mandatory procedures not followed].)     III. Disposition     The judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the Commission to set aside the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel is affirmed.       DISSENT:BY BAXTER, J.     I respectfully dissent. The California Endangered Species Act (CESA; Fish & G. Code,  2050 et seq.) states the exact procedures and criteria by which the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) is to decide whether individual plant or animal varieties shall appear, or continue to appear, on California's ""threatened"" and ""endangered"" species lists. A species must be listed if ""sufficient scientific information"" persuades the Commission that the species' continued existence is endangered or threatened. Once listed, a species must be removed from the list (delisted), if the Commission determines, from similar ""scientific information,"" that the species faces no imminent or likely threat or danger. The decision requires a detailed study and report by an expert agency, public notice, hearing, and comment, and full and formal findings by the Commission. But the process, while careful and public, is narrowly focused; the determination to list or delist must be based solely upon the ecological health of the species under consideration.     After protracted proceedings under CESA, the Commission found that the Mojave ground squirrel does not meet CESA's standards of threat or endangerment. The Commission explained that the squirrel was originally listed as ""rare,"" with little evidentiary support, under a predecessor statute, and thus automatically appeared on CESA's ""endangered"" list without further evaluation of its true status. Moreover, the Commission noted, while reliable estimates of the squirrel's population remain unavailable (and probably impossible), this species ranges throughout a desert habitat of almost 5 million acres, which is largely under public control and faces no significant development. Nor, the Commission concluded, was there evidence of the squirrel's decimation by disease, predation, exploitation, competition, or other natural occurrences or human activity. Accordingly, the Commission determined to delist the squirrel. On administrative mandamus, the superior court upheld the Commission's decision.     However, the majority, like the Court of Appeal, are not content with the workings of CESA's logical, complete, self-contained, and environmentally specific scheme. Instead, they conclude that the Commission's action to delist the Mojave ground squirrel under CESA is invalid because the Commission did not also follow the separate and distinct criteria and procedures of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code,  21000 et seq.), including CEQA's requirement that an environmental impact report (EIR) or its functional equivalent be prepared and considered.     But by its express terms and design, CEQA forces an agency to address and accommodate broad competing values -- environmental, social, and economic -- that contradict the narrow focus CESA requires the Commission to take when deciding whether to list or delist a threatened or endangered species. Where the issues considered under both statutes are the same, separate compliance with CEQA is a meaningless and wasteful duplication of CESA's own extensive provisions for full scrutiny and informed public participation. Thus, as two recent federal decisions concluded in the context of analogous federal laws, CEQA has no sensible place in such a proceeding.     For these reasons, I cannot join the majority's strained effort to fit a square peg into a round hole. I conclude that CEQA's EIR and procedural requirements cannot be reconciled with the particular statutes the Commission must apply when listing or ""delisting"" a threatened or endangered species. In my view, the Commission thus violated no law when it delisted the Mojave ground squirrel but failed to follow CEQA's procedures in addition to CESA's. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal.     I.     The focused purposes of CESA are made clear by its codified findings and policy declarations. These express concern about species of fish, wildlife, and plants that are ""in danger of, or threatened with, extinction"" because of overexploitation, destruction of habitat, disease, predation, and other factors. (Fish & G. Code,  2051, subd. (b).) CESA thus makes it the state's policy to ""conserve, protect, restore, and enhance"" all ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" species and their habitats. (Id.,  2052.)     Once a species is identified as endangered or threatened, it is entitled to a number of statutory protections. For example, with limited exceptions, CESA forbids the import, export, taking, possession, purchase, or sale of endangered or threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2080.) State agencies should not approve projects which jeopardize endangered or threatened species unless specific economic, social, or other conditions make other alternatives infeasible. (Id.,  2053, 2054, 2092, subd. (a).) Agencies should use their authority to conserve endangered and threatened species. (Id.,  2055.)     However, the initial determination whether a species qualifies for these protections by virtue of its threatened or endangered status is more narrowly circumscribed. Under CESA, the Commission must maintain a list of threatened and endangered species (Fish & G. Code,  2070), which are defined by the statute. A species of fish, plant, or wildlife is ""endangered"" if it is ""in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range due to one or more causes, including loss of habitat, change in habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or disease."" (Id.,  2062.) A species is ""threatened"" if it is ""likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter."" (Id.,  2067.) The Commission ""shall add or remove a species from either [the ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" species] list if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information pursuant to this article, that the action is warranted."" (Id.,  2070, italics added.) The Commission is to adopt ""criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened."" (Id.,  2071.5.)     Pursuant to section 2071.5 of the Fish and Game Code, the Commission has promulgated guidelines which further address the standards by which a determination to list or delist should be made. These guidelines closely track the statutory definitions of ""endangered"" and ""threatened"" species. Under the guidelines, a species ""shall be listed as endangered or threatened . . . if the Commission determines that its continued existence is in serious danger or is threatened by any one or any combination of the following factors: [P] 1. Present or threatened modification or destruction of its habitat; [P] 2. Overexploitation; [P] 3. Predation; [P] 4. Competition; [P] 5. Disease; or [P] 6. Other natural occurrences or human-related activities."" (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(A).) ""A species may be delisted . . . if the Commission determines that its continued existence is no longer threatened by any one or any combination of the factors provided in subsection (i)(1)(A) . . . ."" (Id., subd. (i)(1)(B).) 2            FN2  Contrary to the majority's     implication, the word ""may"" in this latter sentence     simply confirms that the Commission is not required to     maintain the species on the list despite a finding that no     further threat or danger exists. Indeed, the governing     statute (Fish & G. Code,  2070) makes delisting     mandatory when the Commission finds a listed species subject     to no current threat or danger. Hence, the guideline's     wording cannot be construed as authorizing the Commission to     decline to delist even if it makes such a finding.        CESA also provides detailed procedures for the Commission's decision to list or delist a species. Listing or delisting may be triggered by the petition of an ""interested person,"" or by a recommendation from the Department of Fish and Game (Department) itself. (Fish & G. Code,  2072.3, 2072.7.) After a noticed hearing, the Commission may reject, without further consideration, any petition or recommendation which does not include sufficient ""scientific information"" that the action recommended is ""warranted."" (Id.,  2074, 2074.2 (subd. (a)(1).) If the Commission ""accepts"" the petition or recommendation for further consideration (id.,  2074.2, subd. (a)(2)), the Department must review the status of the subject species, and must provide an expert written report to the Commission. (Id.,  2074.6.) This report, which shall be ""based upon the best scientific evidence available to the Department,"" must ""indicate[] whether the petitioned action is warranted,"" must include ""a preliminary identification of the habitat that may be essential to the continued existence of the species,"" and must ""recommend[] management activities or other recommendations for the recovery of the species."" (Ibid.) The Department's report is supplemented by the public solicitation of ""data and comments . . . from as many persons as is practicable."" (Id.,  2074.4; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (h).)     At a further noticed hearing, and after receipt of written and oral comment, the Commission must then make a ""finding[]"" whether the action of listing or delisting is warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2075, 2075.5.) Before this ""finding[]"" can be implemented as a formal rule, the Commission must also comply with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. (APA; Gov. Code,  11340 et seq.) These call for public notice, comment, and hearing, as well as a written statement of reasons with response to public recommendations and objections, as specified by the APA. (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5, subd. (2); see Gov. Code,  11346.2, subd. (b); 11346.4, subd. (a), 11346.8, subd. (a); 11346.9, subd. (a).)     Thus, in a CESA list/delist proceeding, the Commission is to determine only whether a species meets the statutory and regulatory standards of threat or endangerment. 2  The criteria, documents, and procedures by which CESA requires the Commission to make this decision are expressly detailed in CESA, and are tailored to ensure that the Commission's narrow discretion will be carefully and publicly exercised.            FN2  Noting the essentially     ""evidentiary and fact-finding"" nature of the     Commission's authority in a CESA list/delist proceeding, one     recent Court of Appeal decision characterized the     Commission's action as ""quasi-adjudicatory."" ( Natural     Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com. (1994) 28     Cal. App. 4th 1104, 1116, 1120.)        On the other hand, CEQA, the state's primary environmental legislation, is concerned with all the environmental effects of a ""project"" contemplated by a public agency, i.e., any unexempted agency activity that may have a significant adverse environmental effect. (Pub. Resources Code,  21000, 21001, 21065.) CEQA requires agencies, by formal findings, to avoid or mitigate the adverse environmental effects of such activities and decisions to the extent made feasible by economic, social, or other conditions. (Id.,  21002, 21002.1, subd. (b), 21081.)     Unless an exemption applies, an agency must issue a ""negative declaration,"" or must prepare and consider an EIR, before undertaking any ""project."" (Pub. Resources Code,  21080, subds. (c), (d).) The EIR requirement is intended to induce environmentally sensitive agency decisions by ""identifying the significant effects on the environment of a project, . . . identifying alternatives to the project, and . . . indicating the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."" (Id.,  21002.1, subd. (a).)     An EIR, where required, must detail ""all"" the significant environmental effects of the ""project,"" specifically including its impact on inducing development of land and human population growth, must disclose ""any"" significant unavoidable effect of the project on the environment, and must list alternatives or mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate these effects. (Pub. Resources Code,  21100, 21100.1.) A ""project"" may be not be approved if less damaging alternatives or mitigation measures are available, except where ""specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such . . . alternatives or . . . mitigation measures."" (Id.,  21002.)     Similar standards apply to a ""project"" which, though subject to CEQA in general, is exempted by CEQA itself from the EIR requirement under the auspices of a ""certified"" environmental ""regulatory program."" To be eligible for ""certification,"" such a ""regulatory program"" must, among other things, provide for full environmental consideration under CEQA's standards, pursuant to documentation and procedures which are the functional equivalent of the EIR process. Under the current statutory provisions, the program must ""require[] a plan or other documentation containing environmental information"" (Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5, subd. (a)); must prohibit approval or adoption of an activity if feasible alternatives or mitigation measures ""would substantially lessen any significant adverse [environmental] effect"" (id., subd. (d)(2)(A), italics added); must provide for public notice, review, and comment (id., subd. (d)(2)(F)); and must mandate the agency's written response to all significant environmental points raised during the evaluation process (id., subd. (d)(2)(D)). Written documentation required by the program must describe the activity, as well as alternatives and mitigation measures ""to minimize any significant adverse environmental impact"" (id., subd. (d)(3)(A), italics added), and must be available for public review and comment (id., subd. (d)(3)(B)).     CESA and CEQA thus establish two independent schemes adapted to two distinct goals. CESA is tailored to provide careful public determination of a narrow issue, i.e., whether apart from any other concern, an individual plant or animal species is in fact ""threatened"" or ""endangered"" as a matter of ""scientific information."" By contrast, CEQA provides a process to ensure that environmental considerations (including, of course, the ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" status of any species) will influence the making and implementation of broader public policy, in which other issues and interests are also properly at play. Aside from a mutual concern with public scrutiny and participation, for which each statute amply provides in its own fashion, the processes of one scheme have little logical relation, in purpose or design, with those of the other. In fact, the Commission cannot follow all the directives of CEQA's EIR provisions, while at the same time adhering to its narrow factfinding discretion under CESA.     Statutes should be reconciled and harmonized where reasonably possible (e.g.,  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Macri (1992) 4 Cal. 4th 318, 326, 842 P.2d 112),  but courts must avoid statutory constructions that lead to illogical or absurd results (e.g.,  Landrum v. Superior Court (1981) 30 Cal. 3d 1, 9, 177 Cal. Rptr. 325, 634 P.2d 352).  Here, despite the majority's laborious attempts to demonstrate otherwise, the two statutory schemes at issue are mutually incompatible. CESA, the statute with specific application to the ""endangered"" and ""threatened"" species lists, must therefore govern to the exclusion of CEQA's inconsistent provisions.     II.     Two United States Courts of Appeals have reached the identical conclusion under the analogous provisions of federal law. Though the majority attempt to distinguish these decisions, the reasoning of the federal cases is pertinent and persuasive.     In  Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus (1981) 657 F.2d 829  (Pacific Legal Foundation), the Sixth Circuit held that when determining whether to list a species as endangered for purposes of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA;  16 U.S.C.A.  1531  et seq.), the Fish and Wildlife Service need not comply with the separate provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA;  42 U.S.C.A.  4321  et seq.), including NEPA's requirement for the preparation and consideration of an environmental impact statement (EIS). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that NEPA governs all environmentally significant federal actions ""to the fullest extent possible."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 833; see  42 U.S.C.A.  4332 (2).) The court further conceded that an ESA listing decision, as such, neither enjoys an express exemption from NEPA, nor is impliedly exempt under a theory of ""functional equivalence."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at pp. 834-835.) Nonetheless, the court concluded that the two schemes were in conflict, such that simultaneous compliance with both was precluded.     Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, reasoned primarily that ESA contemplates a mandatory species-focused determination, in which other matters may not be considered, while NEPA ""supplements the existing goals of agencies and provides that [they] should also consider environmental concerns. [Citations.]"" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835.) Because ""the statutory mandate of ESA prevents the Secretary [of the Interior] from considering the [broader] environmental impact when listing a species as endangered or threatened,"" the issues a valid EIS must identify and discuss cannot be addressed or accommodated. (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at p. 836, italics added.) The filing of an EIS in a listing proceeding therefore serves the purposes of neither ESA nor NEPA. (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at pp. 835-836.)     The Court of Appeals specifically rejected the argument, similar to that embraced by the majority here, that an EIS should nonetheless be required in order to serve the public informational goals of NEPA. As the court explained, ""this purpose [of informing the public] does not exist independent of the primary purpose to insure an informed decision by the agency contemplating federal action . . . . The [EIS] provides the basis for critical evaluation of the agency action by those not associated with the agency. [Citation.] If the agency cannot consider the environmental impact, an [EIS] is useless . . . in evaluating [the agency's] action."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838, italics in original.)     More recently, another federal appeals court concluded that even when ESA requires consideration of issues beyond the needs of the threatened or endangered species itself, ESA's procedures have ""displaced"" those of NEPA in this particular area. In  Douglas County v. Babbitt (9th Cir. 1995) 48 F.3d 1495  (Douglas County), the Court of Appeals addressed the application of NEPA to the designation, under ESA, of an endangered species' ""critical habitat.""     As the court explained, whenever a species is listed as endangered or threatened under ESA, the Secretary of the Interior must also designate its ""critical habitat,"" within which locale federal actions likely to disrupt the species are forbidden. (Douglas County, supra, 48 Cal. 3d at p. 1497; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1532 (5)(A), 1536(a)(2).) Unlike the listing decision itself, the designation of ""critical habitat"" must consider, in addition to the ""best scientific data available[,] . . . the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat."" (Douglas County, supra, at p. 1497; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1533 (b)(2).) The ""critical habitat"" designation must be preceded by notice to the public, the affected states, and the scientific community, and by a public hearing if one is requested. (Douglas County, supra, at p. 1503; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1533 (b)(5).)     Despite ESA's mandate to consider all ""relevant impacts"" of a ""critical habitat"" designation, the Douglas County court held that NEPA's EIS requirement is inapplicable in this context. The court reasoned, inter alia, that in a statutory scheme adopted and amended after NEPA, Congress made no mention of NEPA, instead providing careful and comprehensive, but clearly disparate, statutory procedures by which the designation of critical habitat was to occur. Thus, the court concluded, by rendering the provisions of NEPA ""superfluous"" in this regard, Congress had made an implicit choice that the specific procedures set forth in ESA for the ""critical habitat"" determination should displace those of NEPA. (Douglas County, supra, 48 F.3d at pp.1502-1503.)     The federal courts' reasoning is compelling for purposes of the analogous California statutes. Here, as in the federal scheme, the decision to list or delist a threatened or endangered species is governed by specific and comprehensive legislation that was adopted after the statute addressing environmental decisionmaking in general. California's endangered species statute, like its federal counterpart, makes no mention of other environmental laws, but instead mandates particular agency action after the exercise of a narrow, scientific, and species-focused factfinding discretion. In California, as under federal law, the nature of the decision required is incompatible with the broader interest-balancing function of environmental statutes like CEQA and NEPA. And CEQA, like NEPA, has no pure ""informational"" function where the ""information"" at issue could have no actual effect on the agency's decision.     Moreover, in our state, as under the federal analogs, the specific statutory procedures for a list/delist action are detailed, distinct, and tailored to the particular scope of the agency's discretion. Hence, it is sensible to infer that our Legislature, like Congress, has ""displaced"" more general procedures which might otherwise apply, and has rendered them ""superfluous.""     The majority, however, reject the federal courts' analyses for purposes of California law. Their reasons for doing so are unpersuasive.     First, the majority suggest that even under the controlling federal law, Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, ""presents [no] strong case of statutory irreconcilability warranting an exemption from environmental review."" According to the majority, Pacific Legal Foundation rests on a ""questionable"" interpretation of the federal irreconcilability standard set forth in  Flint Ridge Development Co. v. Scenic Rivers Assn. (1976) 426 U.S. 776, 49 L. Ed. 2d 205, 96 S. Ct. 2430.  In Flint Ridge, the United States Supreme Court concluded that because NEPA ""was not intended to repeal by implication any other statute,"" a federal agency is exempt from NEPA's EIS requirement where compliance would create a ""clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority."" (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 788.)     As the majority note, Flint Ridge considered whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must prepare an EIS pursuant to NEPA before allowing a ""statement of record"" filed under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (Act) to go into effect. Under the Act, the Secretary had no discretion to disapprove a statement except for facial inaccuracy, and the statement automatically became effective unless the Secretary notified the filing developer within 30 days that the statement was deficient. Finding it ""inconceivable"" that NEPA's EIS process could be completed within the mandatory 30-day period provided by the Act, the high court held that NEPA must give way. (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at pp. 788-791.)     In  Pacific Legal Foundation, supra,  the court acknowledged that the ""time constraint"" at issue in Flint Ridge was not present (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835), but it nonetheless found a similar degree of incompatibility between two statutory schemes. Contrary to the majority's contention, nothing in Pacific Legal Foundation is inconsistent with Flint Ridge. Flint Ridge applied the sensible principle that if a statute imposes specific duties on a particular agency, or limits that agency's discretion, in a way that precludes compliance with other, generally applicable laws, the latter must defer to the former. As Pacific Legal Foundation explained at length, ESA presents such a conflict with NEPA.     An identical tension arises between CESA and CEQA. Pacific Legal Foundation's conclusions were sound for purposes of federal law, and they are equally compelling here.     The majority suggest that significant differences between the state and federal schemes diminish the force of the federal decisions for California purposes. In particular, the majority stress that CEQA, unlike NEPA, includes no implied exception for ""functional equivalence,"" but exempts ""functionally equivalent"" environmental schemes from the EIR requirement only under the express provision for ""certified regulatory programs"" ( Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 204, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537  (Wildlife Alive); Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5).     However, the federal decisions that found NEPA inapplicable to endangered species list proceedings under ESA did not primarily rely on any federal theory of ""functional equivalence"" between the two schemes. Indeed, as  Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d 829  acknowledged, the listing or delisting of a species under ESA is not exempt from NEPA for any such reason. On the contrary, the federal cases reasoned that the goals, purposes, standards, and agency discretion contemplated by the two schemes are incompatible, such that where the more specific statute expressly applies, it displaces the more general. Similar considerations apply here. 3              FN3  The majority suggest the     relevance of Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, is reduced by     that decision's substantial reliance on the premise that the     listing of a species as endangered or threatened under ESA     necessarily promotes environmental goals regardless of     compliance with NEPA. Such reasoning, the majority conclude,     has no force in a delisting proceeding, where the result may     be to withdraw environmental protections to which the species     was formerly entitled. Whatever the merits of this argument     in the abstract, it distorts the analysis of Pacific Legal     Foundation. That case did suggest, as a     ""makeweight,"" that NEPA need not apply because a     decision to list a species as endangered or threatened can     only benefit the environment in any event. (See  Pacific     Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 837.)  However,     the principal thrust of the decision, equally applicable     here, is that the standards and procedures governing agency     action under the two statutory schemes are in irreconcilable     conflict.        In sum, the majority provide no convincing reason to depart from the federal precedent when deciding the issue presented here. I would embrace those authorities, by analogy, as dispositive.     III.     The majority offer other arguments for a conclusion that CEQA must apply to a list/delist decision under CESA. First, they note that the Legislature has provided express exemptions from CEQA where it deemed such treatment appropriate. (Citing Pub. Resources Code,  21080, subd. (b) [miscellaneous exemptions for ""functional equivalence"" and for certain projects meeting strong environmental, commercial, or transportation needs], 21084, subd. (a) [""categorical exemptions"" for projects having no significant adverse environmental effect]; Health & Saf. Code,  44561, subd. (a) [financing and construction of pollution and waste management control facilities]; Wat. Code,  13389 [adoption by regional water quality control boards of local standards for waste discharge into sources of drinking water].) But the Legislature's determination that some government activities are exempt for policy reasons which outweigh the application of CEQA has little bearing on the issue here -- whether two particular statutory schemes exhibit such conflicting designs, functions, purposes, and procedures that they cannot reasonably be applied at the same time.     The majority also assert that California courts have ""consistently"" rejected claims of statutory incompatibility with CEQA. (Citing, e.g., Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d 190, 198-201,  553 P.2d 537, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377  [setting of hunting seasons pursuant to Fish and Game Code];  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (13 Cal. 3d 263, 282-286, 118 Cal. Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017  [approval by local agency formation commission of municipal annexation pursuant to Knox-Nisbet Act];  Environmental Protection Information Center v. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, 620, 216 Cal. Rptr. 502  [approval of timber harvesting plan under Forest Practices Act];  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 570, 581, 138 Cal. Rptr. 241  [Coastal Commission permit issuance procedures]; also cf.  Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1231, 876 P.2d 505  [application of CEQA's non-EIR provisions to Forest Practices Act].) In none of the cited examples, however, was an agency expressly constrained, contrary to CEQA, to focus on one severable aspect of environmental policy, then provided with detailed procedures, different from CEQA's, but tailored to ensure that this narrowly focused environmental decision would be made in an informed, careful, sensitive, and public way.     CEQA, like NEPA, must be interpreted ""to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247, 259, 104 Cal. Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049,  italics added.) However, no inference arises that CEQA may ride roughshod over the clearly contrary provisions of another statutory scheme, simply because neither statute has expressly recognized the conflict.     IV.     The majority concede, if reluctantly, that CESA does not permit a list/delist decision to be influenced by environmental impacts beyond the ecological status of the subject species itself. However, the majority urge, this limitation does not preclude a harmonized application of CEQA to a CESA proceeding.     First, the majority point to a particular section of CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21004, as an indication that CEQA was intended to apply, in adapted form, even where agency discretion is limited by other statutes. Section 21004 provides that, in mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a project on the environment, a public agency may exercise its ""discretionary powers,"" express or implied, as provided by ""other law,"" but ""only"" such powers. (Italics added.) 4              FN4  Public Resources Code section     21004 provides: ""In mitigating or avoiding a significant     effect of a project on the environment, a public agency may     exercise only those express or implied powers provided by law     other than this division. However, a public agency may use     discretionary powers provided by such other law for the     purpose of mitigating or avoiding a significant effect on the     environment subject to the express or implied constraints or     limitations that may be provided by law.""        This statute provides no support for the majority's views. By its plain terms, although Public Resources Code section 21004 allows agencies to ameliorate environmental effects through use of their existing ""discretionary powers,"" the statute does not enlarge the limited and narrowly focused ""discretion"" the Commission may exercise in a list/delist proceeding under CESA.     When it adopted Public Resources Code section 21004 in 1982, the Legislature explained at length the statute's purpose and effect. Section 21004 was designed to address pending litigation which asserted that CEQA independently empowered all agencies to ""impose fees and other exactions"" to achieve environmental ends. (Stats. 1982, Ch. 1438,  4, subd. (b), p. 5485.) On the contrary, the Legislature declared, while agencies may use their existing powers -- such as the powers to levy fees, impose exactions, or condemn property, if present -- with CEQA's environmental goals in mind, agencies acquire no new or different enforcement powers solely by virtue of CEQA. (Id., subd. (a), p. 5484.)     This amendment to CEQA, designed to clarify that statute's limitations in a particular context, cannot be construed to extend the reach of CEQA's EIR provisions by superimposing them over the express and conflicting provisions of other environmental laws. If Public Resources Code section 21004 has any implications for the issue presented by this case, they are contrary to the one seized upon by the majority. 5              FN5  The majority suggest at length     that the Commission's decision, under CESA, to delist the     Mojave ground squirrel was exempt from CEQA's EIR requirement     only to the extent expressly excused by strict compliance     with the alternative procedures set forth in the Commission's     ""certified regulatory program."" (See Pub. Resources     Code,  21080.5; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5.) But     the Secretary of Resources only ""certified"" the     ""regulatory program"" administered by the Commission     in 1976, thus exempting the 1976 ""program"" from the     EIR requirement of CEQA. This 1976 ""certification""     raises no inference that the Commission's proceedings under     CESA are part of the ""certified regulatory     program,"" or are otherwise subject to CEQA. The     ""program"" the Secretary ""certified"" did     not include the subsequently adopted CESA, with its distinct     procedural provisions. Indeed, because the procedures set     forth in the Commission's ""certified regulatory     program"" were intended as the ""functional     equivalent"" of the preparation and consideration of an     EIR under CEQA, they are as much at odds with the detailed     procedural requirements of CESA as is CEQA itself. (See text     discussion, ante, pp. 7-8.) Hence, the Commission's     ""certified regulatory program"" cannot be viewed as     evidence of  harmony between CESA and CEQA.       Finally, the majority falter when they attempt to explain how CEQA's EIR's procedures (or the ""functionally equivalent"" process set forth in the Commission's ""certified regulatory program"") can be adapted to a list/delist proceeding, and why such an adaptation serves the purposes of both statutes. In these strained and tortured efforts, the fallacy of the majority's position becomes apparent.     First, the majority suggest, adherence to CEQA forces the Commission to consider environmentally sensitive ""alternatives"" to the proposed ""project."" But as the majority appear to concede, in CESA proceedings to remove a species from the threatened or endangered list, the Commission has only two ""alternatives."" These choices are to delist if ""scientific information"" persuades the Commission that the species is not endangered or threatened, and to refrain from delisting if the evidence is otherwise.     These limited ""alternatives,"" and the pertinent evidence bearing on each, are necessarily set forth in the documentation and public commentary required by CESA itself. Moreover, as previously indicated, CESA provides its own careful and detailed procedures for ensuring the Commission's reasoned choice between the only two available ""alternatives."" The Commission must make a ""finding[]"" whether the requested action to delist is ""warranted."" That ""finding[]"" is subject to judicial review of the Commission's reasoning, and cannot be formally implemented in any event until the rulemaking processes of the APA have been completed. Here, the Commission explained in detail its reasons for concluding that the Mojave ground squirrel was not endangered or threatened within the meaning of CESA, and must therefore be delisted. Accordingly, the majority make no convincing case that CEQA must be superimposed on CESA in order to ensure the Commission properly considers available ""alternatives.""     Next, the majority insist that an EIR or equivalent document will identify measures to ""mitigate"" the ""project's"" adverse environmental effects. But as the majority acknowledge, the consideration of ""mitigation measures"" to avoid any adverse effect of delisting on the subject species is simply inappropriate. Because a species may not be delisted if it is threatened or endangered, the decision to delist is a determination that no such threat or danger exists. Accordingly, there is no place or need for the ""mitigation"" of ""adverse"" environmental impacts to which a species might be exposed by a decision to delist it. 6              FN6  Apparently desperate to     demonstrate how an EIR under CEQA would promote and     complement the narrow goals of a delisting proceeding under     CESA, counsel for appellant suggested at oral argument that     an EIR would have forced the Department to conduct the     reliable count of the Mojave ground squirrel's population     which is missing from the current record. But the expert     species status report required from the Department under CESA     itself should contain such a count where the information is     pertinent and available; an EIR adds nothing in this respect.     Here, the record makes clear that a reliable count of the     Mojave ground squirrel population is lacking for reasons of     practicality and availability which have nothing to do with     the absence of an EIR under CEQA.        Thus left to grasp at straws, the majority proffer a more convoluted theory for the relevance of CEQA's ""mitigation"" requirements. The majority suggest that even if a decision whether to delist must focus solely on the ecological status of the listed species itself, the Commission may take steps otherwise within its authority to mitigate any adverse effects of its decision on other flora and fauna that share the subject species' habitat. Consideration of an EIR or equivalent document during the delisting process, the majority reason, will ensure identification of any such incidental species impacts, and of feasible measures to mitigate or avoid them. For example, the majority suggest, if an EIR prepared for proceedings to delist one species discloses that the delisting may adversely affect another species, the Commission might consider such remedial actions as ""ordering the Department to place [the incidentally] affected species on its list of birds and mammals of special concern for further study and observation."" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 37.)     The majority thus imply the need for two simultaneous and parallel proceedings. One proceeding, under CESA, must determine narrowly whether a listed species should be delisted on the basis of its own ecological status. Another equally elaborate proceeding, under CEQA, must identify and mitigate any and all adverse ""incidental"" effects of the delist decision on plants and animals whose status is not under formal consideration. 7  Thus, in the majority's view, the CEQA ""tail"" wags the CESA ""dog.""           FN7  By the majority's topsy-turvy logic, these     incidentally affected species would apparently be entitled to     more sensitive consideration than the candidate for delisting     itself. The majority concede that because delisting means the     subject species itself is not endangered or threatened, an     EIR would not have to identify measures to     ""mitigate"" the adverse environmental effect of     delisting on that species. On the other hand, according to     the majority, the EIR would have to disclose     ""mitigation"" measures for other flora and fauna     whose threatened or endangered status is not even at issue.     This cannot be the law.       The short answer is that in a proceeding to list or delist a particular species, CESA mandates a focus on the status of that species alone. The statute does not contemplate that a proceeding to consider whether one species is threatened or endangered shall become a forum for debate about the status of others. By the same token, CEQA seeks to ensure that an agency will decide on the basis of full environmental information whether to authorize or implement the ""project"" itself. Under CESA, as the majority admit, the Commission's decision whether to delist one species cannot be based on the possible incidental impacts on other species. Hence, in this respect as well, the majority has provided no justification for ""grafting"" an EIR requirement onto a CESA list/delist proceeding. 8            FN8  Of course, the Department and     the Commission should always identify and respond to any     environmental concern for which they are responsible by law.     It does not follow, however, that a proceeding to delist one     species under CESA is invalid under CEQA unless it included     an EIR alerting the Commission to the potential effect on     other species, even though such information could have no     legal effect upon the Commission's specific decision whether     to delist.        The majority find one other reason, relevant to this case, why the Commission should be subject to CEQA's procedures as well as CESA's when deciding whether to remove a species from the endangered or threatened list. The majority suggest that the Commission violated its own ""certified regulatory program,"" and thus erred under CEQA, when it made a ""finding[]"" to delist the Mojave ground squirrel (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5) without simultaneously providing a public response to each ""significant environmental objection[]"" raised by the public comments and testimony. (See Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(D); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5, subd. (h).) That CESA and the APA require such responses, in writing, before the Commission's ""finding[]"" can be implemented as a formal rule is insufficient, in the majority's view, because it does not serve CEQA's purpose of demonstrating that the relevant environmental issues were fully considered in advance of the agency's actual ""final decision.""     Again, the majority's value judgments are contrary to the Legislature's own policy and procedural choices when it adopted CESA. In the first place, CESA does not permit the Commission to consider, much less ""respond"" to, environmental considerations beyond the threatened or endangered status of the individual species under consideration. On the other hand, CESA provides in detail for public participation adapted to the limited nature of the Commission's discretion. These procedures include public notice, hearing, and comment, a formal ""finding[]"" of ""warranted"" action, and an equally public APA rulemaking process in which the Commission must make a complete response to pertinent comments and objections. (See discussion, ante, pp. 5-6.) The majority present no convincing reason why this considered process must, or even may, give way to conflicting provisions of CEQA.     V.     In sum, I am persuaded that CESA and CEQA represent distinct and exclusive statutory schemes, tailored to different purposes and goals, and incapable of reconciliation. Accordingly, I conclude that the Commission acted properly insofar as it adhered to CESA's procedures in its decision to delist the Mojave ground squirrel, without additional efforts to comply with the conflicting provisions of CEQA. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.     BAXTER, J.
