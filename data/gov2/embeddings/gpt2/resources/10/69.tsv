First Trombones                            Ideally, a student's first trombone should offer a                            balance of tone, craftsmanship, and superior design                            and materials. Our selection offers you a selection of                            the best features available today.                              Many first trombones                            are made with a 2-piece bell (where the instrument's                            bell is soldered onto the body). This dampens                            vibrations and affects sound and projection. You can                            also choose a trombone with a ""seamless"" bell, where                            the two pieces are joined without solder and creates a                            seamless one-piece bell for continuous, even                            vibrations in all registers.                              The slide on a first                            trombone should move without any resistance                            whatsoever. Tolerances, manufacturing techniques, and                            craftsmanship of the inner and outer slides will                            determine how effortlessly it moves, providing                            accurate and easy placement.                              Buy New or Used Trombones  for the Dedicated Student                              These trombones feature better quality in materials                            and craftsmanship and more handwork than first                            trombones for better tone and response. Other options                            such as red brass bells provide increased tonal                            coloration, while the addition of an F attachment (a                            rotor-type valve triggered with the thumb) increases                            the note range of the instrument.                              Maintenance                              Maintenance and care are the most important factors in                            maintaining the playability and longevity of your                            instrument.                              Slides need regular                            lubrication to keep them moving quickly and smoothly.                            Trombone pipes and mouthpieces need to be washed out                            regularly with brushes or snakes. This will keep grit                            and dirt from lodging inside the instrument and                            damaging the slide casing.

The Nationwide Employment Check includes a sex offender registry check, a nationwide criminal check, address history, identity verification and more.    oys & Girls Club employees and volunteers are responsible for a variety of duties, including coaching sports activities, leading after school tutoring and mentoring, and serving as general instructors, referees and scorekeepers,explained Kathy Haggart, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue. e must be absolutely sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent people who should not have access to our kids out of the Boys and Girls Club system.  With Inteliussupport, we are taking progressive steps to keep Boys and Girls Clubs safe places where parents can be confident that their kids are surrounded by positive role models who have their best interests at heart.    Jeff Powell, founder of the National Child Safety Foundation and vocal advocate of background checks for child safety, commended the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue for their proactive approach to screening.   oo often, child care organizations are jolted to take a closer look at hiring policies only after a child safety is compromised or they experience a close call,said Powell. ut increasingly, organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue are proactively screening volunteers and employees, and parents are insisting on that level of precaution. Intelius is dedicated to giving individuals and organizations the ability to make better decisions about the safety of our kids. Today, background checks are convenient, and more accurate and cost-effective than ever, leaving little excuse for child-centric organizations not to screen. Kudos to the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue for doing it right./p>  hild safety is a core value for Intelius, and helping the Boys & Girls Club of Bellevue create the safest possible environment for kids is one way we can continue that commitment,said Edward Petersen, vice president of sales and marketing for Intelius. roactive screening by any organization that works with children, including childcare providers, youth groups and after school activity centers is a vital step to ensuring parents have peace of mind that their children are in good hands.

Sundays are so constant - you just know one of your crucial players will miss occasionally.  Wouldn it be great to have a complete band sound even when someone is missing?    Do you have newer players who could use more confidence?  They gain it by hearing their part the one you sequenced for them, even as the band plays along.   Ramp up a vamp Transitions can be a challenge.  You just finished a quiet song.  The next one is a little more intense.  You are wondering how to get there.
