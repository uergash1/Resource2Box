Interesting Facts about the Korean Language                     Korean is the official language of North and South Korea.           Divided into multiple dialects, the primary dialect of South Korea is based on           the local dialect of Seoul, while the primary dialect of North Korea is based           on the local dialect of Pyongyang. Diversity between dialects is minor, with           most being mutually intelligible- the primary difference between them being the           use of stress. On the other hand, the small island of             Jeju  (pop. 550,000), off the southern coast of Korea, has a unique and           largely unintelligible dialect. Many Korean linguists consider it to be a           different language altogether.                    Korean largely utilizes Honorifics, or the use of special nouns           or verb endings to specify the subjects social status (similar to Japanese).           Verbs are not conjugated as in European languages, but are modified for tense           and also relationship between the people speaking. The use of Honorifics must           be paid attention to closely when translating in Korean. Improper use could           insult your audience.                    History of the Korean Language           Korean is commonly thought to be in a family of its own (not           closely related to other languages). Some believe it to be part of the Altaic           languages and many Japanese linguists consider it to be closely related to           Japanese. Due to the diverse landscapes, islands and mountain regions of Asia,           it is not uncommon to have language-isolates such as Korean and Japanese in           geographically isolated regions. Although one can easily see the similarities           between Korean and Chinese, they are only superficial (the two languages are           not related). Close contact between the two nations over thousands of years has           resulted in great influence over both the Korean spoken language and writing           systems long after the Korean language was developed.                    Written Language                    Due to its geographical proximity to China, Koreas writing           system, like many others, began as a borrowing of the Chinese writing system to           record the local spoken language. Chinese characters ( Hanja )           were used to write Korean based on both pronunciation and meaning, leading to a           complex system more often used by the rich and elite.                    It wasnt until the middle of the 15th century that King Sejong           ordered a group of scholars to create the  Hangul  writing           system, an alphabet ( Jamo ) consisting of 10 vowels and 14           consonants which are written in blocks of 2-5 letters.                    The Korean Alphabet (Hangul)           In the example below, you can see that the korean word for           Hangul is comprised 2 character blocks which are then made from 3 letters ( Jamo           ) each.             =      +               +                             and       +                +                         Hangul did not become popular until the mid 20th century.           Today, like with Japanese, Hanja (Chinese characters) is still used           side-by-side with Hangul. Today, well over 50% of Korean vocabulary is made up           of Sino-Korean words, derived from Chinese characters. Modern terminology is           usually derived from Japanese and European languages such as English and           German.           Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Korean is written with spaces in           between words and punctuation marks are used similarly to European languages.           Like with Chinese and Japanese, modern Korean has left the old style of writing           top-to-bottom, right-to-left in favor of the more western left-to-right system.                               Interesting Facts About Korean                     "" Chinese words are still considered prestigious and elite           within the Korean Language, primarily due to the rich literal history            generally recorded in the Hanja script.                    "" South Korea still uses Hanja in its writing. North Korea has           completely eliminated Hanja.                    "" Jamo consonants were designed to illustrate the general           morphology of the mouth and throat for that sound. Vowels were designed to           represent mans place on earth under heaven.                    "" Like Japanese and Chinese, Korean can still be correctly           written top-to-bottom,  right-to-left.                    "" South Korea has a 98% literacy rate.

The language is also spoken   widely in neighbouring Yanbian, China. Worldwide, there are around 78 million   Korean speakers, including large groups in the former Soviet Union, the United   States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and more recently the Philippines. The language   is strongly associated with the Korean people. Czech translation services: translate from Czech into Korean, translate from Korean into Czech, Korean translator                      The genealogical   classification of Korean is debated. It is sometimes placed by linguists in the   Altaic language family, though others considered it to be a language isolate.   Korean is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax.

Sino-Korean   characters, or hanja, are also used in writing. While the most commonly used   words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the   vocabulary consists of words composed from hanja.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         OUR SERVICES                                              You can order our translation services from/into Korean in our  quotation page  or just filling in contact form on the left side of the page.                                                                                                                      WE TRANSLATE                                                                   Arabic                       Azerbaijanian                       Armenian                       Belarusan                       Bulgarian                       Chinese                       Croatian                       Czech                       Danish                       Dutch                       English                       Estonian                       Finnish                       French                       German                       Georgian                       Greek                       Hebrew                       Hungarian                     Italian                             Japanese                  Kazakh                 Korean                 Latvian                 Lithuanian                 Macedonian                 Mongolian                 Norwegian                 Persian                   Polish                 Portuguese                 Romanian                 Russian                 Serbian                 Slovak                 Slovenian                 Spanish                 Swedish                 Turkish                 Ukrainian                                                                   USEFUL LINKS                                  Online dictionaries                                                                                                                                    We translate into:                                Korean-Arabic                  Korean-Azerbaijanian                  Korean-Armenian                  Korean-Belarusan                  Korean-Bulgarian                  Korean-Chinese                  Korean-Croatian                  Korean-Czech                  Korean-Danish                  Korean-Dutch                  Korean-English                  Korean-Estonian                  Korean-Finnish                  Korean-French                  Korean-German                  Korean-Georgian                  Korean-Greek                  Korean-Hebrew                  Korean-Hungarian                  Korean-Italian                  Korean-Japanese                   Korean-Kazakh                  Korean-Latvian                  Korean-Lithuanian                  Korean-Macedonian                  Korean-Mongolian                  Korean-Norwegian                  Korean-Persian                  Korean-Polish                  Korean-Portuguese                  Korean-Romanian                  Korean-Russian                  Korean-Serbian                  Korean-Slovak                  Korean-Slovenian                  Korean-Spanish                  Korean-Swedish                  Korean-Turkish                  Korean-Ukrainian                                                                                             ABOUT   |   SERVICES   |   REFERENCE   |   INFORMATION   |   PRICE LIST   |   CAREER   |   ORDER   |   CONTACT US                                                               © 2006 IVEX Central s.r.o.
