Formats may be proprietary or nonproprietary, native to one particular          software program or useable in a number of programs, and each has its          own characteristics, making one ""better"" than another for its          desired use. This wide range of characteristics creates a challenge to          interoperability. How is a user to know which file format is best for          them?         CISD          Response Strategy:  NIST          can assist the industry by providing an inventory of digital content types          and formats. This page is intended as a reference to inform the public          of what is out there - primarily, each format's particular characteristics          and issues when converting. It is also only an introduction to the basics          of the standards, not a detailed technical resource. For more detailed          information, please follow the links at the end of each section.          Several          standards are discussed on this page. Inclusion of a standard or product          is not an endorsement. Conversely, omission is not intended to deprecate          its use. If there are any terms mentioned here that you are unfamiliar with, please refer to the  glossary .         This          document will continue to change as more information is added and corrected.

Dozens more are          out there, but these seem to be the most popular, or those ""on the          cutting edge."" Some formats would be worth looking at due to their          superior compression, but only appeal to a small sector because they are          native, proprietary formats. In the case of MDLP formatted audio, it is          only used by Sony MiniDisc's Net MD Walkman series. ( More           about MDLP formats and usage.) Others work similarly to other, more popular          file types, like AIFF (Mac) to WAV (PC). ( More           about AIFF.)         As audio          copyright infringement becomes more of a concern to record companies,          some are encrypting their CDs to make them unreadable in home computers.          Thus, converting your CD collection to a digital music library is impossible          with these CDs. Even so, additional software - programs called rippers          and encoders or de-encoders - are necessary to extract the data from the          CD. A simple search on a software download site will yield hundreds of          results.          Listed          below is the interoperability of the formats already looked at, with links          to more information about the file format.         AAC:           Encoding          used by Universal, BMG and Liquid Audio, but due to different encryption          may not be compatible with some software and hardware players; increased          interoperability hindered by AAC Licensing Agreement.  More .           AC3:  Since AC3 is primarily used for DVD audio, it is not as common          on a user-level or on the Internet, but that is changing as many are realizing          its superior quality over even CD audio without massive file sizes. A          few programs exist to convert AC3 into more popular user-level formats          like MP3 and WAV.  More .           MIDI:  Designed for interoperability between different synths, but          its interoperability with other audio formats is limited.  More .           MP3:  A number of independent programs exist to de-encode MP3 to          WAV very simply.  More .           RealAudio:  As a proprietary format, conversion programs are limited.           More .           Waveform:  Numerous freeware and shareware programs exist to convert          WAV to MP3 and vice versa, other file formats more limited. More .           WMA:  Available programs most commonly convert to WAV, MP3, and          OGG. (OGG is an open-format file format from  Vorbis           that is still in its infancy. It supports 48kHz, 16-bit, multi-channel          high-quality audio.)

They are however, those most widely used, or those primed to become            most widely used. Plenty of formats that seemed to have potential didn't,            or haven't, gotten off the ground, such as  JPEG-LS             (see section 2.3). There are also numerous formats that are native to            only one particular program, such as  Adobe            Photoshop 's PSD.                 As many formats as          there are, there are even more programs to create, edit, and convert them.

New formats are still emerging,        however.  VP5  by        On2Technologies, released in February 2002, for example, claims to deliver        higher quality at lower bit rates than MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Real 8, Windows Media,        and QuickTime, but has yet to take hold.

It is an introduction to the basics of            the standards. For more detailed information, please follow the links            at the end of each section. If there are any terms mentioned here that            you are unfamiliar with, please refer to the  glossary .              * Several standards              are discussed on this page. Inclusion of a standard or product is              not an endorsement. Conversely, omission is not intended to deprecate              its use.                                                    Why?                                        There              are hundreds of file formats for representing media online or in print              for countless other applications. Formats may be proprietary or nonproprietary,              native to one particular software program, or useable in a number              of programs, and each has its own characteristics, making one ""better""              than another for its desired use. This wide range of characteristics              can create a challenge for interoperability. How is a user to know              which file format is best for them?

Dozens more are            out there, but these seem to be the most popular, or those ""on            the cutting edge."" Some formats would be worth looking at due to            their superior compression, but only appeal to a small sector because            they are native, proprietary formats. In the case of MDLP formatted            audio, it is only used by Sony MiniDisc's Net MD Walkman series. ( More             about MDLP formats and usage.) Others work similarly to other, more            popular file types, like AIFF (Mac) to WAV (PC). ( More             about AIFF.)           As            audio copyright infringement becomes more of a concern to record companies,            some are encrypting their CDs to make them unreadable in home computers.            Thus, converting your CD collection to a digital music library is impossible            with these CDs. Even so, additional software - programs called rippers            and encoders or de-encoders - are necessary to extract the data from            the CD. A simple search on a software download site will yield hundreds            of results.            Listed            below is the interoperability of the formats already looked at, with            links to more information about the file format.           AAC:             Encoding            used by Universal, BMG and Liquid Audio, but due to different encryption            may not be compatible with some software and hardware players; increased            interoperability hindered by AAC Licensing Agreement.  More .             AC3:  Since AC3 is primarily used for DVD audio, it is not as            common on a user-level or on the Internet, but that is changing as many            are realizing its superior quality over even CD audio without massive            file sizes. A few programs exist to convert AC3 into more popular user-level            formats like MP3 and WAV.  More .             MIDI:  Designed for interoperability between different synths,            but its interoperability with other audio formats is limited.  More .             MP3:  A number of independent programs exist to de-encode MP3            to WAV very simply.  More .             RealAudio:  As a proprietary format, conversion programs are limited.             More .             Waveform:  Numerous freeware and shareware programs exist to convert            WAV to MP3 and vice versa, other file formats more limited. More .             WMA:  Available programs most commonly convert to WAV, MP3, and            OGG. (OGG is an open-format file format from  Vorbis             that is still in its infancy. It supports 48kHz, 16-bit, multi-channel            high-quality audio.)

They are however, those most widely used, or those primed              to become most widely used. Plenty of formats that seemed to have              potential didn't, or haven't, gotten off the ground, such as  JPEG-LS               (see section 2.3). There are also numerous formats that are native              to only one particular program, such as  Adobe              Photoshop 's PSD.

However, in order to increase interoperability between            different systems the file types are more flexible than other media            types, so the list is shorter. Still, this is not meant to be representative            of every text format out there.

New formats are          still emerging, however.

NLS/BPH distributes its talking books on standard audio    cassettes designed to play at half commercial speed and using four tracks. The    NLS configuration can pack up to six hours of reading time onto one cassette.    The C-1 side- and speed-selector switches enable readers to play cassettes created    with the standard, commercial configuration as well as the NLS talking-book    configuration. The C-1 player is shipped with a fully charged, rechargeable    nickel-cadmium battery that will operate the player for about six hours after    being fully charged. Simply plug the player into a standard household outlet to recharge it. Remember, you can always call your library about using    the NLS/BPH player.   Using the Standard Cassette Player   You can operate the C-1 on its battery, or you can take the power cord from    the recessed area in the back of the player and plug it into an electrical outlet.    Here is a typical sequence for reading an NLS cassette talking book.       Open the tape compartment door by pressing the eject key, far right and        marked with a raised square.     Insert the cassette, label side up, with the tape edge facing out. Seat        the cassette by pushing it back until it clicks. Press the compartment door        down until it clicks.     Press and lock down the play key (green with a raised circle) to start        the player. Adjust the volume slide switch (nearest the front edge of the        player).     Stop the player at any point by pressing the red key with a raised ""x"",        first on the left.     To review the cassette soundtrack, press rewind, the key between play and        stop with the raised less-than sign, or arrow head pointing left.     To advance the cassette soundtrack, press fast forward, the key between        play and eject with the raised greater-than sign, or arrow head pointing        right.     To remove a cassette from the player, make sure it is stopped. Press the        eject key, far right with a raised square. The tape compartment door will        snap up, and the tape will pop free of its seated position. To play the        next side, turn the tape over (print/braille label down), reinsert, seat        in the door, and press the door shut. Then press the start key. After reading        sides 1 and 2, rock the side selector switch to the right to listen to sides        3 and 4.      Tips   Switches and Buttons   Speed, volume, tone and side-selector switches are on the right of the player.    Begin at the top of these controls, in the middle of the player as you face    it, and you will find the following:    Variable Speed Control   Used to slow down or speed up the reading of the book. The voice    of the narrator becomes distorted as the playback speed is changed.   Speed   A different sort of speed switch is just under the variable    speed control. This is the speed switch that is used to match the speed of the    player with the recording speed on the cassette. It is a rocker switch. Press,    or rock it down, to the left (15/16) for our talking books. Press, or rock it    down, to the right for commercial cassettes.   Side-Selector Switch   Another rocker switch, the side-selector switch enables readers    to listen to both commercial and talking-book cassettes. Here are the things    you should know about talking-book cassettes before you use the side-selector    switch:       Talking-book cassettes will appear to be oddly numbered because of the        four-side (or, four-track) system. The first side of the first cassette        will be 1. The first side of the next cassette will be 5. Then, 9 and so        on.     Turn the cassette over after each side.     When starting with side 1, push the side selector switch down to the left,        marked 1-2.  Do not change the switch to listen to side        2.  Push the side-selector switch down to the right for sides 3 and        4. It is important to be methodical about the use of the side switch, or        you may find yourself skipping whole segments of the book.     As guidance, the narrator will provide instructions at the end of each        side.     Tone Control   This slider switch raises (to the right) or lowers (to the left)    the pitch of the narrator's voice.   Volume control   The volume control is also a slider. Louder to the right, softer    to the left.   Battery Maintenance   To maintain battery life, the player should be played frequently unplugged,    on battery. After several hours, up to six or until the battery fails, plug    the player back into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. The player    will operate, plugged in, while the battery recharges.   Do not remove the battery.  As a nickel-cadmium product,    it is toxic if not disposed of properly. If you suspect the player will not    work because of battery problems, call the library serving you. They will arrange    for a replacement player.
