Two common paths exist for becoming a paralegal - earning an associate's degree in paralegal studies or pursuing a bachelor's degree and then completing a certification course in paralegal studies.    The associate's degree from a community college is the more common of the two. A less common path offered by some colleges is to earn a bachelor's or master's degree in paralegal studies. This may appeal to potential employers, since it indicates a higher level of training than that earned in a 2-year associate degree program. But with jobs expected to remain plentiful, it shouldn't be necessary to have one of the more advanced degrees. Graduation from one of the 260 paralegal programs approved by the American Bar Association, however, can increase employment opportunities.    Any paralegal program should include:     Courses in the legal application of computers   Internship opportunities   Job placement services   Legal research courses     Voluntary certification does exist. The National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) has set the standards for this certification, called either the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) or Certified Paralegal (CP) credential. It involves a 2-day exam.   Job Opportunities for Paralegals   Most paralegals work at private law firms, while the rest work for the government and corporate legal departments. A very small percentage freelances, contracting out services to various employers.   Employment should increase 22% from 2006 to 2016, much faster than the national average. Since paralegals cost a lot less than lawyers, many firms choose to hire more of them and fewer attorneys.    Salaries for paralegals vary greatly, but the median annual earnings in 2006 were $43,040.

Eager young professionals were trained on the job. But that's changed in recent years. Today,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics advises those interested in pursuing a career as a paralegal to get formal training as those with a degree will have the best job prospects. Getting the requisite paralegal training is fairly simple. There are basically three routes you can take that will equip you with the necessary skills and credentials to apply for paralegal jobs. If you already have a bachelor's degree, you can take a paralegal certification program that will last a few months. If you don't have a degree, then you have two choices: enroll in a two-year paralegal degree program that results in an associates degree, or complete a four-year bachelor's degree program at a college or university. What Paralegals Earn Paralegals salaries range widely depending on what type of firm they work for and where that firm is located. A paralegal working for a high-profile law firm in New York City, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C., for example, will typically earn more than one working for a small firm in Wichita, Kansas. The median annual earnings for paralegals in 2004 was nearly $40,000, including bonuses. The top 10 percent most highly paid paralegals earned more than $61,000.  It's also a good time to enter the paralegal field. Job growth among paralegals is expected to be much faster than the average for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Generally, there are two categories for those          who work in this fieldapplications programmers and systems programmers.          Applications programmers will create programs for a specific job, such          as to write a program to track inventory. On the other hand, systems programmers          create programs to maintain and control computer systems, database systems,          networked systems, etc. The skills required to work in this field does          vary from one job to the next. Employers who utilize computer systems          for engineering or scientific applications tend to prefer individuals          who have degrees in information or  computer          science , engineering, or mathematics. Overall, employers are quite          interested in individuals who possess programming knowledge such as C++          or Java, and other fourth-generation or fifth-generation languages.
