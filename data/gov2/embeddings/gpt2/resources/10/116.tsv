GX062-07-10022605	SEVENTH MEETING  Thursday, October 17, 2002  Welcome and Opening Remarks     CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, welcome to Council         members, guests, members of the public to this, the seventh meeting of         the President's Council on Bioethics.                I note the presence of Dean Clancy, the         designated federal officer whose presence makes this a legal meeting.                I would like to announce that we have at long         last added a lawyer to our staff.  Carter Snead from Ropes & Gray         will be joining us starting in two weeks.  He will be at the meeting         tomorrow.  I will introduce him at that time.                I would also like to announce that we now have         at headquarters a members' office so that should you find yourself in         town and need a place to sit and work and also to interact with our         lively staff, there is a special office set aside fully equipped for         your use.                Our cloning report in final version has been         produced by the Government Printing Office and Public Affairs has         produced the commercial version, copies of which are at your seats.                We have discussions of the report set up in the         months ahead, and I know others of you are talking to Diane about         arranging things on your campuses.                There will be a book forum at the American         Enterprise Institute on the 29th of this month; a session in Baltimore         sponsored by the law school of the University of Maryland and Johns         Hopkins University on the 21st of November; and there are conversations         underway at Georgetown, Princeton, and Chicago for further meetings.                Our next meeting is December 12 and 13 where we         will have what's definite for that meeting is a presentation on the         use of Ritalin and other stimulants in children; a couple of         presentations on aging and longevity research; and Francis Collins of         the Human Genome Project will be talking about uses of genetic         technologies and the prospects for enhancement.                I would also, since as everybody knows this         Council is charged with the monitoring of stem cell research, I would         at least like at this point to make a very brief presentation, an         update on the subject of the monitoring.                As I think everybody knows, since August 9th of         2001, federal funding has been available for research on embryonic stem         cells subject to the particular restrictions announced by the President         at that time.  The implementation of that policy which has fallen to         NIH has yielded the following information for us.                There is a registry of cell derivations that         meet the original criteria and the NIH has identified –  78 cell         derivations that meet the original criteria.                The NIH has reviewed 13 grant applications         involving human embryonic stem cells at its May 2000 Advisory Council         session and 19 grant applications for its October 2002 Advisory Council         sessions, and continues to receive applications each receipt date.                The NIH has also made available infrastructure         grants to help developers defray the costs of providing cell lines,         administrative supplements to encourage expansion of existing projects         to produce preliminary data of human cells, and investigator initiated         grant awards.                And so far the NIH has granted seven, 37, and         eight awards in these respective categories.                Also, six of the NIH intramural labs are         conducting research on human embryonic stem cells, and cumulatively         there are over 45 researchers representing over 40 different research         institutions receiving federal funds for research on human embryonic         stem cells.                The NIH has also finalized four material         transfer agreements with the commercial companies that have developed         these lines.  They are Y Cell, the ESL International, BresaGen,         Inc., and the University of California, San Francisco,         associated with Geron.                Data on how many of these lines are presently         available to be shipped is, however, not easy to get.  At present three         developers have lines available for shipment totaling five different         cell lines.          Finally, I'd like to mention one recent         development that I think is pertinent to our ongoing deliberations.          Since the last meeting, researchers at the National University of         Singapore funded by ESL have announced the successful culture of human         cells on human feeder cell lines.                This is a newly derived cell line, and         therefore under current policy, federal funding could not be used to do         research with it.  All of the lines that are in the NIH registry were         supported on animal feeder cells so that should human trials be         required, these cells would at least at the moment not be available for         use under the xenotransplantation regulations.                This new development, I think, will probably be         important for us as the pressure might mount for work on these new         lines that are potentially usable in clinical trials.                That just by way of an update.  Staff is         working ahead on the monitoring of stem cells, and after the beginning         of next year, we will have more to do with that at our regular         meetings.                Questions or comments on that?                (No response.)                CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, the two sessions that         we have planned for this morning are on the topic of choosing the sex         of children, the discussion of current technology and practice, and         then a look at the demographics.

Review Action Items ~                                 Follow up from last meeting’s action items are covered under the         following headings: Center Operation, Quality Management, Projects and         Other.                         II. Center Operation ~                           Sunny shared with Team the ""12 Steps to Keeping Your Job""           hand out as a resource for Center Customers. She requested that the           Team review the handout. The Team made recommendations for changes.                                     Action:  Sunny make changes and e-mail Team final draft copy.                           Resource Specialist Coverage – ESD and WDC will share the coverage           of the Wednesday afternoon gaps for the time being. RS coverage by ESD           (Noon-1:00) and WDC (1:00-2:30).                           Job Hunter Series – Tammy reported that Job Hunter Series           facilitator copies are still on order. The decision about mandatory           attendance of CPP is not yet decided. Implementation date is set for           April 1 st .                           The Team had a conversation about overcoming challenges to           accommodating large numbers of workshop attendees in the hands-on           components of the curriculum.                           In developing a workshop curriculum for the Center, we have a quality         standard which requires a hands-on/interactive component.           L Questions:                                     Does the Job Hunter Series provide customers with opportunities for           hands on participation and what will it look like?           Can the series be broken down into parts?           If there’s a lab component in the series, how will we make the           accommodations when there are 18 computers available?           How much knowledge would a Center Intern need to proctor lab? Do           they need to know content information or just software navigation?                           L   Suggestions:                           Discussion about having two mechanisms to deliver the job hunter           series - demonstration by PowerPoint and hands-on lab usage.           The facilitator could have 1 group in the lab while the 2 nd            group takes a break (groups will alternate in the lab).           Show customers how to navigate through the series by PowerPoint and           provide options to use the lab for further exploration (Center intern           can proctor).                           Further discussion when the Team gets copy of the series for review.                     Action Pending:  Tammy provide members the facilitators handbook         for Job Hunter.                           Volunteer Issues - Gary reported that he would check with Dan Vogel           for legalities around having a community volunteer at the Center.                                     Action:  Gary checks with Dan.                     Action:  Erika provide Gary with draft job description for a         Resource Lobby support volunteer by Wednesday, 2/6.           Gary reported on the behalf of Susan Parker and Angela about getting         an Intern for the Center. The follow up action was a dead end and there         was no outcome. Angela may possibly have another contact from Western         for a work-study student. This would provide some potential advantages         over a volunteer.  Action:  Angela will follow up with new lead.                                       Lab software / New PC’s - The Team was asked to make a list of             recommendations for software that we wan on the lab’s new PC’s.             Team’s recommendation to keep:                                     MS office Suite (Word, Excel, Access & Power Point),           MS Explorer,           Note Pad,           Choices CT,  (there may be a move within ESD to stop using Choices           as a cost saving measure)                     WOIS           ORCA  (may be combined with WILMA in new, multi-state LMI program           now in development)                     Keyboard Trainer & tutorials (Excel & Access).                                       Allied Health PowerPoint Presentation - Gary introduced Christina             Benjamin an Intern from BTC. Christina is working on a PowerPoint             presentation for Allied Health. The recruitment presentation will             provide information about various healthcare fields, salary,             education, physical demand, etc… The completion date for the             project is end of February.                                                 All Staff Training – Tammy and Erika will provide training on             the ""Go2UI.com"" website on February 27 from 4-5. The CUT             forum moved to March 27 from 4:00-5:00.                                   III. Quality Management ~                                       Application Scoring - Gary followed up with the Certification Team           at our Team’s request for clarifications regarding the application           scoring system. They responded and provided an explanation of the           numeric rating – Whatcom’s app scored in the highest quartile,           thereby making it eligible for a site review. They reiterated the CUT           focus on the scoring sheet’s written comments and those           recommendations from the technical writing report to help better           understand the areas of improvement rather than to concentrate on the           application’s numeric scoring.                                               Begin Introduction to Resource Specialist Training Module – A             subgroup of the Training Team was developed to look at a strategy             for identifying module pieces for RS training. Team consisted of             Kathy K, Ronnie Sue and Gary S. Once the training strategies are             identified, the three Centers (Oak Harbor, Skagit & Whatcom)             will divide up content development for the training modules. Whatcom             is already providing training opportunities for Resource Specialists             – All Staff mtg. IT training, problem solving, etc.                                                 Baldrige Learning - As part of human resource development in             assisting staff to better understand the Baldrige quality standards,             staff in Skagit County are providing a ""readiness to             engage"" learning opportunity. The first training will be on             February 14 on all 7 quality standards as a whole system, followed             by a weekly training on one quality standard.                                                             Action:  All CUT members to share information about the           excellent Baldrige-based quality training opportunity for current and           new staff members within their offices/organizations.                                     To reinforce the quality standards, WDC has reorganized their agenda           items around Baldridge criteria. Each item is categorized under one of           the 7 quality standards. Facilitators and staff have an opportunity to           arrange the agenda according to they see fit. The activity helps staff           see that connection between their daily work and how it’s the           quality standards. A sample staff meeting agenda was distributed           demonstrating how agenda topics are organized within the seven           Baldrige criteria.                                                 Mystery Shopper - WA State is looking at customer satisfaction             levels through a mystery shopper evaluation. ESD is leading the             effort. The evaluation will review services from the customers’             perspective (Job seekers/Business customers). They will be using             different measurements i.e. how many rings before pick up, how long             it takes to return calls, etc. The mystery shopper evaluation is a             quality management tool used in researching information and             collecting data, not for singling out staff doing a less than             quality job.                                     WDC 2002 Action Plan - Workforce Development Board is responsible           for governance and oversight of the workforce development system.

To do: develop a more comprehensive overarching schedule that includes all       the work—not just reports.                                  We had a       conversation regarding limited participation in          CQI          meetings.          Noted that at                  Mount Vernon                  meetings our agenda is to       review data and make decisions, but the attendance is continually low.                                  2.              Report       Format  — we need       to develop a template for the QAC report.          Noted that QAC reports need to be completed and mailed one week       prior to the meeting (necessary for review).                                  It was       thought that we could use the Leadership team format:                          1. Actions needing your attention (give us what we need)                         2. Narrative on above                         3. Things we accomplished (this might not be of value for our       audience)                            The team       reports to three groups now: Leadership, DAIT and QAC.          The “What we want to happen” statements are different for all       three groups.                                 For the       report to the Quality Assurance Committee we need to move away from our       focus on process.    QAC will       want one-liners with a description of what this means. When we fix a       problem it will be important to note how this was done and how it may       apply to something else.    We       will need to note systematic things (political thing for the council to       take action on… write a letter to someone e.g.)                                 Some good       ideas for our reports:                          1 st        – what we continue to monitor—these are the high performing. (Doing       well as measured by comment cards, DOL.. (data sources)                          2 nd       –  things we are watching closely or taking action on (non –high       performers).                            3 rd        - action requested from another group/team.                                  At the       top in the narrative include the data reviewed during the time period.          Give information in relation to a longitudinal comparison.          This is a clear directive from QAC — trend line is wanted in       context.                            Tag on       the most recent data compared to the aggregate of previous data       —outlining what that means.    Referenced       Mike’s report out at last DAIT—this would shape our third Thursday       meetings re: how we look at data.           “Data reviewed this period was… here are our findings on it”.                                  NOTE:          Our comment cards continue to be our real time measures of customer       satisfaction.    Think it’s       important that annually we do a direct correlation of the results of the 3       ASC Q’s on our comment cards with the ACSI survey — we think comment       card data is valid and not a biased sample.          Our results compared to their results.          Noted ACSI is on the web — we all need to access this       information.    Alex       recommendation above.                            Brian       pointed out that an exit survey comparison (validating comment cards)       should be done and analyzed annually.          The team agreed to do an Exit Survey.          It is scheduled for:                         Whidbey:    Tuesday       October 14(?)                         Staffed by: Don, Malinda, Kathy H.                                  Summary:       our reports are to be tight, small, to the point.          All our customers what information in this format — “just give       it to me”.    The report IS the       summary.                            Noted       that there is a fair amount of data out there—manage this prior to       creating more data.                            3.              Draft Leadership       Report.                         This will       be covered at our next meeting.                                 4.              Mystery Shopper                                   Review Latest                                   Draft Follow Up Form Response                                   Continue Discussion from              5/15/03                                                     The       results from this last quarter show low ratings in telephone shops.          It was noted that other WDAs are performing high although they also       have low samples.    We cannot       disregard data because we have low samples.          It was noted that Gay is coming back with the specific report on       our sample shops.    For the last       quarter there was one in-person and two telephone shops.

As you leave be really, really careful. Your representation at the Park City Council of Councils was appreciated. We have received training and new ideas and still have a lot to do to build and present ourselves. There are issues to target and decisions of what to do about them. In the mean time, let’s focus on the Mystery Shopper activity which permits us to give feedback to DWS and DWS to educate us on the available services.   OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE RECOGNITION - Kevin Crandall                           1. Kent Gygi                           Going extra mile for all customers; giving quality    service. Example was displayed during lunch today - he bought Judy Bell a Diet    Coke today so she could have a diet drink with her lunch!     Employers request him often for writing job orders, recruiting             and other needs they may have.                                 2. Sherami Jara                           Has the ability of putting people at ease with her    exceptional customer service.     She was involved with coordinating a customer conference where             customers gave feedback on what made them comfortable when applying             for services, etc.                                         MYSTERY SHOPPER UPDATE/ASSIGNMENTS - Bill Snow                           1. The Pilot Project has been completed and positive as well as         negative feedback has been gathered and reported.           2. The objectives which were feedback concerning DWS services to the         Employment Centers and education about DWS (services, pathways,         processes) for the Regional Council were met.           3. The Mystery Shopper program will continue.                           Two Mystery Shopper visits will be made to each    Employment Center bi-monthly.     Completed by January 24, 2002     American Fork: Jack Trent     Heber/Park City: Christie Hulet will send two Micron    staff members     Payson: Gary Ashby     Provo Employment Center: Kevin Crandall     Use the telephone as a job seeker for part of the    mystery shopping. This would be helpful since the telephone referrals at the    Provo Employment Center have tripled, and it would be good to review the    service being given.     Rate only the categories that are applicable.     Use the Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey to gather                 feedback. A written summary is also acceptable.                                                             4. Mystery Shoppers will present findings at each full Council         meeting.           5. The Executive Council members will discuss and evaluate each of         the surveys before releasing the data to the Region Management Team.           6. The Regional Council Executive Committee will finalize the         report(s) and present the information in Mountainland Region Management         Team meeting.           7. Individual Center data will be shared with the Employment Center         manager.           8. Individual Center data will not be shared with other Centers.           9. Based on the scores received, Centers may receive a grade, A or B,         but competition has been removed; thus, the original traveling trophy         and celebration is eliminated.                   CUSTOMER SIMULATION EXERCISE -  Hour                           1. Each Council member will be given a scenario and assigned to an         employment counselor who will be expecting them.                           It will be necessary to give a social security    number, but the information you give for the Form 61 is not trackable, etc.     The information (name, SS#, address, etc.) will be    entered into the computer, but can be made inactive.     Scenarios     #1 Kevin Crandall (Shane Jorgenson)     #3 Christie Hulett (Jenny Nisonger)     #4 Rickie Bryant (Bret Pope)     #5 Ron Tiffany (Veterans)     #7 Judy Bell (Michelle Viertel)     #8 Rod Crockett (Colleen Cowden)     #9 Duane Frisby (Susan Rogers)     #10 Jack Trent (Sarianna Kay)     #12 Larry Ellertson (David Matkin)     #13 Gary Ashby (Jason Miller)                                                             2. Begin at the Information Desk. Give the Information Specialist the         scenario information and follow the pathway as directed.           3. There are four types of services.                           Core     Intensive     Training     Support                                 4. Go to the Information Desk and present the reason you are at the         Center today to the Information Specialist. Follow the instructions and         pathway as directed.           5. As you proceed, ask these questions to yourself: What services         were offered? Was it easy to access these services?           6. If you find something while shopping, make a recommendation(s) to         managers.                           It is important to have staff up on newspaper    articles as to the jobs available. Customers come to DWS wanting information    on job ads such as the one hiring air marshals. There was no information to be    had about this ad. Some information is being shared. Sometimes there is no    information, even after several inquiring phone calls.     Services may be labeled alphabetical, but as a shopper be             careful in judging the information given as the official title may             not be used, but the same information may be given under different             terms.                                 7. After following the ""customer"" scenario, complete the         Mountainland Mystery Shopper Survey and give to Julie.           8. Julie and Bill will rate A or B and report to the Regional         Council.           9. The Mystery Shopper feedback will then be reported in Region         Management Meeting.           10. TANF RAINY UPDATE/PACMIS PROPOSAL - Dave Ostrom                           1. The PACMIS Gap Analysis of October 9, 2001, was performed by         Information Technology International.                           The purpose was to determine whether PACMIS (Public    Assistance Case Management Information System) adequately meets the    eligibility-related business needs of Department of Human Services, DWS and    Department of Health.     Based on the report findings, PACMIS is only meeting    52% of business needs. It only does what we tell it to do. It does not support    looking at other programs. It is now a support system, but a decision making    system is needed.     Recommendations were to replace PACMIS.                                 2. PACMIS is a project costing approximately 20 million dollars and         does have an impact on TANF dollars. Shortfalls caused money shifts.         There are programs that are not being worked on or utilized which would         allow monies. The Adult Literacy program has given $117,000 for the         ""new"" PACMIS.                           Concern: How will the programs giving up money be    impacted? It seems unfair - people versus program.     Answer: PACMIS will utilize information and give assistance to             people more accurately and readily; thus, the people really are             served better.                                 3. PACMIS will come from partnering with other states who want to         implement, some product will be purchased and some will be developed on         our own. TANF surplus funds will be paying for this.                           The expense to enhance the current PACMIS system was    proposed at 2.6 million. The decision was to put this amount into the pot to    building a new system.     Projects in session have money to fund them.     $400,000 is being used to begin the new PACMIS    system.     #42 Education and Training Software-Mtland $183,000     #43 Grant to Fund Literacy Program-Mtland $40,000     #44 Discretionary Services, Family Issues-Mtland $200,000                                                             4. MOTION by Ron Tiffany for approval.                           Rod Crockett seconded the motion.     The voting was unanimous.         PROPOSAL for OREM EMPLOYMENT CENTER AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE -     John Talcott                       1. Justification                           Consistency of Services     Convenience to Customers     Improved Customer Service     Employment Center Design     Consolidation of Offices eliminating duplication of offices in             the same city.                                 2. Approximate cost for the above building: $460,000. This amount         would come from the operating budget. There would be no additional cost         to the State. The on-going costs a year would be $247,000. Other         agencies will rent the currently DWS Region occupied 3rd and 4th floor         spaces at 150 E Center which will pay the State so tax payers are not         getting hit. Agencies are already showing a great interest as to when         DWS will vacate and what properties (desks, chairs, etc.) will remain.           3. Floor space would be 16,500 square feet which is 11,000 square         feet less than what the Region now occupies. However, a lot of the         27,500 square feet we now pay for, is wasted space. The Region does not         facilitate the kind of service DWS gives. The Region would be housed in         the same building, but would be separate from the Employment Center.           4. Central north Orem is the location in mind, but the specific         property has not been selected. There is a glut of office space for rent         in Orem. There will be O&N included on the rent on the new facility.         Fifteen dollars ($15.00), which is a ball park figure includes O&N.           5. It is desired to have the contract secured in the next four to six         months, but the Council’s support is needed by way of vote before this         proposal can be taken to the building utilization committee. This is         early in the process, but it takes a long time to complete the necessary         steps.           6. MOTION by Jack Trent to accept the proposal for an Orem Employment         Center and Regional Administration Office. John forward on to DFCM.                           Seconded by Gary Ashby     A unanimous vote from the 8 Council Members present    was received.     4 additional votes will be taken by telephone calls to the             Council members not present to vote. A total of 12 votes are needed             to have a valid count. Report at the January 24, 2002                                 7. Concern: Will there be money left for failure of equipment and         etc.? Computer recycles will not be impacted.           8. Next Steps (Depending on result telephone calls to voting Council         Members.)                           Present proposal to the building utilization    committee.     Make recommendation to the Senior Management Team,    pending approval to proceed.     Get with the facility planner of DFC - work on RFP,    select site.     Develop floor plans     Have the proposal hit the paper by February, 2002.     If DWS has the money to pay for the building, DFCM will give             the approval.     COUNCIL CONCERNS - None expressed.   DATE OF NEXT MEETINGS                       January 24, 2002 - Location TBA     No meetings in February, 2002.

About                        SAC                        The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council                        was established by Federal law to assure continued public                        participation in the management of the Sanctuary. Since                        its establishment in March 1994, the Council has played                        a vital role in the decisions affecting the Sanctuary along                        the central California Coast. The Council's nineteen voting                        members represent a variety of local user groups, as well                        as the general public, plus seven local, state and federal                        governmental jurisdictions. In addition, the respective                        managers for the four California National Marine Sanctuaries                        (Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, Cordell Bank                        National Marine Sanctuary, Gulf of the Farallones National                        Marine Sanctuary, and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary)                        and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve                        sit as non-voting members. Members are appointed competitively                        by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and                        serve three-year terms. The Council meets bi-monthly in                        open sessions located throughout the 360-mile boundary of                        the Sanctuary.                           The                          Council maintains a firm commitment to the goals and objectives                          of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Program.                          The Council appreciates the efforts of volunteers, non-profit                          organizations, businesses, and citizens, without whose                          support the mission of the Sanctuary would be difficult                          to realize.                                                                                                                                                                                             National                  Marine Sanctuaries  |  National                  Ocean Service  |  National Oceanic                  and Atmospheric Administration                   U.S. Department of Commerce                   |  NOAA Library                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For                  Website comments/questions, contact the  MBNMS                  Webmaster .

Comments and changes were captured on the draft form of the Leadership       Team’s Report and forwarded to Kathy K. for revision.          It was decided that we would drop the customer survey and ASCI fees       for consideration, that we would request the above, and summarize our       completed actions.                                               Mystery           Shopper Results                                         The full report was not       available to         CQI        at this meeting.    Don agreed to       summarize the material and e-mail this to team members.          The goal is to make the information available to staff, summarizing       both the key points and types of questions so that staff can better serve       all customers.                                             Comment           Card Results Display                                         The team agreed to       display the results of the following to customers in resource areas:         1.              Staff provides consistent information.         2.              I got my questions answered.         3.              Overall Satisfaction.         4.              The services met my expectation.                          The team also noted       that the following needs to be addressed: That the information needs to be       presented in a consistent format and that we need to develop protocols for       displaying the information.    We       would like to see each question in bar graph form with an eye-catching,       “punchy” heading.    Also,       the comment card boxes should be located next to the results display thus       encouraging customers to continue providing feedback.                       Note:       Change in date of next          CQI          meeting.

GX034-82-4331219	Regional       CQI Team Notes                July 17, 2003                       Present:    Kathy K.,         Malinda        , Don, Gary, Kathy H., Jim & Mike                       I.          Data Review                         The Team reviewed job seeker       and business comment card, ASCI and Mystery Shopper data available at this       time.    The following       observations were observed:         ·                E-card ratings continue to have lower scores than hard copy       cards.    The number of E-cards       submitted is up and even though they generally generate lower scores, our       total (overall) scores are up.           ·                Data for 2 nd  quarter 2003 for the “How are we       doing?” questions is even or increased from the four quarter average for       all questions.           ·                On business comment cards questions “Need Met” and       “Services Meet Ideal” continue to get the lowest scores for all       questions.    Seven out of ten       questions showed a better or equal score compared to the four quarter       average.           Mystery Shopper data continues to be a struggle for us to know what to       do with.    A meeting is in the       planning with Mystery Shopper administrative staff to talk about how the       Mystery Shopper data compares to local CQI data.          That meeting was originally scheduled locally (our WDA) and we were       to attend, but the meeting has been elevated to the Regional level so we       will not all likely be attending.                         Business Customer       Data                          The Team spent some time       talking about business customer data and the WDA’s current emphasis       toward our business customer ( strategic       goal #4 ).                   Gary                reviewed some of the long standing information we know about our business       customers ( prefer single point of       contact, need well screened applicants, our programs & requirements       are confusing, too much paperwork, emphasis is on our needs rather than       business need, etc ).    At       our last meeting in finishing up on the Problem Resolution Grid we       identified several potential key process related to business customer       which could be addressed.    The       Team also talked about needing more business data from our partners and       placing at least as much emphasis on business data as job seeker data.                 Leadership Report                         The Team spent time       discussing the Leadership (and QAC) report and outlining the points of the       report which Don will draft.    The       narrative of the report will include the information that the                 CQI        Team        is focusing on business customer satisfaction.          We’ve looked at several data sets and have historical data ( local       business card data, ACSI, Whidbey survey and national info                  Gary                  referred to and mentioned above )       and have a fairly solid understanding of the general areas business       customers find our system lacking.    In       comparing business, job seeker and training customers the ASCI data tells       us that business customers rate us lowest of the three customer groups.          The                 CQI        Team        understands that the current emphasis on focusing on business customers       not only is valid from a data standpoint, but connects to our WDA       strategic goals.    The                 CQI        Team        feels a need to connect to more business customer information, possibly       from local partners and obtain a more detailed focus.          The Team will be looking at ASCI business data in more detail to       try and obtain a more detailed focus, but needs help connecting to more       data (we don’t know what we don’t have).          The                 CQI        Team        is headed toward recommending a key process analysis to help achieve this       strategic goal.    A key process       analysis is a large undertaking and we recommend that a new work team be       established to undertake the analysis and make recommendations with the       assistance of the                 CQI        Team        .    The key process the         CQI        is considering recommending is the level of screening and evaluation on       job orders.    The                 CQI        Team        is interested in feedback from the Leadership Team on our potential       recommendations.                       Other                         The       Whidbey exit interview is scheduled for August 14 th . Kathy K.       is working with the Whidbey Center Use team already to develop a customer       survey for that center.    She       will ask the Whidbey Center Use Team if we can add our exit survey to       their questions. We crafted 2 questions that will also be added.          Kathy H. will forward a draft of the entire survey when it is       ready. We will also conduct the same survey at WorkSource Whatcom sometime       in September.    Kathy H. will       staff both exit survey days.                              Review of both the job       seeker and business comment card is scheduled for the next meeting, but we       couldn’t keep from talking about this subject to some degree.          Brief discussions took place on adding a question related to “Are       you disabled?” on the job seeker card and that lead to a discussion       about adding other demographic questions to the card.          With respect to the business card it was suggested that the card be       changed to have the same rating scale as the job seeker card for       uniformity.                           Next       Agenda’s (        Malinda        is facilitator and Mike is scribe, but Mike will be on vacation ).

GX036-67-7510850	Whidbey                   Center                  Use       Team                 February       18, 2003                                         Members Present: Jonette, Bob, Shannon, Kathy, Joyce,       Sharleen, Terri, Brian Guest: Gary Smith (WorkSource Whatcom).                          Agenda:         1.              Customer Comment Card Review.         2.              Vision and Values Review.         3.              Overview of WTS Membership System.         4.              Business Survey.         5.                             WorkSource                Whidbey-                Center                Issues                   Follow-Up           Reports:                    .               Membership card update.         .               Website update.         .               Job fair update.         .               Snohomish WS PowerPoint for Business Services.         ·                New Web Update Article.         ·                Press Releases Completed for this period.         ·                New Center Issues.         ·                New WorkSource Activities.         ·                CQI Calendar Check         6.              Action Plan- Self Assessment         ·                Strategic planning- Identify Improvement Strategies         7.              Other         8.              Build Next Agenda – March 4                   1)             Customer Comment       Card Update :         Kathy and Shannon are re-organizing the data for       presentation at the next CUT meeting on March 18 th .         Action :       Kathy and Shannon will bring information to March 18 th  CUT       meeting.                2)             Vision and Values       Review :         Brian will present at the March 18 th        meeting. This will be training for goals, visions, and values of the       partnership.         Action :       Brian will bring for a future meeting.                3)             WTS Membership       System :         Gary Smith provided an overview of the new membership       system that will be in effect starting Feb. 27 th  in                 Oak                Harbor                (The new computers will be changed out on Feb 25 th  and 26 th ).       The new membership system ensures compliance with the state wide system       which will enable a more comprehensive and usable database that will tell       us who our customers are and what services they are utilizing.                New forms : WorkSource Whatcom initiated a new       form that captures the information needed for SKIES. WorkSource Whidbey       will begin utilizing this form on Feb. 27 th  for all new       membership cards. The information will be collected and entered into SKIES       by Joyce or Bob. The new form allows us to record the jobs that people are       getting and helps our UI customers get credit for job search.           Do not refer to the new membership system as “swipe       card” or “tracking” system. WorkSource Whatcom staff have found that       membership system has a more positive connotation and it makes customers       feel as though they are a part of our system.                If a customer refuses to provide their social       security number, we can provide an alternate form of their membership       number. The formula is as follows:         1)             WDA Numeric identifier (i.e. Northwest = 3)         2)             First two characters of the last name         3)             First two characters of the first name         4)             Birth month (2-digit format)         5)             Birthday (2 digit format)         6)             Gender (M/F)         When/If duplicates occur, append a single digit       number (1-9) at the end.         It is imperative that we encourage customers to       protect their card as their social security number is embedded into the       magnetic strip on the back. While we can provide them a new card there are       machines that can access this information.         Center staff need to double check the daily list of       activities to ensure that all activities for that day are listed on the       sign-in kiosk. This is important for proper tracking of activity       participation.         The new touch screen kiosk is sensitive to touch and       we need to remind customers to use their fingernail or the corner of their       card when they are selecting daily activities.         When making membership cards staff need to capitalize       first and last names so that the database is uniform.         4)             Business Survey :           Bob will       distribute updated version (via e-mail) for discussion at next CUT       meeting.         Action :       Bob will bring updated survey for March 18 th  meeting.                5)             WorkSource Whidbey       – Center Issues :         ·                Website update :         Joe Hudon had created a separate website as       a link to WorkSource Whidbey’s calendar of events. The decision has been       made to cancel this site (sponsored by Tri-pod) and create a link from the       go2worksource website.         Action :       Kathy will work with partnership webmaster to create for Whidbey a site       similar to Whatcom. Kathy will contact webmaster to establish link to new       website. Kathy will let Jonette know when the site is operational and       Jonette will cancel tri-pod site.                 ·                Job Fair update :         The job fair       will be held on         May 22, 2        0                0        3        . Literature for the fair will go out next month. We have invited the Navy       Transition Assistance Office to be listed as a community partner. Emily       Wetzel will let us know about this at a later date. All job fair material       will go out on NWDC letterhead.                ·                Snohomish Power Point       Presentation for Businesses :         Bob is       re-designing and will present during March 18 th  meeting.

They will be       announcing the workshops once a week throughout March.                ·                Center Issues:         Recent       vandalism has prompted the landlord to post “no trespassing” signs       along both the front and back of our building. After these signs are       posted, we will be able to call the police to have loiterers removed       and/or prosecuted for acts of vandalism to the building.                ·                Mystery Shopper       Results:                         Mystery       shopper results from last year were presented for review.
