(a) By no later                  than October 1, 2000, Federal agencies shall implement                  a transportation fringe benefit program that offers                  qualified Federal employees the option to exclude from                  taxable wages and compensation, consistent with section                  132 of title 26, United States Code, employee commuting                  costs incurred through the use of mass transportation                  and vanpools, not to exceed the maximum level allowed                  by law (26 U.S.C. 132 (f)(2)). These agency programs                  shall comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue                  Service regulations for qualified transportation fringe                  benefits under section 1.132-9 of title 26, Code of                  Federal Regulations, and other guidance.                      (b) Federal agencies are encouraged to use any                  nonmonetary incentive that the agencies may otherwise                  offer under any other provision of law or other                  authority to encourage mass transportation and vanpool                  use, as provided for in section 7905(b)(2)(C) of title                  5, United States Code.                  Sec. 2. Federal Agencies in the National Capital                  Region. Federal agencies in the National Capital Region                  shall implement a ``transit pass'' transportation                  fringe benefit program for their qualified Federal                  employees by no later than October 1, 2000. Under this                  program, agencies shall provide their qualified Federal                  employees, in addition to current compensation, transit                  passes as defined in section 132(f)(5) of title 26,                  United States Code, in amounts approximately equal to                  employee commuting costs, not to exceed the maximum                  level allowed by law (26 U.S.C. 132(f)(2)). The                  National Capital Region is defined as the District of                  Columbia; Montgomery, Prince George's, and Frederick                  Counties in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudon, and                  Prince William Counties in Virginia; and all cities now                  or hereafter existing in Maryland or Virginia within                  the geographic area bounded by the outer boundaries of                  the combined area of said counties.                  Sec. 3. Nationwide Pilot Program. The Department of                  Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,                  and the Department of Energy shall implement a                  ``transit pass'' transportation fringe benefit program,                  as described in section 2 of this order, for all of                  their qualified Federal employees as a 3 year pilot                  program by no later than October 1, 2000. Before                  determining whether the program should be extended to                  other Federal employees nationwide, it shall be                  analyzed by an entity determined by the agencies                  identified in section 4 of this order to ascertain,                  among other things, if it is effective in reducing                  single occupancy vehicle travel and local area traffic                  congestion.                  Sec. 4. Guidance. Federal agencies shall develop plans                  to implement this order in consultation with the                  Department of the Treasury, the Department of                  Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,                  the Office of Personnel Management, the General                  Services Administration, and the Office of Management                  and Budget. Federal agencies that currently have more                  generous programs or benefits in place may continue to                  offer those programs  [[Page 24614]]                  or benefits. Agencies shall absorb the costs of                  implementing this order within the sums received                  pursuant to the President's FY 2001 budget request to                  the Congress.                  Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to                  and does not create any right or benefit, substantive                  or procedural, enforceable at law by any party against                  the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities,                  its officers or employees, or any other person.

Joseph Callan /s/ Executive Director for Operations        SUBJECT:   CHANGES TO THE FINANCIAL PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENTLY SHUTDOWN NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS, 10 CFR 50.54(w) AND 10 CFR 140.11     PURPOSE:   To request Commission approval to issue a proposed rule that would amend financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors.    CATEGORY:    This paper covers a major policy question requiring Commission consideration.    BACKGROUND:    This proposed rulemaking is consistent with an SRM dated January 28, 1997, in which the Commission approved a staff recommendation in SECY-96-256 to implement Option 2 for making changes to the financial protection requirements in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11 for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors.    DISCUSSION:    The proposed rule would specify appropriate levels of liability coverage that would be required of licensees that meet specified reactor configurations during permanent shutdown. This would allow nuclear reactor licensees a reduction in onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process.    The proposed rule does not address the financial protection requirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). This subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs are resolved in areas of safeguards requirements, emergency planning, and potential fuel storage handling activities.    COORDINATION:    The Office of the General Counsel has no legal objection to the proposed rulemaking. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer has no resource-related objection to this rulemaking. The Office of the Chief Information Officer concurs that there will be no information technology impacts.    RECOMMENDATION:    That the Commission:    1. Approve for publication in the Federal Register the proposed amendments    to 10 CFR Part 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11 on financial protection requirements    for permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors ( Attachment 1 ).    2. Note:    a. That the proposed amendments will be published in the Federal Register allowing 75 days for public comment.    b. That the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration will be informed of the certification and the reasons for it, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).    c. That a regulatory analysis has been prepared for this rulemaking ( Attachment 2 ).    d. That an Environmental Assessment has been prepared for this rulemaking ( Attachment    3 ).    e. The appropriate Congressional committees will be informed of this action    ( Attachment 4 ).    f. That a public announcement will be issued by the Office of Public Affairs    when the proposed rulemaking is filed with the Office of the Federal Register    ( Attachment 5 ).    g. That resources to complete and implement this rulemaking are included in the current budget.    L. Joseph Callan  Executive Director   for Operations    Attachments: As stated (5)      [7590-01-P]    NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION    10 CFR Parts 50 and 140    RIN 3150-AF79    Financial Protection Requirements for    Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors          AGENCY:   Nuclear Regulatory Commission.        ACTION:   Proposed rule.        SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to allow nuclear reactor licensees to reduce onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown of the reactors if they meet specified reactor configurations. This proposed amendment would reduce the level of insurance coverage commensurate with the risk reduction after the appropriate spent fuel cooling period following permanent shutdown of the reactor.    DATES: The comment period expires (75 days after publication).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background    The current regulations governing insurance coverage for nuclear power reactors are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. These regulations do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with permanently shutdown plants. The exemption process allows reduced insurance coverage for these plants.    Consideration of whether financial protection coverage should be reduced for permanently shutdown plants must take into account the preservation of the solvency of the organization responsible for maintaining and decommissioning these facilities in the unlikely event of a nuclear incident. In addition, consideration would be given to timely payment for valid damage claims by members of the public and minimization of the likelihood that Federal Government indemnity would be exercised for satisfaction of claims for damages.    The regulations in 10 CFR 140.11 require that the licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity, a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more, must have and maintain a primary insurance coverage of $200 million from private sources to protect against offsite liability. In addition, licensees must maintain secondary financial protection in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan. The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in this plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. Thus, the total financial protection for offsite liability for any incident would be the primary layer of $200 million, plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher.    Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage from private sources to provide protection against onsite damage in the event of an accident. These monies would allow the licensee to stabilize and decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The minimum amount of insurance coverage is the lesser of $1.06 billion or the maximum amount of insurance generally available from private sources.    This proposed rule is part of the NRC effort to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. This would complement other amendments for decommissioning, such as the final rule that was published in the Federal Register (61 FR 39278) on July 29, 1996, which clarified the procedures leading to permanent shutdown and, eventually, to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors.    This proposed rule would also address a petition for rulemaking (PRM-50-57) submitted by the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission. The petition requested reduction or, preferably, elimination of the $1.06 billion of insurance for onsite reactor stabilization and accident decontamination that is required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) when all nuclear fuel has been removed from the site. The petitioner also requested that the offsite primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or, preferably, eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.    The proposed rule does not address the financial protection requirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). This subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs are resolved in areas of safeguards requirements, emergency planning, and potential fuel storage handling activities.    Discussion    Several different configurations for permanently shutdown reactors are being established that encompass anticipated spent fuel characteristics and storage modes during the period between permanent shutdown and termination of the license. They are as follows:    Reactor Configuration 1: The reactor is defueled, permanently shutdown, and spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the spent fuel pool is drained accidentally. This configuration encompasses the period from immediately after the core is offloaded to just before the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough that no rapid zircaloy oxidation will take place, and the fuel cladding will remain intact with no gap release if water in the spent fuel pool is lost.    Reactor Configuration 2: The reactor is defueled, permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the spent fuel pool is drained accidentally. In this configuration, the spent fuel can be stored long-term in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. In addition, the site may contain a radioactive inventory of liquid radwaste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.    Reactor Configuration 3: The reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an offsite or onsite dry storage independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) or to a DOE high-level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and may include liquid radwaste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials.    Reactor Configuration 4: Same as reactor configuration 3, except the reactor site has no significant mobile sources of radioactivity such as contaminated liquids (less than 1000 gallons).    There are potential onsite and offsite radiological consequences that could be associated with the onsite storage of the spent fuel in the spent fuel pool for some time after permanent shutdown. In Reactor Configuration 1, in the event of a complete loss of spent fuel pool coolant inventory such as from a beyond-design-basis earthquake scenario, there is a potential for overheating the fuel by decay heat. This sequence could result in a zircaloy cladding fire that may have significant onsite and offsite consequences.    To prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy-cladding fire if all spent fuel pool water is lost, the rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565 0 C. The rod cladding temperature is an important factor that must be considered in modifying the financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors.    In Reactor Configuration 2, the spent fuel has decay heat sufficiently low that the cladding will remain intact even if all spent fuel pool water is lost. However, if there are significant sources of radioactive material stored onsite, it would be appropriate to maintain an adequate level of onsite insurance coverage. Although the offsite consequences are negligible in the Reactor Configuration 2 , because the spent fuel pool is operational and an inventory of radioactive materials exists onsite, an appropriate level of offsite financial protection is required to account for the potential for significant judgments or settlements from litigation that might be instituted and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims.    In Reactor Configuration 3, when spent fuel is no longer stored in the spent fuel pool, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily in mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors. The offsite cleanup costs were found to be negligible for Reactor Configuration 3, but as was noted in Reactor Configuration 2, an appropriate level of offsite financial protection is still required to account for the potential for significant judgments or settlements from litigation that might be instituted and also to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. Because the level of risk has decreased vis-a-vis the Reactor Configuration 2 by having no spent fuel in the spent fuel pool, the level of offsite financial protection required is being reduced by taking into account only the mobile radioactive inventory onsite.    In the Reactor Configuration 4, with no significant amount of mobile sources of radioactivity such as contaminated liquids onsite, there is no need to maintain the same level of insurance coverage for onsite or offsite financial protection as in Reactor Configuration 3. The basis for the transition from Reactor Configuration 3 to Reactor Configuration 4 is the point at which there is less than 1000 gallons of liquid radwaste stored onsite. A limiting value of 1000 gallons has been considered because it constitutes approximately a factor of 500 reduction in volume from the large volume tank used as the basis for the Reactor Configuration 3 limiting event.    In Reactor Configuration 4, if the licensee has cleaned the site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for terminating the license, the necessary level of onsite insurance coverage at this stage would be less than when 1000 gallons of liquid radwaste were stored onsite. Under these circumstances, the onsite coverage could be further reduced or eliminated to account for negligible onsite consequences. However, for offsite financial protection requirements, although the offsite consequences are negligible, some level of public liability financial protection must be maintained as long as there remains in effect a nuclear reactor license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 under the authority of Section 103 or 104 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2133, 2134). See Section 170a of that Act (42 U.S.C. 2210a). Section 170 is commonly referred to as the ""Price-Anderson Act.""    Proposed Regulatory Action    The proposed amendments would adjust the onsite insurance coverage requirements and the offsite financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors based on limiting the spent fuel cladding temperatures for accidents involving loss of spent fuel pool water and the amount of onsite radioactive inventory such as liquid radwaste in post shutdown modes. The insurance amounts are based on the estimated cost of recovery from limiting hypothetical events for specific reactor configurations.    The proposed amendments would also address ""rated capacity"" in 10 CFR 140.11 as used in Section 170a of the Atomic Energy Act to indicate that a permanently shutdown nuclear reactor has a ""rated capacity"" of zero.    The proposed financial protection requirements are as follows.    Reactor Configuration 1 - Fuel in spent fuel pool not sufficiently cool.        The requirements for onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection remain as presently specified in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively.      Reactor Configuration 2 - Fuel could tolerate a complete loss of water in the spent fuel pool.        The onsite insurance coverage requirement is $50 million. The amount of $50 million is to recover from a postulated accident in the spent fuel pool.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation despite negligible offsite consequences.      Reactor Configuration 3 - No fuel in spent fuel pool, risk dependent on radioactive inventory at plant site in decommissioning status.        The onsite insurance coverage requirement is $50 million. The amount of $50 million is the estimated amount needed to recover from a postulated onsite event of a rupture of a large slightly contaminated liquid storage tank.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation that might still be instituted despite negligible offsite consequences; however the liability risk is considered less than in Reactor Configuration 2.      Reactor Configuration 4 - No fuel in the spent fuel pool and no significant source of mobile radioactive material.        The onsite insurance coverage requirements is either $25 million or is eliminated. The amount of $25 million is based on the possibility of having to clean up onsite contamination from an accidental rupture of a less-than-1000-gallon contaminated liquid storage tank during shutdown activities. Elimination of onsite insurance coverage would be warranted when a licensee is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination.          The offsite financial protection requirement is $25 million, based on the potential for claims arising from asserted offsite consequences. This would minimize the possibility that Federal Government indemnification would be required. As noted above, the Atomic Energy Act does not allow a 10 CFR Part 50 licensee to drop this coverage entirely, only to reduce it.      Discussion    This proposed rule would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. The level of financial protection would be determined for permanently shutdown reactors at a level that coincides with their actual configuration stage.    During Reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain onsite insurance coverage and offsite financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.    After allowing the spent fuel to cool down to the point that the maximum spent fuel cladding temperature will not exceed 565 0 C in the event of a loss of water in the spent fuel pool (Reactor Configuration 2), power reactor licensees would be allowed under 10 CFR 50.54(w) to reduce their onsite insurance coverage from $1.06 billion to $50 million. The reason for this reduction in insurance coverage is that the rapid clad oxidation event of Reactor Configuration 1 is not possible. Insurance coverage requirements for Reactor Configuration 2 are based on the fact that there is a possibility for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and significant amounts of mobile radioactive sources remain onsite that have a potential for release during this period. The $50 million coverage would be adequate to clean up the site in the event of a fuel handling accident, an accidental release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool, or a rupture of a large slightly contaminated liquid storage tank.    The proposed insurance coverage requirement for Reactor Configuration 2 does not take into account the reduction in radioactive decay of the spent fuel assemblies with the passage of time during that period. The insurance coverage requirements are based on the conservative assumption of a fuel handling accident shortly after the transition to Reactor Configuration 2. Adjusting insurance requirements during Reactor Configuration 2 based on the decay level of the spent fuel would be burdensome from a regulatory standpoint, as opposed to selecting a bounding figure to encompass any unexpected events concerning the spent fuel pool.    In Reactor Configuration 2, the offsite financial protection requirements set forth in 10 CFR 140.11 would be reduced from $200 million to $100 million for the primary liability coverage, and the licensee would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary liability coverage under Price-Anderson.    In Reactor Configuration 3, when all the spent fuel has been removed to an onsite or offsite dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository and the onsite radioactive inventory is greater than 1000 gallons, the onsite insurance coverage requirements would be $50 million under the proposed 10 CFR 50.54(w). This amount is based on the fact that there are still mobile radioactive sources onsite that have the potential to contaminate the site. The maximum cleanup costs associated with Reactor Configuration 3 are estimated at approximately $50 million. The conservative limiting event is the rupture of a large contaminated liquid storage tank that causes soil contamination and the potential to contaminate groundwater. The offsite financial protection requirements under the proposed Section 140.11 would be reduced from $100 million to $50 million, and the licensee would not be required to maintain secondary liability coverage under the Price-Anderson Act for Reactor Configuration 3. With no spent fuel in the spent fuel pool, the risks of offsite contamination have been reduced considerably for this configuration.    In Reactor Configuration 4, there are no significant mobile sources of radioactivity, such as liquid contaminants, onsite. Thus, the potential for onsite and offsite radiological impacts is limited. In this situation, onsite insurance coverage requirements either would be $25 million or would be completely eliminated under the proposed 10 CFR 50.54(w). The amount in each case would be based on information provided by the licensee and evaluated by the staff for the particular circumstances of the shutdown reactor. The $25 million onsite insurance coverage would be required if liquid radwaste remained stored onsite, usually 1,000 gallons or less of radwaste, that may be susceptible to an accidental spill and the consequent need for cleanup of the contaminated site. Elimination of required onsite insurance coverage would be based on the licensee's submittal of its terminal radiation survey to the NRC stating that the site has been cleaned to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license. In either case, the onsite and offsite consequences would be negligible.    In Reactor Configuration 4, the required offsite financial protection would be reduced to $25 million to account for the continuing potential for claims based on asserted offsite consequences. A minimum of $25 million in coverage would minimize the possibility that Federal Government indemnification would be required and would be consistent with the requirements of Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act that power reactor licensees maintain some level of public liability financial protection. The licensee would not be required to maintain secondary liability coverage under Price-Anderson for Reactor Configuration 4.    In addition, ""rated capacity"" would be addressed in 10 CFR Part 140 to indicate that permanently shutdown nuclear power plants have ""zero"" rated capacity. The effect of this amendment would be to allow the NRC to permit reduction of the primary liability coverage and elimination of the requirement for participation in the secondary liability coverage for nuclear power plants that had made the certifications under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(1)(i) and (ii). However, for reasons stated above, the NRC does not propose to permit this reduction and withdrawal until a reactor has entered the Reactor Configuration 2. At that point the NRC proposes that the reactor no longer be subject to the requirements to maintain primary financial protection in the ""maximum amount available at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms from private sources"" or to participate in the secondary financial protection public liability system under Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act. The Commission has already approved, in response to site-specific requests, these adjustments in the primary and secondary public liability insurance regime, and this clarification in Part 140, as requested by the Commission, places into the Commission's regulations a statement that a permanently shutdown nuclear power plant is no longer considered to have any ""rated capacity.""    The petition for rulemaking submitted by the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission would be substantially granted in that the insurance requirements would be significantly reduced, as requested. However, the petition could not be been fully granted because of the Price-Anderson statutory provisions that do not allow licensees who continue to hold 10 CFR Part 50 licenses to drop the offsite public liability coverage entirely.    Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability    The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The proposed rule change would allow licensees to seek reductions in onsite and offsite insurance coverage following permanent shutdown if they meet specified reactor configurations because of the reduced risk associated with permanently shutdown reactors. The proposed rule change would require no changes in hardware, procedures, organization, or operation of nuclear power reactors. It would not affect the safety requirements for nuclear power reactors because of the significantly reduced risks to the public health and safety in Reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 and it would not affect the likelihood, magnitude, or consequences of accidents at the permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors. Although the proposed rule change would reduce the level of financial protection available to pay for environmental or other consequences that may result from accidents at permanently shutdown nuclear power reactors, the Commission considers the reduced required insurance and financial protection coverage to be fully adequate and commensurate with the reduced consequences of potential accidents at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors and that the environment will not be negatively affected. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the proposed rulemaking would have no significant impacts on the quality of the environment.    The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact are available from George Mencinsky, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone (301) 415-6206.    Paperwork Reduction Act Statement    This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150-0011.    Public Protection Notification    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.    Regulatory Analysis    The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained from George Mencinsky, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone (301) 415-6206.    The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the ADDRESSES heading.    Regulatory Flexibility Certification    As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule only affects NRC power reactor licensees, which are not ""small entities.""    Backfit Analysis    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule because the backfit rule is limited in scope to construction and operation of nuclear reactors. This rule would only apply to reactors that have permanently ceased operations. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Regulatory Analysis for Rulemaking    on    Financial Protection Requirements for    Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    1. INTRODUCTION    NRC has issued a Rulemaking Plan for amending its current financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown (PSD) nuclear power reactors. (1)  This Plan complements other amendments for decommissioning, published in the  Federal Register  (61  FR  39278) on July 29, 1996, clarifying the procedures that lead to permanent shutdown and eventually to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors. Under that rule, ""permanent shutdown"" would become a codified status of a reactor when a licensee has certified that all fuel has been removed from the reactor core and that it has permanently ceased power operations.    NRC's Rulemaking Plan responds to NRC's experience in implementing the current financial protection requirements for PSD reactors. To date, five PSD reactor licensees have requested and been granted exemptions reducing their coverage under these requirements. The staff believes that the factors supporting these five exemptions including, in particular, the reduced risk associated with PSD reactors, are applicable to PSD reactors on a more generic basis. (2)    With regard to the issue of financial protection requirements for PSD nuclear power reactors, NRC is currently studying several regulatory options. This document presents NRC's Regulatory Analysis of these options.    1.1 Statement of the Problem and Objective of the Rulemaking    NRC has determined that there is a need to modify its existing regulations for insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors. These regulations currently specify the same on-site and off-site financial protection requirements regardless of whether a power reactor is permanently shutdown or operating, and thus do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with PSD plants. Rather, reduced insurance coverage for these plants has traditionally been allowed on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process. In addition, the existing requirements for off-site financial protection apply to power reactors with a specified ""rated capacity"" in terms of electrical kilowatts but do not account for the fact that PSD reactors no longer operate at any rated capacity.    The primary objective of the current rulemaking is to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. To accomplish this objective, NRC is proposing to allow licensees to reduce the level of required on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. NRC is also proposing to modify use of the term ""rated capacity"" to address indemnity for permanently shutdown plants.    1.2 Current Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    NRC's current requirements pertaining to financial protection for PSD nuclear power reactors are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage from private sources to provide protection against  on-site  damage in the event of an accident. Specifically, licensees must obtain insurance having    "". . . a minimum coverage limit for each reactor station site of either $1.06 billion or whatever amount of insurance is generally available from private sources, whichever is less.""    In the event of an accident, the proceeds from this insurance must be used first to stabilize the reactor and then to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site.    According to 10 CFR 140.11, licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity (i.e., those with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more) must have and maintain two levels of financial protection against off-site liability:    (1)  Primary insurance coverage  of $200 million from private sources; and    (2)  Secondary financial protection  in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan.    The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in the industry retrospective rating plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. In total, the financial protection for off-site liability for any incident equals the primary layer of $200 million plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher. This coverage currently amounts to approximately $8 billion.    2. IDENTIFICATION AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES    The Rulemaking Plan for this rulemaking identified two specific options, in addition to a no-action alternative, to address the issues discussed in Section 1.1. These options are discussed below.    2.1 Option 1    Under Option 1, the no-action alternative, NRC would maintain on-site insurance coverage requirements and off-site financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown (PSD) nuclear power reactors as prescribed by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11. Power reactor licensees would continue to be required to maintain coverage at the levels specified in the regulations during permanent shutdown. For each power reactor, this would require  on-site  insurance coverage in the amount of $1.06 billion or, if that level of coverage is not available, the maximum amount that is generally available from private sources, and  off-site  liability coverage consisting of (1) a primary layer of $200 million and (2) a secondary layer of $75.5 million times the total number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity at or above 100,000 kWe.    Under Option 1, PSD power reactor licensees would have the opportunity to request an exemption from the above requirements on a case-by-case basis if they believe that the above amount of financial coverage required of licensees would be more than necessary based on the level of perceived risk. A number of licensees already have used this process to obtain regulatory relief (see Table 2-1 below). While exemptions could continue to provide regulatory relief in the future, NRC believes that Option 1 would do so with less regulatory certainty than Options 2 and 3 discussed below. In addition, NRC believes that Option 1 may result in inconsistencies among licensees and would result in higher costs to both the licensee population and NRC because of the cost inefficiencies of dealing with the exemption issue on an individual plant basis.    Table 2-1 - Financial Protection Exemptions Currently in Effect at PSD Plants       Plant   On-Site Insurance Coverage ($million)   Primary Off-Site Financial Protection ($million)   Secondary Off-Site Financial Protection ($million)       Rancho Seco   50   100   0       LaCrosse   180   30.6   0       Yankee-Rowe   5   100   0       Humboldt Bay   63.2   50   0       Trojan   5   100   0        2.2 Option 2    Under this option, NRC would adjust the on-site insurance coverage requirements and the off-site financial protection requirements on a generic basis for PSD reactors. Adjusted coverage levels would be based on the spent fuel cladding temperatures that would result from accidents involving the loss of spent fuel pool water and the amount of liquid radioactive waste stored onsite in post-shutdown modes. Option 2 would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their insurance coverage and financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. The insurance coverage requirements proposed under Option 2 are based on the estimated costs resulting from hypothetical events for four different reactor configurations (described below). These costs may include on-site costs of recovery (i.e., stabilization and decontamination) and claims by members of the public for off-site consequences from nuclear energy hazards. (3)    Option 2 would also modify 10 CFR 140.11 to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. The effect of this modification would be that, once a shutdown reactor's spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool, the licensee would be allowed to (1) reduce its primary off-site financial protection level and (2) cease its participation in the secondary financial protection system under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4). This rule change would not require licensees to carry the full primary and secondary insurance once the certification under §50.82 has been made for permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel.    As noted above, several different configurations for PSD reactors have been established that encompass anticipated spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. These configurations are discussed in the following sections, along with the levels of on-site and off-site coverage that Option 2 would require for each configuration. A key distinction between NRC's existing coverage levels and the coverage levels proposed under Option 2 (as well as Option 3) is that, whereas the existing requirements apply on a  per-site  basis, the proposed requirements would apply on a  per-reactor  basis.    2.2.1 Reactor Configuration 1    In reactor Configuration 1, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, but spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the water in the pool is lost. This configuration encompasses the period commencing immediately after the offload of the core and ending just prior to when the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough so that no rapid zircaloy oxidation would take place and the fuel cladding would remain intact in the event of loss of water from the spent fuel pool. NRC's preliminary analysis indicates that, in order to prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy cladding fire given the loss of all spent fuel pool water, the resulting rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565C. NRC's analysis also estimates that, for typical reactors, the spent fuel would be sufficiently cool so as to prevent the cladding temperature from exceeding 565C in the event of a loss of all spent fuel pool water after a decay period of approximately 7 months for BWRs and approximately 17 months for PWRs. Once a sufficient cooling period for the spent fuel has elapsed after reactor shutdown, the potential zircaloy cladding fire sequence would no longer be a concern because, in an emergency situation, air would cool the spent fuel sufficiently to avoid zircaloy cladding combustion.    During reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain on-site insurance coverage and off-site financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.    2.2.2 Reactor Configuration 2    In reactor Configuration 2, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the pool is drained accidentally. In this configuration, the spent fuel can be stored on a long-term basis in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. However, the possibility exists for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and the site may contain a significantly large inventory of liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.    During reactor Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce both their on-site and off-site financial protection coverage as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Specifically, for a reactor in Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $50 million to recover from a fuel handling accident or a release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. However, licensees would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer provided under the Price-Anderson Act.    The proposed insurance coverage requirements for reactor Configuration 2 do not allow for periodic adjustments to account for the reduction in radioactive decay of the spent fuel assemblies with the passage of time. Rather, the insurance coverage requirements are based on the conservative assumption of a fuel handling accident shortly after the transition from reactor Configuration 1 to reactor Configuration 2. NRC believes that adjusting the insurance requirements during reactor Configuration 2 based on the decay level of the spent fuel would be burdensome from a regulatory standpoint in comparison to selecting a bounding figure to encompass any unexpected events concerning the spent fuel pool.    2.2.3 Reactor Configuration 3    In reactor Configuration 3, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and will include liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. For this configuration, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily focused on mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors.    For a reactor in Configuration 3, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $50 million (the same level as in reactor Configuration 2), if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a large (i.e., greater than 1,000 gallons), slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. The off-site requirement is reduced from that required in reactor Configuration 2 because the liability risk is considered to be less in reactor Configuration 3. As in reactor Configuration 2, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    2.2.4 Reactor Configuration 4    In reactor Configuration 4, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high-level repository. Unlike reactor Configuration 3, however, the reactor site has only a small amount (i.e., less than 1,000 gallons) of mobile sources of radioactivity (e.g., contaminated liquids) onsite. Finally, reactor Configuration 4 also covers the period during which the licensee has cleaned the reactor site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license.    For a reactor in Configuration 4, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to the minimum amount of $25 million, if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a less-than-1,000-gallon, slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. This on-site coverage for the reactor may be eliminated, however, when the licensee is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $25 million, based on the potential for claims based upon asserted off-site consequences and to minimize the possibility that Federal indemnification would be required. As in reactor Configurations 2 and 3, however, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    2.3 Option 3    Under Option 3, licensees would be required to meet the same on-site insurance coverage requirements specified in Option 2 but would be allowed to reduce further their off-site financial protection requirements during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process. Specifically, Option 3 sets a de minimis level of liability insurance for off-site coverage on the order of $5 million to $10 million for reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4, as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Although this de minimis level reflects the fact that off-site radiological consequences are likely to be small, it would provide the Federal government with a minimal threshold of protection to financial risk from public indemnity claims from actual or perceived consequences.    Option 3 essentially endorses eliminating off-site financial protection requirements for permanently shutdown reactors in reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4, but maintains some required coverage to satisfy the legal requirements of the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act requires all Part 50 licensees to maintain some level of public liability financial protection coverage and requires the Federal government to assume responsibility for the liability claims that exceed that level of coverage. By reducing the off-site financial protection coverage under reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 to the $5 to $10 million range, licensees' insurance premiums would most likely be reduced, yielding a cost savings to licensees. However, on an expected value basis, Option 3 increases the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents. Furthermore, lowering the liability of licensees in the event of an accident could be problematic in terms of the public's perception.    3. ANALYSIS OF VALUES AND IMPACTS    This section examines the values and impacts expected to result from NRC's rulemaking, and is presented in three subsections. Section 3.1 identifies attributes that are expected to be affected by the rulemaking. Section 3.2 describes the analytical model used to quantify values and impacts. Finally, the proposal's effects on values and impacts are presented in Section 3.3.    3.1 Identification of Affected Attributes    This section identifies and describes the factors within the public and private sectors that the regulatory alternatives (discussed in Section 2) are expected to affect. These factors were classified as ""attributes,"" using the list of potential attributes provided by NRC in Chapter 5 of its  Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook . (4)  Each attribute listed in Chapter 5 was evaluated, and the basis for selecting those attributes expected to be affected by the proposed action is presented in the balance of this section.    The proposed rule would revise the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements that support requirements for facility operation/shutdown and license termination. The insurance coverage and financial protection requirements are designed to provide financial protection both onsite and offsite in the event of an accident at a reactor. They do not create or define the operation/shutdown and termination activities themselves. Therefore, some of the following attributes either are not consequences of the proposed action or are potential secondary consequences properly attributable not to the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements but to the facility operation/shutdown and license termination requirements that the protection requirements support. The attributes in this group include the following:    Public Health (Accident) -- No changes to radiation exposures to the public within 50 miles of a facility are expected due to changes in accident frequencies or accident consequences associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to address accident frequency or consequences.    Public Health (Routine) -- No changes to radiation exposures to the public during normal facility operations are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action does not affect routine facility operations in any manner that could result in radiation exposures to the public.    Occupational Health (Accident) -- No changes to health effects, both immediate and long-term, associated with site workers as a result of changes in accident frequency or accident mitigation are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to affect accident frequency or consequences.    Occupational Health (Routine) -- No changes to radiological exposures to workers during normal facility operations are expected to be associated with the proposed action because the action is not designed or expected to affect routine facility operations in any manner that could result in radiation exposures to workers.    Off-site Property -- No changes to monetary effects on off-site property, either through changes in accident frequency and consequences or in other direct or indirect forms, are expected to be associated with the proposed action. The action is not designed or expected to affect accident frequency or consequences. Effects on off-site property resulting from operation/shutdown and license termination are considered an attribute of the operation/shutdown and license termination requirements and not of the financial protection requirements.    On-site Property -- No changes to monetary effects on on-site property, either through changes in accident frequency and consequences or in other direct or indirect forms, are expected to be associated with the proposed action. The action is not designed or expected to affect the need for replacement power, decontamination, or refurbishment costs. Effects on on-site property resulting from operation/shutdown and license termination are considered an attribute of the operation/shutdown and license termination requirements and not of the financial protection requirements.    Industry Implementation -- The proposed action would require licensees to alter the coverages of existing insurance policies in order to achieve the operational savings discussed below. However, the effort required to alter insurance coverages is not believed to be of any significance.    NRC Implementation -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on NRC implementation, assuming that no Regulatory Guides will have to be proposed or revised.    Antitrust Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any antitrust effects.    Safeguards and Security Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on the existing level of safeguards and security.    Environmental Considerations -- The proposed action is not expected to have any effect on the existing level of protection of environmental considerations.    The proposed regulatory actions are expected to involve the following attributes:    Industry Operation -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), the proposed rule changes in Option 2 and Option 3 would result in industry operation savings for licensees. Specifically, under either Option 2 or Option 3, licensees attempting to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements following plant shutdown would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC. In addition, licensees potentially would realize annual savings in the form of reduced insurance premiums.    NRC Operation -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), the proposed rule changes in Option 2 and Option 3 would result in industry operation savings for NRC. Specifically, under either Option 2 or Option 3, NRC would avoid the costs of reviewing and evaluating submissions from licensees attempting to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements.    Other Government -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), Option 2 and Option 3 would result in impacts to the Federal government in that they would increase the government's indemnity risk associated with accidents at PSD reactor facilities. This risk, which is believed to be insignificant for Option 2 and significant for Option 3, has not been quantified in this analysis.    Regulatory Efficiency -- Relative to the no-action option (Option 1), Option 2 and Option 3 would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency, particularly by eliminating the need for preparation, submission, and review of individual plant exemption requests. In addition, Option 2 and Option 3 would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These values, while believed to be significant, have not been quantified in this analysis.    3.2 Model Design    This section describes the general methods used to structure the analysis and calculate results. The quantifiable results of the analysis (see Section 3.3) are based primarily on modeled effects of the proposed rule on (1) the costs of preparing, submitting, and reviewing exemption requests and (2) insurance premium data for nuclear power reactor licensees. Although the rulemaking would also result in significantly enhanced regulatory efficiency (see Section 3.1), these values have not been quantified.    The discussion in this section is divided into three parts. Section 3.2.1 summarizes the development of the database used in the analysis. Section 3.2.2 describes the methodology that was used to model the regulatory options under consideration. Finally, Section 3.2.3 discusses key assumptions that were used in the analysis.    3.2.1 Development of the Database    To help quantify the effects of the proposed rule, a database was developed containing a variety of data on nuclear power reactors and the licensees that own and operate these reactors. These data were obtained from the following two sources:    Nuclear Regulatory Commission Information Digest . (5)  The  Information Digest  provided reactor-specific information including licensee, unit name and type, location, operating status, operating license expiration date, licensed MWt, and decommissioning method (for shutdown reactors).    Annual Survey of Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Estimates and Funding Policies, Public Utility Survey . (6)  The  Annual Survey  provided reactor-specific information on license expiration dates and the expected timing and method of decommissioning.    The database includes information on a total of 74 reactor station sites, at which there are 109 operating reactors and 12 shutdown reactors. Of the 74 sites, 35 sites have only one reactor (whether operating or shutdown), 31 sites have two reactors, and 8 sites have three reactors. The database excludes reactors that (1) are not of the PWR or BWR type, (2) have been fully decommissioned, or (3) are not yet operational. However, the database does include NRC-regulated reactors that have already shutdown but have not been fully decommissioned.    3.2.2 Modeling of Regulatory Options    This section describes how each of the regulatory options under consideration has been modeled to quantify values and impacts associated with the options' insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. Option 1 is the no-action alternative and, as such, would have no values or impacts to be estimated. As a result, this discussion will focus on the modeling of Options 2 and 3. Under Options 2 and 3, NRC would allow power reactor licensees to modify their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on four different reactor configurations that follow permanent shutdown. In addition, NRC would clarify the definition of ""rated capacity"" to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero.    The requirements envisioned in Options 2 and 3 are deregulatory in nature and would affect licensees in two ways. First, because licensees would be able to reduce their financial protection coverage without resorting to the exemption process, licensees would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC to obtain exemptions from the current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. (7)  Second, licensees potentially would realize savings over time in the form of reduced annual insurance premiums associated with the modified insurance coverage and financial protection requirements. The proposed requirements in Options 2 and 3 also would benefit NRC in that NRC would avoid the costs of reviewing and evaluating exemption packages submitted by licensees.    The proposed rule changes under Options 2 and 3 would also result in values and impacts that are not quantified in this analysis. In particular, the proposed requirements would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency because they would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. On the other hand, relative to both the no-action option and Option 2, Option 3 significantly increases the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities.    As noted above, both licensees and NRC would realize cost savings under Options 2 and 3 because the proposed rulemaking would eliminate the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process in order to reduce their insurance coverage and financial protection requirements following permanent shutdown. For licensees, these cost savings are calculated by multiplying the time required to prepare and submit exemption packages (in hours) for each reactor station site by the hourly wage rate for licensee staff. For NRC, these cost savings are calculated by multiplying the time required to review and evaluate exemption packages (in hours) by the hourly wage rate for NRC staff.    In addition, Options 2 and 3 potentially would generate cost savings to licensees due to reduced insurance premiums from the beginning of reactor Configuration 2 through the end of decommissioning. These potential cost savings are modeled in four general steps:    Step 1: The present value of the insurance premiums that licensees would have paid under the existing insurance coverage and financial protection requirements is calculated. (8)    Step 2: For each of the reactor configurations during which licensees would be able to reduce their insurance coverage (i.e., reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4), the present value of the premiums that licensees would pay under the proposed rule is calculated.    Step 3: The premiums that licensees would pay under reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 (calculated in Step 2) are added to yield the total premiums paid by licensees under the proposed rule.    Step 4: The sum from Step 3 is subtracted from the total calculated in Step 1 to yield the total discounted cost savings to licensees from the proposed rule.    A critical variable in the methodology described above is the insurance premium paid by licensees for on-site and off-site coverage. For this analysis, data on insurance premiums were obtained from two sources. The first source, an article by Kurland (1993), provides 1992 data on the annual premiums charged by three different nuclear insurers -- American Nuclear Insurers, Nuclear Material Limited, and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited. (9)  Data are provided for various amounts of both on-site and off-site coverage and, in some cases, are broken out into premiums for single-reactor sites and multiple-reactor sites. The second source used to obtain data on insurance premiums, SECY-96-256, provides data on the annual insurance premiums that would apply to various levels of off-site liability coverage. (10)    The insurance premium figures used in this analysis were derived by fitting quadratic regression curves to the data from the two sources listed above. A total of four curves were developed, three for on-site coverage and one for off-site coverage. (11)  Quadratic, rather than linear, regressions were chosen to reflect that insurance premiums tend to increase at a decreasing rate as the level of coverage increases.    3.2.3 Assumptions    Several assumptions were used in conducting the analysis described above. Key assumptions include the following:        The analysis assumes that the proposed rule would become effective in April 1998. Based on this assumption, all future costs and cost savings are discounted back to April 1998, using a 7 percent discount rate. (12)  All dollar amounts in the analysis are stated in 1997 dollars. (13)     NRC's Rulemaking Plan indicates that, under Option 3, the off-site financial protection requirement for reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4 would be on the order of $5 million to $10 million. For simplicity, the analysis assumes that the required level of off-site coverage under Option 3 for these three configurations is $7.5 million.     Because the proposed insurance coverage and financial protection requirements under Options 2 and 3 apply on a per-reactor basis, the analysis treats each reactor on a multiple-reactor site as an independent unit, with its own spent fuel pool and its own insurance policies. In addition, the analysis assumes that the 1,000-gallon on-site radioactive-liquid-inventory threshold that governs the transition from reactor Configuration 3 to reactor Configuration 4 is applicable to each reactor on a multiple-reactor site (as opposed to the entire site as a whole).     Information provided in the  Information Digest  or the  Annual Survey  indicates that, for eight of the 39 sites with multiple reactors, one or more reactors at the site is/are being or will be decommissioned using the SAFSTOR method while the remaining reactor(s) will be decommissioned using the DECON method. In six of these eight cases, the sources indicate that the reactors using SAFSTOR will be kept in safe storage until the reactors using DECON have ceased operations and are ready for decommissioning. This analysis assumes that the same situation would apply in the remaining two cases.     The DECON or SAFSTOR process for a given power reactor is assumed to begin at the time the reactor ceases operation (i.e., the operating license expiration date). Also, the analysis assumes that no licenses will be renewed at expiration.     Based on NRC's decommissioning analysis for BWRs, (14)  the analysis assumes that the DECON and SAFSTOR methods of decommissioning for BWRs last 6.3 years and 60 years, respectively, following power reactor shutdown. For each of these methods, spent fuel is stored in the cooling pools for a period of 4.6 years.     Based on NRC's decommissioning analysis for PWRs, (15)  the analysis assumes that the DECON and SAFSTOR methods of decommissioning for PWRs last 8.62 years and 60 years, respectively, following power reactor shutdown. For each of these methods, spent fuel is stored in the cooling pools for a period of 6.92 years.     Based on NRC's preliminary analysis, reactor Configuration 1 (i.e., the period between operating license expiration and the time at which the spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool) is assumed to last 0.58 years (or 7 months) for BWRs and 1.42 years (or 17 months) for PWRs.     Reactor Configuration 2 (i.e., the period between the end of reactor Configuration 1 and the time at which the spent fuel is removed from the cooling pools) is assumed to last 4.02 years for BWRs and 5.5 years for PWRs. (16)     For reactors using DECON, reactor Configuration 3 (i.e., the time between the end of reactor Configuration 2 and the time at which the on-site radioactive liquid inventory falls to below 1,000 gallons) is assumed to cover 75 percent of the period between the end of the pool storage period and the end of decommissioning. For reactors using SAFSTOR, reactor Configuration 3 is assumed to cover the entire extended safe storage period plus 75 percent of the remaining decommissioning period.     For reactors using DECON or SAFSTOR, reactor Configuration 4 (i.e., the period between the end of reactor Configuration 3 and the end of decommissioning) is divided into two parts. For the first 80 percent of the Configuration 4 period, the on-site radioactive liquid inventory is assumed to be between 0 and 1,000 gallons. For the final 20 percent of the Configuration 4 period, the analysis assumes that there are no radioactive liquids onsite, and the licensee is merely awaiting/undergoing a confirmatory survey.     Based on information provided in SECY-96-256, the analysis assumes that 90 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions from the current financial protection requirements would seek exemptions in the absence of the proposed rule. For sites with active reactors, the analysis assumes that these exemptions would be submitted immediately following shutdown of the last reactor on the site. For sites with shutdown reactors only (excluding the five sites that already have exemptions), the analysis assumes that exemptions would be submitted at the time the proposed rule becomes effective (i.e., April 1998). For purposes of sensitivity analysis, the model also calculates results assuming that 100 percent of licensees would seek exemptions in the absence of the rule.     Based on the on-site and off-site coverage levels that currently apply to the five reactor sites that have already been through the exemption process (see Table 2-1), the analysis assumes on-site and off-site coverage levels of $75 million and $100 million, respectively, for sites obtaining exemptions. As a sensitivity on this assumption, the analysis also considers on-site and off-site exemption levels of $50 million and $75 million, respectively, and $25 million and $50 million, respectively.     The wage rates applicable to NRC staff and licensee staff are assumed to be $68.28 per hour and $73.56 per hour, respectively. These rates were calculated from 1996 wage rates developed by NRC for use in regulatory analyses of $67.50 per hour for NRC staff and $72.72 for licensee staff. The 1996 wage rates were converted to 1997 dollars to be compatible with the use of 1997 dollars in the balance of the analysis.     Based on information provided in SECY-96-256, the level of effort required by a licensee to prepare and submit an exemption request for a particular site is assumed to be 160 hours. The level of effort required by NRC to review and evaluate an exemption request for a particular site is assumed to be 120 hours.      3.3 Results    The results of the analysis for each of the affected attributes identified in Section 3.1 are shown below in Exhibit 3-1, including (1) the qualitative results for Regulatory Efficiency (i.e., greater regulatory certainty, more consistent treatment of licensees, and elimination of delays associated with the exemption process) and Other Government (i.e., increased indemnity risk) and (2) the quantitative results for Industry Operation (i.e., exemption cost savings and potential insurance premium savings) and NRC Operation (i.e., exemption cost savings). As shown in the exhibit, there are no values or impacts associated with Option 1 (the no-action alternative). Rather, during the shutdown period, licensees would continue to maintain on-site and off-site financial protection coverage in the amounts prescribed by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, and would need to resort to the exemption process in order to reduce this coverage.    Option 2 would result in increases in regulatory efficiency relative to the no-action option. In particular, Option 2 would provide greater regulatory certainty than the no-action option, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These increases in regulatory efficiency have not been quantified but are believed to be significant. Under Option 2, elimination of the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process to reduce their financial protection coverage levels is expected to save licensees $202,000 in preparation and submission costs and to save NRC $141,000 in review and evaluation costs. In addition, the proposed changes to the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for PSD reactors potentially could save licensees on the order of $48 million in insurance premiums over the period from shutdown through the end of decommissioning. It is important to note, however, that this $48 million savings assumes that 10 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions would not seek exemptions following shutdown, even though seeking exemptions would likely reduce their costs. To the extent that all licensees would pursue exemptions from the current coverage requirements, savings from Option 2 would fall by 75 percent to $12 million. Also, the amount of potential savings is sensitive to the assumption regarding the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements. (17)  Finally, due to the reduced coverage levels that would be allowed under Option 2, the indemnity risk to the Federal government would increase. This increase in risk has not been quantified but is believed to be insignificant because the coverage levels established under Option 2 represent NRC's best estimate of the on-site and off-site consequences that could result from accidents during each of the four reactor configurations following shutdown.    Option 3, like Option 2, would result in increases in regulatory efficiency relative to the no-action option in that it would provide greater regulatory certainty, would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. These increases in regulatory efficiency have not been quantified but are believed to be significant. Option 3 would also eliminate the need for licensees to resort to the exemption process to reduce their coverage levels, thereby generating an expected savings to licensees of $202,000 in preparation and submission costs, and savings to NRC of $141,000 in review and evaluation costs (i.e., the same as in Option 2). In addition, the proposed rule changes in Option 3 potentially could save licensees approximately $98 million in insurance premiums over the period from shutdown through the end of decommissioning. Several points concerning this $98 million savings are worth noting. First, as with the insurance premium savings estimates for Option 2, this $98 million savings is based on the assumption that 10 percent of licensees at sites without exemptions would not seek exemptions following shutdown. To the extent that all licensees would pursue exemptions from the current coverage requirements, approximately 37 percent of these savings would not be realized. Second, as in Option 2, the amount of potential savings is sensitive to the assumption regarding the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements. Finally, even though Option 3 potentially could result in an additional $50 million in insurance premium savings to licensees relative to Option 2 (due to the fact that the off-site financial protection requirements under Option 3 are significantly lower than in Option 2), these additional savings would be at the expense of increased impacts to the Federal government. This is because the reduced coverage levels under Option 3 increase the likelihood that the Federal government would have to bear some of the financial risk associated with accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities. This increase in risk has not been quantified but is believed to be significant.

BACKFIT ANALYSIS    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule, and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule, because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), nor do they impose more stringent safety requirements on 10 CFR Part 50 licensees.    5. DECISION RATIONALE    1. Option 1, the no-action alternative, would retain the existing requirements for on-site and off-site financial protection for PSD reactors. Both Option 2 and Option 3 would allow power reactor licensees to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on four different reactor configurations that are anticipated following permanent shutdown. In addition, both options would clarify the definition of ""rated capacity"" to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. Both Option 2 and Option 3 are expected to result in cost savings for licensees and NRC. First, the proposed requirements under Options 2 and 3 would result in enhanced regulatory efficiency because they would provide greater regulatory certainty than Option 1 (the no-action alternative), would ensure consistent treatment among all power reactor licensees, and would eliminate the potential for costly delays in effecting regulatory exemptions. Second, because licensees would be able to reduce their financial protection coverage without resorting to the exemption process, licensees wishing to reduce their current financial protection requirements would avoid the costs of preparing and submitting exemption packages to NRC, which could amount to approximately $202,000 (present value). This would benefit NRC in that NRC would avoid costs of approximately $141,000 (present value) for reviewing and evaluating exemption packages submitted by licensees. Finally, licensees potentially would realize savings over time in the form of reduced annual insurance premiums associated with the modified coverage levels that would be required under the proposed rule. The present value of these savings could amount to between $48 million (for Option 2) and $98 million (for Option 3), assuming that 90 percent of licensees would seek exemptions from the current requirements following shutdown. If, on the other hand, all licensees obtained exemptions following shutdown, these savings would be significantly smaller ($12 million and $62 million for Options 2 and 3, respectively). Insurance premium savings could also be smaller depending on the on-site and off-site coverage levels that would apply under exemptions from the current requirements.    2. The only distinction between Option 2 and Option 3 is that Option 3 would allow licensees to reduce their off-site financial protection requirements to levels significantly lower than those allowed under Option 2. However, this option significantly increases the financial risk associated with accidents that the Federal government would have to bear. NRC believes that the coverage levels established under Option 2 represent NRC's best estimate of the on-site and off-site consequences that could result from accidents during each of the four reactor configurations following shutdown. As a result, NRC believes that the further reduction in off-site coverage levels under Option 3 jeopardizes the financial protection requirements, despite the potential for an additional insurance premium savings to licensees of approximately $50 million (i.e., $98 million minus $48 million). Finally, NRC believes that a further reduction of the liability of licensees in the event of an accident could be problematic in terms of the public's perception.    3. For the reasons stated in (1) and (2) above, Option 2 is superior to Option 1 (the no-action alternative) and Option 3.    6. IMPLEMENTATION    This action would be enacted through a Proposed Rule Notice and public comment and a Final Rule, with promulgation of the Final Rule expected by April 1998. Implementation can begin immediately following the enactment of the final rulemaking. No impediments to implementation of the recommended alternative have been identified. In addition, no Regulatory Guides for licensees are expected to be needed.      Draft Environmental Assessment    and Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact    Proposed Rule: Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors    This document fulfills NRC's obligation under 10 CFR Part 51 to examine the environmental impacts of its regulatory actions, in this case in regard to a rulemaking addressing NRC's current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors. NRC is proposing to modify these requirements, which are contained in 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, on a generic basis for permanently shutdown (PSD) reactors to account for the reduced risk associated with these reactors.    NRC's regulations for implementing Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, are contained in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51. These regulations require that an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment be prepared for all licensing and regulatory actions that are not classified as ""categorical exclusions"" under 10 CFR 51.22(c) and are not identified in 10 CFR 51.22(d) as other actions not requiring environmental review.    NRC has determined that, under Section 102(2) of NEPA, as amended, and NRC's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that the proposed rule modifying the insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for nuclear power reactors is not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and, therefore, that an environmental impact statement is not required. NRC has also determined that the proposed rule does not qualify as a categorical exclusion or other action not requiring environmental review. Consequently, NRC has determined that an environmental assessment is required. This document presents the results of NRC's environmental assessment of the proposed rule.    Background    Under 10 CFR 50.54(w), nuclear power reactor licensees must obtain insurance coverage in the amount of $1.06 billion (or, if that level of coverage is not available, the maximum amount that is generally available from private sources) to provide protection against  on-site  damage in the event of an accident at a reactor. In the event of an accident, the proceeds from this insurance must be used first to stabilize the reactor and then to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site. Under 10 CFR 140.11, licensees of facilities designed to produce substantial amounts of electricity (i.e., those with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or more) must have and maintain two levels of financial protection against  off-site  liability: (1) primary insurance coverage of $200 million from private sources, and (2) secondary financial protection in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan. (18)    In a staff requirements memorandum (SRM) dated July 13, 1993, the Commission approved staff recommendations to (1) allow licensees that have permanently shutdown to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer under the Price-Anderson Act (section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended), (2) reduce the required primary financial protection coverage under the Price-Anderson Act, through exemption, to $100 million after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period, and (3) proceed with a rulemaking to determine appropriate further reductions in the level of insurance coverage after the appropriate spent fuel cooling period. The Commission also requested that the staff determine whether there is a need for financial protection for ISFSIs and requested clarification of the term ""rated capacity,"" as applied to PSD reactors. In addition, the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission submitted a petition requesting a reduction in or elimination of the $1.06 billion in insurance for on-site reactor stabilization and accident decontamination, currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w), in instances when all nuclear fuel has been removed from the site. The petitioner also requested that the requirement for off-site primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.    In response to item 3 of the SRM (19)  and the petition from the North Carolina Public Staff Utilities Commission, the staff issued a Rulemaking Plan for amending NRC's current insurance coverage and financial protection requirements for PSD nuclear power reactors. (20)  This Plan complements other amendments for decommissioning, published in the  Federal Register  (61  FR  39278) on July 29, 1996, clarifying the procedures that lead to permanent shutdown and, eventually, to the termination of an operating license for nuclear power reactors. Under that rule, ""permanent shutdown"" would become a codified status of a reactor when a licensee has certified that all fuel has been removed from the reactor core and that it has permanently ceased power operations.    The Rulemaking Plan also responds to NRC's experience in implementing the current financial insurance coverage and protection requirements for PSD reactors. To date, five PSD reactor licensees have requested and been granted exemptions reducing their coverage under these requirements. The staff believes that the factors supporting these five exemptions including, in particular, the reduced risk associated with PSD reactors, are applicable to PSD reactors on a more generic basis.    Discussion    NRC's Rulemaking Plan is part of a broad effort to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens for power reactor facilities that are permanently shutdown and in the process of decommissioning. NRC has determined that there is a need to modify its existing insurance coverage and financial protection regulations for nuclear power reactors because these regulations currently specify the same on-site and off-site requirements regardless of whether a power reactor is permanently shutdown or operating, and thus do not take into consideration the reduced risk associated with PSD plants. Rather, reduced insurance coverage for these plants has traditionally been allowed on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process. In addition, the existing requirements for off-site financial protection apply to power reactors with a specified ""rated capacity"" in terms of electrical kilowatts but do not account for the fact that PSD reactors no longer operate at any rated capacity.    NRC is proposing to adjust the on-site insurance coverage requirements under 10 CFR 50.54(w) and the off-site financial protection requirements under 10 CFR 140.11 on a generic basis for PSD reactors. Specifically, NRC is proposing to allow power reactor licensees to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. (21)  These configurations and the associated coverage levels are described below:        Reactor Configuration 1: In this configuration, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, but spent fuel in the spent fuel pool is susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire if the water in the pool is lost. This configuration encompasses the period commencing immediately after the offload of the core and ending just prior to when the decay heat of the hottest assemblies is low enough so that no rapid zircaloy oxidation would take place and the fuel cladding would remain intact in the event of loss of water from the spent fuel pool. NRC's preliminary analysis indicates that, in order to prevent fuel rod cladding failure leading to a zircaloy cladding fire given the loss of all spent fuel pool water, the resulting rod cladding temperature must not exceed 565C. NRC's analysis also estimates that, for typical reactors, the spent fuel would be sufficiently cool so as to prevent the cladding temperature from exceeding 565C in the event of a loss of all spent fuel pool water after a decay period of approximately 7 months for BWRs and approximately 17 months for PWRs. Once a sufficient cooling period for the spent fuel has elapsed after reactor shutdown, the potential zircaloy cladding fire sequence would no longer be a concern because, in an emergency situation, air would cool the spent fuel sufficiently to avoid zircaloy cladding combustion.      During reactor Configuration 1, licensees would be required to maintain on-site insurance coverage and off-site financial protection at the levels currently required by 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11, respectively. This is because the radiological consequences during this stage of permanent shutdown approximate the magnitude of a severe core damage accident.        Reactor Configuration 2: In this configuration, the reactor is defueled and permanently shutdown, and spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool but is not susceptible to a zircaloy cladding fire or gap release caused by an incipient fuel cladding failure in the event the pool is drained accidentally. In reactor Configuration 2, the spent fuel can be stored on a long term basis in the spent fuel pool without the possibility of initiating a zircaloy fire or significant fuel cladding failure. However, the possibility exists for a fuel handling accident in the spent fuel pool, and the site may contain a significantly large inventory of liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. The radioactive inventory during this configuration may change depending on the licensee's proposed shutdown activities and schedule.      During reactor Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce both their on-site and off-site financial protection coverage as long as there are no operating reactors on the site. Specifically, for a reactor in Configuration 2, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $50 million to recover from a fuel handling accident or a release of cooling water from the spent fuel pool. Licensees would also be allowed to reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $100 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. However, licensees would be allowed to withdraw from the secondary financial protection layer provided under the Price-Anderson Act.        Reactor Configuration 3: In this configuration, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high level repository. The remaining radioactive inventory depends on the decommissioning status and will include liquid radioactive waste, activated reactor components, and contaminated structural materials. For this configuration, the potential for a radiological incident is primarily focused on mobile sources of radioactivity onsite at permanently shutdown nuclear reactors.      For a reactor in Configuration 3, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $50 million (to the same minimum level permitted under reactor Configuration 2), if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a large (i.e., greater than 1,000 gallons), slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. Licensees would also be allowed to further reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $50 million, based on the potential for significant judgments or settlements resulting from litigation and to protect the Federal government from indemnity claims. The off-site requirement is reduced from that required in reactor Configuration 2 because the liability risk is considered to be less in reactor Configuration 3. As in reactor Configuration 2, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.        Reactor Configuration 4: In this configuration, the reactor is permanently shutdown and no spent fuel is in the reactor or the spent fuel pool. All spent fuel has been removed to an off-site or on-site dry storage ISFSI or to a DOE high level repository. Unlike reactor Configuration 3, however, the reactor site has only a small amount (i.e., less than 1,000 gallons) of mobile sources of radioactivity (e.g., contaminated liquids) onsite. Finally, this configuration also covers the period during which the licensee has cleaned the reactor site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for termination of the license.      For a reactor in Configuration 4, licensees would be allowed to reduce their on-site insurance coverage to a minimum amount of $25 million, if there are no operating reactors on the site, to account for a rupture of a less-than-1,000-gallon, slightly-contaminated-liquid storage tank. This on-site coverage for the reactor may be eliminated, however, when the licensee has cleaned the site to unrestricted release levels and is awaiting a confirmatory survey for license termination. The Commission has issued a proposed License Termination Rule. If that rule becomes final it would prescribe the requirements that apply to establishment of funds that may be required at license termination. Licensees would also be allowed to further reduce their off-site financial protection to the amount of $25 million based on the continued potential for claims from asserted off-site consequences and to minimize the possibility that Federal indemnification would be required. As in reactor Configurations 2 and 3, the secondary financial protection layer would no longer be required.    NRC is also proposing to modify 10 CFR 140.11 to indicate that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero. The effect of this modification would be that, once a shutdown reactor's spent fuel has cooled to the point where the spent fuel cladding temperature would not exceed 565C in the event of a loss of water from the spent fuel pool, the licensee would be allowed to (1) reduce its primary off-site financial protection level and (2) cease its participation in the secondary financial protection system under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4).    Environmental Considerations    The proposed rule, if implemented by NRC, would reduce the burden of existing requirements on nuclear power reactor licensees by allowing them to reduce their on-site and off-site liability coverage, without resorting to the exemption process, based on several different reactor configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. The proposed rule would also clarify that a PSD nuclear power reactor has a rated capacity of zero.    The proposed regulatory changes, which apply only to nuclear power reactors that have permanently ceased operations, would require no changes in hardware, procedures, organization, or operation of nuclear power reactors. The proposed requirements would not affect the safety provided by NRC's requirements for nuclear power reactor operation/shutdown and license termination because of the significantly reduced risks to the public health and safety in reactor Configurations 2, 3, and 4. In addition, the proposed modifications would not affect the likelihood, magnitude, or consequences of accidents at nuclear power reactor facilities. While the modifications would reduce the levels of financial protection available under the regulations to pay for environmental or other consequences that may result from accidents at PSD reactors, NRC believes the reduced coverage levels are fully adequate and commensurate with the reduced consequences of potential accidents at PSD reactors and, therefore, that the environment will not be negatively affected. Based on these factors, NRC has determined that the proposed rulemaking would have no significant impacts on the quality of the environment.      The Honorable James M. Inhofe, Chairman  Subcommittee on Clean Air, Wetlands, Private Property and Nuclear Safety  Committee on Environment and Public Works  United States Senate  Washington, DC 20510    Dear Mr. Chairman:    The NRC has sent to the Office of the Federal Register for publication and comment the enclosed proposed amendments to the Commission's rules in    10 CFR Part 50 and 10 CFR Part 140. The amendments, if adopted, would specify levels of liability coverage that would be required of licensees that meet specified reactor configurations during permanent shutdown of nuclear power reactors. This would allow nuclear reactor licensees a reduction in onsite and offsite liability coverage during permanent shutdown without resorting to the exemption process.    The proposed rule would amend 10 CFR 50.54(w) to allow nuclear reactor licensees to lower the onsite insurance requirements based on several different configurations that encompass spent fuel characteristics and storage modes following permanent shutdown. In parallel, offsite financial protection requirements as specified in 10 CFR 140.11 would also be adjusted to allow licensees to lower their primary insurance coverage and be able to withdraw from the industry retrospective rating plan, based on satisfying the requirements specified for the same configurations during permanent shutdown. In addition, the proposed offsite insurance requirements would continue to provide the Federal Government protection from indemnity claims even though the NRC staff considers that such events would be rare and would have negligible offsite consequences.

The amendment is being proposed because of the reduced risks associated with a permanently shut down plant, after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period. Currently, licensees at permanently shut down facilities must request an exemption from the regulations in order to obtain a reduced level of insurance coverage. The proposed rule would eliminate the need for such an exemption.    Currently, licensees must obtain approximately $1 billion of insurance for each power reactor site to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor, and to provide coverage for onsite damage in the event of an accident. They are also required, under the Price-Anderson Act, to obtain a minimum of $200 million for financial protection and to participate in a secondary financial protection system against damages and injuries which could occur offsite.    Under the proposed rule, the amount of insurance coverage required onsite would be reduced downwards to $50 million or less, and the amount of coverage required offsite would be reduced to $100 million or less. These amounts would be based on certain configurations of the reactor and the spent fuel stored onsite. For instance, reactors with spent fuel in the storage pool and fuel that is still above a certain temperature would require more insurance than reactors that have no spent fuel in the pool because of the possibility of a fuel cladding fire if the pool is accidentally drained. In addition, sites with an inventory of liquid radioactive waste, radioactive reactor components, or contaminated structural material, may require higher insurance coverage than sites without such materials. The proposed rule does not address the financial protection reqirements for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). That subject will be addressed after efforts dealing with technical and licensing issues for ISFSIs.    The proposed rule will be published for comment shortly in the Federal Register.

The petitioner also requested that the requirement for off-site primary and secondary liability coverages required under 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) be reduced or eliminated for shutdown reactors when no nuclear fuel is on the reactor site.      3  Experience from the accident at TMI-2 has shown that significant settlements can be involved even though the off-site consequences may be negligible.      4   Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook, Final Report , NUREG/BR-0184, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, January 1997.      5   Nuclear Regulatory Commission Information Digest , NUREG-1350, Volume 7, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of the Comptroller, March 1995.      6   Annual Survey of Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Estimates and Funding Policies, Public Utility Survey , Goldman Sachs, August 1995, Table 32. (A more recent version of this survey is not currently available.)      7  While these cost savings can be quantified, these values actually are attributable to the proposed options only indirectly because licensees are not currently required to obtain exemptions for their PSD reactors.      8  The insurance premiums that would be paid by licensees under the current rule reflect the assumption that 90 percent (and, for sensitivity analysis purposes, 100 percent) of licensees at sites without exemptions would obtain exemptions following shutdown. In addition, for the five PSD reactors that have already been through the exemption process (i.e., Humboldt Bay 3, LaCrosse, Rancho Seco, Trojan, Yankee-Rowe), the combined on-site and off-site insurance coverage limits applicable to those reactors are assumed to either stay the same or decline depending on whether the combined on-site and off-site insurance coverage limits in the proposed rule are higher or lower than those currently in effect for those reactors.      9  Kurland, Orin M., ""Who the nuclear insurers are,""  Risk Management , vol. 40, no. 6, June 1993, p. 44.      10  SECY-96-256, ""Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11,"" December 17, 1996.      11  The three curves for on-site coverage were used to derive insurance premium estimates for sites with one reactor, two reactors, and three reactors, respectively. Only one curve was developed for off-site coverage because the data on premiums for this type of coverage did not reflect variation based on the number of reactors at a site.      12  A discount rate of 7 percent was used in accordance with NRC's  Regulatory Analysis Technical Evaluation Handbook,  January 1997, page B-2.      13  To convert dollar figures to 1997 dollars, the analysis uses inflation adjustment factors that are based on GDP implicit price deflators as reported in  Economic Indicators , U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1997.      14  NUREG/CR-6174, ""Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station: Effects of Current Regulatory and Other Considerations on the Financial Assurance Requirements of the Decommissioning Rule and on Estimates of Occupational Radiation Exposure,"" PNL-9975, Vol. 1, Main Report, Final Report, July 1996, pp. 3.2 and 4.5.      15  NUREG/CR-5884, ""Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station: Effects of Current Regulatory and Other Considerations on the Financial Assurance Requirements of the Decommissioning Rule and on Estimates of Occupational Radiation Exposure,"" PNL-8742, Vol. 1, Main Report, Final Report, November 1995, pp. 3.2 and 4.4.      16  The duration of reactor Configuration 2 is calculated as the difference between the length of the pool storage period and the length of reactor Configuration 1.      17  As noted in Section 3.2.3, the $48 million savings estimate assumes that sites obtaining exemptions would be required to maintain $75 million in on-site coverage and $100 million in off-site coverage. If the on-site and off-site exemption levels were set at $50 million and $75 million, respectively, the potential savings to licensees would fall to $30 million. If the on-site and off-site exemption levels were set at $25 million and $50 million, respectively, the potential savings would fall to $11 million.      18  The current maximum obligation for secondary financial protection for a licensee in the industry retrospective rating plan is $75.5 million with respect to any nuclear incident. In total, the financial protection for off-site liability for any incident equals the primary layer of $200 million plus the secondary layer of $75.5 million multiplied by the number of licensed power reactors with a rated capacity of 100,000 kWe or higher. This coverage currently amounts to approximately $8 billion.      19  Items 1 and 2 of the SRM were addressed previously in a memorandum dated August 4, 1993, from the EDO to the Commission.      20  SECY-96-256, ""Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11,"" December 17, 1996. The staff's recommended course of action was approved by the Commission by an SRM dated January 28, 1997.      21  A key distinction between NRC's existing    coverage levels and the coverage levels in the proposed rule is that, whereas    the existing coverage levels apply on a per-site basis, the proposed coverage    levels would apply on a per-reactor basis."

ACTION: Notice.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Department of Transportation is seeking public advice in  implementing the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program authorized in  Section 3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  (TEA-21). This notice also includes questions regarding the  implementation of the Job Access/Reverse Commute Program. Responses to  the questions posed are invited. DATES: Comments must be submitted by September 18, 1998.  ADDRESS: Comments should be sent to the Department of Transportation,  Docket # FTA-98-4343, Central Docket Office, PL-401, 400 Seventh  Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas Birnie, Program Manager, (202)  366-9157.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Program Preparation      The U.S. Department of Transportion (DOT) intends to complete a  program solicitation and guidelines by October 1, when FY 1999 funding  becomes available. Funding availability in early FY 1999 will ensure  that assistance provided pursuant to Section 3037 of TEA-21 may be  applied in a timely fashion to support regional programs creating Job  Access and Reverse Commute services. Limited funding, particularly in  the initial years of the program, may affect funding availability for  some applications.     Although implementing guidelines for the Job Access & Reverse  Commute program are being developed, prospective applicants should  review the legislative criteria as a guide to the preparation of  programs for funding. Please note that the Job Access & Reverse Commute  funding is predicated on the development of local partnerships. A  collaborative transportation/human services planning process must be  established to develop Job Access programs. This process should involve  agencies implementing welfare and work force development programs, non- profit community based and faith-based organizations, stakeholder  representatives, employers and a variety of existing transportation  providers and agencies. In larger urban areas, Metropolitan Planning  Organizations (MPO) will select applicants and in smaller urbanized and  rural areas, states will select applicants. The programs that are  developed are to be regional in nature, although portions of the  program can be targeted to specific areas within the region. An area  may have one designated recipient for funds, but these funds may be  passed to any number of subrecipients. An operating partnership  involving consultation and use of existing public, private and non- profit transportation providers, including the area transit agency, is  expected. Using the existing transportation infrastructure reduces  start-up costs and enhances service sustainability. Finally, a  financial partnership is encouraged among the stakeholders. The Job  Access and Reverse Commute program requires a 50/50 match. This program  is considered catalytic funding upon which to assemble additional human  service, transportation and private resources to meet job access  transportation needs.     Funding from other Federal programs may be used as match dollars.  These include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and  Community Services Block grants through the U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and Welfare to Work (WtW) grants through the  U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant  and HOPE VI Grants. TANF and WtW grants, when used as match, may be  used only for new and expanded transportation services and cannot be  used for construction or to subsidized current transportation operating  expenses. Such funds also must supplement rather than supplant other  State expenditures on transportation. Other transportation funds  allocated to transportation agencies by DOT may also be used to address  these transportation needs.  Public Consultation      DOT in conjunction with its other Federal partners desires to  develop a Job Access & Reverse Commute program that is responsive to  the needs of the stakeholders who are implementing welfare reform and  transportation activities. We are seeking your advice on the questions  listed below and other issues related to the implementation of the  program. Although we will not be able to respond directly to individual  comments, we will address collectively the comments received when we  issue the national program solicitation and guidelines. For the  convenience of those individuals and organizations with computer access  to the internet, you may submit your written comments to FTA home page  web site, which may be reached at--http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw/japc.     Additionally, any public interest organization seeking to elaborate  upon its views with Departmental officials may request a meeting.  Please contact Ms. Corine Hegland, U.S. Department of Transportation at  (202) 366-8850.  Program Purpose      The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program provides competitive  grants to local governments and non-profit organizations to develop  transportation services to connect welfare recipients and low-income  persons from their residence to employment and support services.  Program Features      Section 3037 of TEA-21 authorizes a Job Access and Reverse Commute  program. Job Access projects provides transportation services to  connect welfare recipients and low-income persons to jobs and  activities related to employment. Reverse Commute projects provides the  public transportation services to the general public that provide  connections to suburban employment centers from urban centers, rural  areas and other suburban locations.     <bullet> Criteria for selection include indication of the need for  additional services as identified in the transportation plan and  explanation of the extent to which services will address these needs.  Funding Features      <bullet> Split funded from both the Mass Transit Account and  General Funds.     <bullet> Guaranteed funding (Mass Transit Account & general  revenues) increases from $50 million in 1999 to $150 million in 2003.     <bullet> Not more than $10 million per year may be used for reverse  commute activities.     <bullet> Provides 50% Federal share.     <bullet> Other Federal transportation-eligible funds could be used  to meet the local match, including TANF and WtW funding for Access to  Jobs projects.

Job Access and Reverse Commute Program Implementation Questions  Funding Distribution & Program Focus      1. In FY 1999, funding for the Job Access/Reverse Commute Program  may be limited to $50 million. In light of funding constraints, what  grant award strategy should be pursued? Should there be maximum or  minimum grant sizes? Should grants vary by the size of the region,  e.g., major areas with populations over one million, areas between  200,000 and one million, areas between 50,000 and 200,000, non- urbanized rural areas?     2. Should grants to support local Job Access programs be made on an  annual basis or on a multi-year basis covering several years worth of  local activity? Annual multi-year financial grant commitments must be  made subject to the availability of congressional appropriations.     3. Should Job Access and Reverse Commute funding be considered as  one program where applicants can elect to reserve a percentage of their  funds for reverse commute services--not tied to welfare recipients or  low income person? Or, should the two components be treated as separate  programs operating independently?     4. What steps should FTA take to encourage a broad range of groups,  not limited to its normal mass transit partners, to participate in this  program?  Eligibility Criteria      1. The legislation requires that all grants be subject to the terms  and conditions of FTA's Formula (Section 5307) Program such as the  Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, labor protections and  others. In light of these requirements, what obstacles does this  present for non-traditional grant recipients? What actions, e.g.,  receiving funding as grantee subrecipients, are possible to ensure the  participation of non-traditional recipients in the program?     2. The legislation allows FTA to fund capital and operating costs  and clearly is directed to the development of new and expanded Job  Access and Reverse Commute services. In addition, one of the factors  for consideration in grant award criteria is the need for additional  services.     What activities and services should be included as eligible? Should  any activities or services be specifically excluded?     Welfare block grants (TANF & WtW) and other DOT funds can be used  to purchase transit passes for welfare recipients and low income  persons on existing transit routes and services. Should Job Access and  Reverse Commute also be available to fund transit passes?     3. What criteria should be used for screening candidates? The  legislation spells out eight (8) factors that must be considered in  awarding grants (see program description). Do these factors need  additional definition? How should they be weighted in the rating  process? Are there other criteria that should be addressed? Certain  populations suffer disproportionate unemployment rates. How should  these ``hard-to-serve'' populations be treated in the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Program?  Planning and Evaluation      1. The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program provides funding for  initiating programs whose long-term viability will depend upon  coordinating services and programming traditional sources of funding.  This will necessitate coordinating and integrating the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Program with existing DOT, DHHS, DOL and HUD funding  programs. What issues arise in achieving the blending of resources from  several Federal programs? What incentives and assurances could be  provided to facilitate this?     2. The legislation requires that MPOs select applicants within  urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 and that states select  applicants for urbanized areas with populations at or below 200,000, as  well as rural areas. How should this selection process by MPOs and  states take place and what documentation of participation should be  required to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in project  selection and development? In particular, how should low income  community representatives be involved in developing plans? Should sign- offs be required?     3. The legislation has a number of planning requirements for the  Job Access/Reverse Commute Program. For example, applicants must  document a regional transportation plan and any project must be  developed by a coordinated Transportation/Human Services planning  process.     Should applicants address each requirement separately or together?  What evidence of a collaborative decisionmaking process at the local  level among transportation, employment and other human service  organizations would satisfy these requirements?  [[Page 45928]]      4. The legislation has a number of coordination requirements.  Applicants must coordinate with the state agency that administers the  state welfare program. Applicants also must coordinate with affected  transit grant recipients and receive approval of such grant recipients.  What guidance should be given? How should this be documented?     5. The General Accounting Office must evaluate the effectiveness of  this program every six months, while DOT must prepare an evaluation  report within two years. What specific performance measures should DOT  use in assessing the effectiveness of this program? How could such data  be obtained and reported?  [Examples might include the number of additional jobs that became  accessible with reasonable commute times, the number of new riders or  new services, or some combination of the two, and area coverage by time  period]     6. What other comments or suggestions can you provide to ensure a  successful Job Access/Reverse Commute Program?      Issued: August 25, 1998. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.

Marine insurance, which is considered a delivery service, is covered in ADS 322.5.1. (See ADS 322.5.1)  314.3  Responsibility 1. Geographic bureaus are responsible for ensuring that assistance instruments reflect USAID's policies on the financing of delivery services. 2. The Bureau for Management, Office of Procurement, Transportation and Commodities Division, Transportation Branch (M/OP/TC/TRANS) is responsible for coordinating commodity transportation activities for USAID, including authorizing waivers, determining when ocean carriers are unavailable, and approving charters, and responsible for administering USAID policies and essential procedures with respect to delivery services.  314.4  Definitions (See ADS GLOSSARY) AIR WAYBILL BOOKING NOTE/BOOKING AGREEMENT CARGO PREFERENCE CHARTER/CHARTER PARTY  3   Last Revised 05/03/2000  DELIVERY SERVICES DESPATCH DEMURRAGE DETENTION INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION LINER SHIPMENT U.S. FLAG AIR CARRIER 314.5 POLICY The statements contained within the .5 section of this ADS chapter are the official Agency policies and corresponding essential procedures. 314.5.1 OCEAN SHIPMENT OF GOODS USAID shall follow the ocean transportation policies set forth in 22 CFR 228.21 regarding eligibility of ocean transportation service providers. The following sub-policies and essential procedures of 314.5.1 contain additional policies applicable only to ocean shipment of goods. (See Mandatory Reference, 22 CFR 228.21) E314.5.1 314.5.1a Ocean Shipment of Goods - N/A WAIVER REQUIREMENTS USAID shall follow the policies set forth in 22 CFR 228.55 and 228.56, when waiving ocean transportation eligibility requirements. Officials in the field who have authority to waive source requirements of commodities also have a limited amount of authority to waive the flag eligibility requirements of 22 CFR 228.21. (See ADS 103 for applicable redelegations) They may waive only for shipment of commodities for which they, or someone acting in that position, approved a commodity source waiver. (See Mandatory References, 22 CFR 228.55, 228.56, and 228.21) E314.5.1a Waiver Requirements USAID Missions must send a copy of each field-approved transportation waiver to the Bureau for Management, Office of Procurement, Transportation and Commodities Division, Transportation Branch (M/OP/TC/TRANS). 314.5.1b FREIGHT DIFFERENTIAL Section 640C of the FAA authorizes the use of grant funds to pay host countries for all or part of the differential between generally higher freight costs for U.S. flag vessels and lower cost, foreign flag vessels. USAID  4   Last Revised 05/03/2000  does not receive additional appropriations for this purpose; thus Assistant Administrators must decide when and to what extent USAID shall finance U.S. flag differential with funds available to the Bureau. E314.5.1b Freight Differential The following essential procedures must be followed in order to pay freight differential. 1) When the responsible Assistant Administrator decides to use funds to compensate recipients for all or part of the differential between freight costs for U.S. and foreign flag vessels, the geographic Bureau must ensure that adequate funds are available and reserved for that purpose. 2) The Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), determines a fair and reasonable differential between the proposed U.S. flag rate and the foreign flag rate. M/OP/TC/TRANS submits the request for differential determination to MARAD. 3) If U.S.-owned, excess local currency is available, M/OP/TC/TRANS determines if the carrier will accept the part of its payment corresponding to the differential in such currency. 314.5.1c DESPATCH, DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION It is USAID policy that the host country or the supplier must refund to USAID all despatch earned at the port of unloading on cost, insurance, and freight (C.I.F.) and cost and freight (C&F) shipments. When USAID finances the transportation costs for free on board (F.O.B.) or free alongside (F.A.S.) shipments, despatch earned at either the port of loading or unloading must be refunded to the extent that despatch exceeds demurrage incurred on the same voyage. Demurrage and detention costs are otherwise ineligible for USAID financing. E314.5.1c 314.5.1d Despatch, Demurrage and Detention - N/A DEAD FREIGHT USAID shall not finance the costs of dead freight. Dead freight is claimed by a vessel operator for booked or chartered space unoccupied or for cargo weight short-shipped according to the terms of the charter. E314.5.1d Dead Freight - N/A  5   Last Revised 05/03/2000  314.5.2  AIR TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION USAID shall follow the air transportation policies and essential procedures set forth in 22 CFR 228.22 regarding eligibility of ocean transportation service providers. (See Mandatory Reference 22 CFR 228.22)  E314.5.2  Air Travel and Transportation Suppliers, contractors, or grantees who claim payment for use of a nonU.S. flag air carrier must certify in writing with the claim for payment that United States flag air carriers were unavailable and state the reason.  314.5.2a  TRANS-SHIPMENT USAID shall finance costs incurred on air carriers under the flag registry of any free world country if: 1) Shipment is made on an air waybill issued by a U.S. flag air carrier covering shipment to the final destination; 2) The costs are part of the total cost paid to the U.S. flag air carrier; and 3) The first international portion of the flight is on the U.S. flag carrier.  E314.5.2a 314.5.3  Trans-shipment - N/A GENERAL TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS The policies and essential procedures relating to charters, inland transportation, and delivery service charges apply to both ocean and air transport.  E314.5.3 314.5.3a  General Transportation - N/A CHARTERS USAID shall not finance the cost of any ocean or air charter covering full or part cargo if M/OP/TC/TRANS has not approved the charter prior to shipment. This includes charter parties, booking notes, and booking agreements when those forms of freight contracts incorporate provisions which are in addition to, or which deviate from, the terms of the carrier's standard bill of lading and tariff. If approval for a charter was not requested prior to shipment, M/OP/TC/TRANS may determine that retroactive approval is justified in a particular case such as when it was  6   Last Revised 05/03/2000  not known at the time of shipment that the transaction would be financed by USAID. Commodities shall be made ineligible for USAID financing if shipped under any ocean or air charter which has not received prior approval of M/OP/TC/TRANS. (See ADS 312.5.5) E314.5.3a Charters M/OP/TC/TRANS determines whether the proposed charter is eligible for USAID financing, the rate is fair and reasonable, and the proposed charter conforms to cargo preference requirements, if applicable. M/OP/TC/TRANS provides approval of the charter, subject to subsequent receipt of a copy of the charter, signed by both parties. Charterers must submit the following information concerning proposed charters to M/OP/TC/TRANS in order to obtain approval: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) The name of vessel or air carrier; Flag; Commodity; Date of shipment; Ports of loading/discharge; Rate; and Demurrage/despatch provisions.  Suppliers who ship goods via charters must include a copy of the approved charter with the payment documentation submitted to USAID. 314.5.3b INLAND TRANSPORTATION USAID shall finance inland transportation beyond the point of entry in a cooperating country only when: 1) Intermodal transportation services covering the carriage of cargo from point of origin to destination is used with a through bill of lading; or 2) A waiver is authorized on the basis that the policy is clearly inconsistent with the purposes of the program. Among the considerations which may be cited in granting such a waiver are:  7   Last Revised 05/03/2000  a. An offset in the host country contribution to the project; b. Inability of the host country entity to budget for inland freight; and c. E314.5.3b 314.5.3c Enhanced security and timeliness of delivery.  Inland Transportation - N/A DELIVERY SERVICE CHARGES The price charged for delivery services, including ocean freight, must not exceed the prevailing price or the price paid by the supplier under similar circumstances to other customers. Ocean freight charges shall not exceed the established rate on file at the Federal Maritime Commission of the U.S, if any, for comparable shipments.  E314.5.3c 314.5.4  Delivery Service Charges - N/A VOLUNTARY AGENCIES - OCEAN TRANSPORTATION COSTS USAID has the authority to reimburse the American National Red Cross and registered U.S. private voluntary organizations for ocean transportation costs of goods, which have been donated to the organizations or purchased by them without USAID financing. a) Such shipments of donated or non-USAID financed goods which are not required to be on U.S. flag vessels by virtue of cargo preference requirements shall be eligible for financing on vessels under flag registry of any country in the free world. (See ADS 315) (Air shipments are covered by the policies in 314.5.2) b) USAID may reimburse transportation charges to points of entry, rather than ports of entry when: 1. The destination country is landlocked;  2. Ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disasters; 3. Carriers to a specific country are unavailable; or  8   Last Revised 05/03/2000  4. A substantial savings in cost or time can be achieved by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.

GX007-48-11139961	The  Federal Maritime Commission  (FMC)  was established in 1961 as an independent government agency, responsible for the regulation of shipping in the foreign trades of the United States. The Commission's five members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The FMC is headquartered at  800 North Capitol Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20573 , with five  Area Representatives  around the nation.    The Federal Maritime Commission        Protects shippers,     carriers and others  engaged in the foreign commerce of the U.S.from restrictive rules     and regulations of foreign governments and from the practices of foreign-flag carriers     that have an adverse effect on shipping in U.S. trades;          Investigates , upon its     own motion or upon filing of a  complaint , discriminatory,     unfair, or unreasonable rates, charges, classifications, and practices of ocean common     carriers, terminal operators, and freight forwarders operating in the foreign commerce of     the U.S.;          Receives  agreements      among ocean common carriers or marine terminal operators and monitors them to assure that     they are not substantially anticompetitive or otherwise violative of the Shipping Act of     1984;          Receives, reviews, and maintains electronic  tariff filings  which contain the rates,     charges and rules established by water carriers operating between the United States and     another country;          Regulates rates, charges, classifications, rules, and regulations     contained in  tariffs of carriers controlled by     foreign governments  and operating in U.S. trades to ensure that such matters are just     and reasonable;          Licenses U.S.-based international ocean  freight forwarders ;          Requires bonds of  non-vessel     operating common carriers  (NVOCCs); and          Issues  passenger vessel     certificates  showing evidence of financial responsibility of vessel owners or     charterers to pay judgments for personal injury or death or to repay fares for the     nonperformance of a voyage or cruise.      The FMC's jurisdiction encompasses many facets of the maritime industry. However, it has no jurisdiction over vessel operations, navigation, vessel construction, vessel documentation, vessel inspection, licensing of seafaring personnel, maintenance of navigational aids or dredging. These activities are handled by other federal, state and local agencies.     The principal shipping statutes administered by the FMC are the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 USC app. 1710 et seq), the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 (46 USC app. 1701 et seq), and section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 USC app. 876). The FMC's regulations are published in  46 CFR 500  et seq.

Background      The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program has two major goals: to  provide transportation services in urban, suburban and rural areas to  assist welfare recipients and other low-income individuals in accessing  employment opportunities, and to increase collaboration among the  regional transportation providers, human service agencies and related  service providers, employers, metropolitan planning organizations  (MPOs), states, and affected communities and individuals.     The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program is intended to  establish a regional approach to job access challenges through the  establishment of an area-wide Job Access and Reverse Commute  Transportation Plan. This plan is to be developed through a coordinated  transportation/human services planning process. Projects derived from  this plan support the implementation of a variety of transportation  services that may be needed to connect welfare recipients and other  low-income individuals to jobs and related employment activities. All  projects funded under the Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program  must be derived from such an area-wide plan.     While the projects must be planned in coordination with traditional  transit authorities, Metropolitan Planning Organizations and State  Departments of Transportation, other interested organizations could  take the lead in establishing the collaborative planning process or in  submitting a project application.     The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program will support  projects that are implemented by a wide range of transportation  providers, but projects should be integrated within or coordinated with  the existing transportation system and make efficient and effective use  of existing transportation providers.     FTA is placing special emphasis on consultation with the community  to be served, including welfare recipients and low-income individuals,  individuals with disabilities, migrant workers, Native Americans and  community-based, faith-based and other organizations addressing the  interests of such individuals.     A Job Access project is designed to transport welfare recipients  and low-income individuals in urban, suburban, or rural areas to and  from jobs and activities related to their employment. Job Access  projects implement new transportation services or extend existing  services to fill the gaps that exist in many areas between where  welfare recipients and low-income persons live and employment  opportunities. Job Access and Reverse Commute grants funded under this  program may not be used for planning or coordinating activities and  cannot supplant existing sources of funding. Only new or expanded  services are eligible for funding.     Funding for Job Access and Reverse Commute grants is authorized at  $150 million annually. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st  Century (TEA-21) provided guaranteed funding starting at $50 million in  fiscal year (FY) 1999, increasing by $25 million a year, and reaching  the full authorized $150 million in FY 2003. Funding above the  guaranteed level depends on congressional appropriations. No more than  $10 million annually can be used for grants designated as Reverse  Commute projects.     Program funding is divided in the following manner: sixty percent  (60%) for areas with populations 200,000 and above, twenty percent  (20%) for areas between 50,000-200,000 population, and twenty percent  (20%) for areas below 50,000 population.     Congress has appropriated $75 million for the Job Access and  Reverse Commute grants in FY 2000. Of this amount, Congress has  allocated $49.57 million for specific states and localities.  [[Page 13211]]  The remaining $25.4 million plus $4.2 million in unobligated FY 1999  funding is available for competitive award. The following chart  provides information on the amounts available for competitive projects  in each funding category, as well as the amounts reserved for specific  areas by each funding category.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                       Approximate amounts for projects in areas                                                                        with population--(funding in millions)                                                                    ---------------------------------------------                                                                                                       Totals for                                                                      >200,000     50-      >50,000    all areas --------------------------------------------------------------------------------200,000------------------------- FY 2000 Funds Available...........................................      $45.0      $15.0      $15.0        $75.0 Amounts Reserved for Specific Projects............................       30.2        9.0       10.4         49.6     FY 2000 Funds Available for Competitive Award.................       14.8        6.0        4.6         25.4 FY 1999 Funds Not Allocated.......................................        1.0        2.8         .4          4.2                                                                    ---------------------------------------------     Total Funds Available for Competitive Award...................       15.8        8.8        5.0         29.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A 50 percent non-DOT match is required. Other Federal funds that  are eligible to be used for transportation costs can be used as part of  the match. Applicants should submit projects that can be started within  six months, but no later than within one year.  II. Changes in the Fiscal Year 2000 Solicitation  A. Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan      In FY 1999, it was not clear to some what the difference was  between the Regional Job Access and Reverse Commute Plan and the  Regional Transportation Plan developed by Metropolitan Planning  Organizations in urbanized areas as required by the FHWA/FTA Joint  Planning regulations. The plans required for the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program are short-term, operational service plans that are  meant to address gaps in current transit service that impede welfare  recipients and low-income persons from reaching jobs and employment  support services. The Regional Transportation Plan is a long-range plan  that identifies area transportation needs in light of projected growth  patterns and broadly charts major capital investments for  transportation system development to meet these projected needs. To  avoid confusion, we have renamed job access plans as Area-Wide Job  Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plans.  B. Persons With Disabilities      Because of high employment experienced by persons with disabilities  and their more dispersed residential patterns, the Job Access and  Reverse Commute Plans are now required to identify projects which  address the mobility needs of this population in reaching employment  sites and support activities. Applicants also must submit with their  proposals a certification that the requirements of the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) will be met. (See Appendix E)  C. Multi-Year Commitments      In FY 1999, a number of applicants sought multi-year commitments  from FTA. Because of limited funding available, recipients of FY 1999  Job Access and Reverse Commute funding seeking second year funding must  compete with other applicants. They will be evaluated based on  demonstrated progress in meeting the goals of their project, as well as  on the general evaluation criteria. A full application must be  submitted, including the transmittal memo, the proposal narrative and  plan and any relevant updates, and documentation of demonstrated  progress towards meeting project goals.  D. One-Step Application Process      In fiscal year 1999, FTA required applications to be submitted in  two stages: The project proposal, including the Job Access and Reverse  Transportation Plan, to be submitted first, and for applications  approved for funding, the supplementary documentation necessary to meet  the requirements of FTA's Section 5307 program. Some applicants wished  to have a one-step instead of a two-step application process. This  year, applicants may submit the entire application simultaneously,  including project proposal and the supplementary documentation, if they  choose to. (See Sections II and III) Those wishing to submit a single  application should work closely with the appropriate FTA regional  office. (See Appendix A for Regional Contacts)  E. Projects for Congressionally-Designated Areas      Applicants for projects supporting the development of local  transportation services and related promotional activities in  congressionally-selected areas must submit applications responding to  the same program selection criteria as applications for competitive  selection. Such applications shall demonstrate conformity with the  requirements of the Job Access and Reverse Commute program and will  provide information to demonstrate sound project management.  III. General Program Information  A. Authority      Section 3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  (TEA-21).  B. Background      While two-thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, three-quarters  of welfare recipients live in rural areas or in central cities. In  metropolitan areas with extensive transit systems, studies have shown  that less than half of the jobs are accessible by transit. Even fewer  jobs are accessible by transit in areas with limited transit systems.  Many entry-level workers have difficulty reaching jobs during evening  or weekend shifts when transit services are frequently diminished or  non-existent. Work trips can also be complex, involving several  destinations including childcare providers. The problems can be more  challenging in rural areas where approximately 40 percent of rural  counties lack public transit systems and commuting distances generally  are longer than in urban areas.     Auto ownership among welfare recipients and low-income persons is  low. Most welfare recipients do not own cars and nearly 40 percent of  workers with annual incomes below $10,000 do not commute by car. In  1991, the median price of a new car was equivalent to 25 weeks of  salary for the average worker and considerably more for the low-income  worker.     Transportation is clearly a key barrier to those moving from  welfare to work. Providing a variety of new or expanded transportation  options for low-income workers, especially those who are receiving or  who have recently received welfare benefits, will increase the  [[Page 13212]]  likelihood that those workers will get and retain jobs.     In FY 1999, $75 million was appropriated and FTA awarded  approximately $71 million, $67.5 million for job access projects and  $3.4 million for reverse commute projects. Successful applicants in the  first round were announced on May 13, 1999 and included a variety of  services ranging from extended bus routes and specialized van services  reaching new employment sites to guaranteed ride home programs and late  night and weekend service providing additional hours of service.  Project descriptions can be found on the FTA website at  (www.fta.dot.gov/wtw). The remaining uncommitted funds are added to the  FY 2000 appropriation.  C. Scope      Improving mobility and advancing economic development are key  strategic goals of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Job Access  funds help improve mobility and economic opportunity for welfare  recipients and other low-income people through implementing new or  expanded transportation activities. Reverse Commute funds help improve  mobility to suburban employment opportunities for the general public,  as well as for welfare recipients and low-income people.  D. Eligible Applicants      Consistent with Section 3037 (b)(4)(A) & (B), local agencies and  authorities, non-profit organizations and designated recipients under  other FTA programs (usually a state entity or a regional transit  authority) are eligible applicants for Job Access and Reverse Commute  grant program funds. Local agencies and authorities include states,  local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), public  transit agencies and tribal governments.     In urbanized areas with 200,000 population or more, MPOs select the  applicant(s). FTA urges MPOs to designate a single recipient to submit  a consolidated application in urbanized areas with such populations.     In small urbanized areas under 200,000 population and in non- urbanized, rural areas, states select the applicant. For areas between  50,000-200,000 population, applications forwarded to the state for  selection must be endorsed by the area MPO as projects that the MPO  would be willing to program in the Transportation Improvement Program  if the projects were selected for funding States are urged to serve as  the designated recipient for grants to small urbanized and non- urbanized areas. The selected grant recipient can sub-allocate funds to  other project participants.     Tribal governments must go through the state selection process but,  once selected, can choose to be sub-recipients of the state or, as  sovereign governments, can apply directly to FTA. States are encouraged  to work closely and expeditiously with tribal applicants. FTA regional  offices are available to facilitate this process.  E. Eligible Projects  1. In General     Job Access or Reverse Commute projects derived from an Area-Wide  Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan are eligible. Please  note that grants awarded under the Job Access and Reverse Commute  program may not be used for planning or coordinating activities.  (Section 3037(e)) However, metropolitan and statewide planning funds  made available under the FTA Section 5303 and 5313(b) programs and  FHWA/FTA Joint Planning, Section 49 CFR part 613, Section 23 CFR part  420, and state planning and research funds (SPR) can be used to fund  welfare to work transportation planning activities at a 100 percent  Federal share. Other funds, including the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services' Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the  Department of Labor's Welfare-to-Work (WtW) administrative funds, can  also be used for transportation planning activities consistent with the  allowable uses of those resources. Lead applicants submitting  consolidated applications on behalf of a number of subrecipients may  apply for administrative costs up to ten percent of the grant request. 2. Job Access Project     A Job Access project is directed at implementing new or expanded  transportation services. These services are targeted at filling  transportation gaps and designed to transport welfare recipients and  low-income individuals to and from jobs and other employment-related  support services such as childcare and job readiness, training and  retention services. The Job Access Grant Program funds the capital and  operating costs of new or expanded transportation services.     Localities have wide flexibility in selecting service strategies  that are appropriate for their areas, including, but not limited to:     (a) Adding late night and weekend service;     (b) Providing a guaranteed ride home service;     (c) Initiating shuttle service;     (d) Extending fixed route mass transit service;     (e) Providing demand responsive van service;     (f) Sponsoring ridesharing and carpooling activities; and     (g) Encouraging bicycling.     To improve customer service and operating efficiency, localities  are encouraged to:     (a) Establish regional mobility managers or transportation  brokerage activities;     (b) Apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools;     (c) Implement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including  customer trip information technologies;     (d) Integrate automated regional public transit and human service  transportation, including health services, information, scheduling and  dispatch functions; and     (e) Deploy vehicle position monitoring systems.     Job Access and Reverse Commute grants also may be used for  promoting the use of:     (a) Transit by workers with non-traditional work schedules,     (b) The purchase of transit vouchers by appropriate agencies for  welfare recipients and eligible low-income individuals;     (c) The development of employer-provided transportation such as  shuttles, ridesharing, carpooling; or     (d) The use of transit pass programs and benefits under Section 132  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.     Marketing and advertising are examples of promotional activities  that could be undertaken to increase awareness of these transportation  options and their benefit to welfare recipients and low-income  individuals. Other locality-specific actions, strategies and linkages  that further the program goals also may be eligible.     While the marketing and promotion of transit pass programs are  eligible expenses under the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, the  funding of individual transit passes is not an eligible expense.  Additionally, the construction of child care centers and other  employment support facilities at transit hubs are not eligible for Job  Access grants. Transit-oriented construction activities are eligible  under FTA's Section 5307, 5309 and 5311 Formula Grant programs. Transit  passes are eligible expenses under Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families (TANF) and Welfare-to-Work (WtW) programs.     Programs for private automobile ownership and repair are not  legally eligible under this grant funding  [[Page 13213]]  program. However, programs supporting carpooling and other forms of  mass transportation and shared-ride use, such as jitneys or special  paratransit service, are eligible. In cases where vehicle acquisition  is part of the program, vehicles must remain under the continuing  control of the agency receiving the grant. 3. Reverse Commute Project     A Reverse Commute project facilitates the provision of new or  expanded public mass transportation services for the general public  from urban areas, suburban and rural areas to suburban work places.  Reverse Commute services include, but are not limited to:     (a) Bus, train, car and van pooling services, van routes, and     (b) The purchase or lease by a nonprofit organization or public  agency of a van or bus dedicated to shuttling employees from their  residences and transit transfer points to a suburban work place and  back again.  F. Cost Sharing      The Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program is intended to  fill gaps in existing services and leverage other Federal, state and  local transportation-related funding to address the unmet needs of  individuals moving from welfare to work and other low-income  populations. Neither funds awarded under this grant program, nor funds  used to match the grants, can be used to replace any existing source of  funds.     The maximum DOT share of a grant under the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program may not exceed 50 percent of the total project cost.  The non-DOT share shall be provided in cash. If funds are matched from  other Federal programs, the funds must be applied directly to project  expenses. Revenues from service agreements are an eligible match, but  revenues from individual fares cannot be used as a match.     Transportation-eligible funding from Federal programs other than  the Department of Transportation may be used to match DOT funds. These  funds include but are not limited to:     a. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);     b. Community Services Block Grants (CSBG) and Social Services Block  Grants (SSBG) administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services;     c. Welfare-to-Work (WtW) formula and competitive grants  administered by the U.S. Department of Labor; and     d. Community Development Block grants (CDBG) and HOPE VI grants  administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.     The prohibitions on the use of WtW funds for matching requirements  under section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act do not apply  to Federal or state funds that provide transportation services. TANF  and WtW grants, when used as a match, may be expended only for new or  expanded transportation services and cannot be used for construction or  to subsidize current transit operating expenses. Such funds also must  supplement rather than supplant other state expenditures on  transportation.     Under the TANF Final Rule, investment in transportation services  for families who are employed, including the purchase of transit  vouchers, and investments used as match for the Job Access and Reverse  Commute program, do not constitute ``assistance'' and, therefore, do  not trigger the 60-month lifetime limit on receipt of Federal benefits  nor the reporting requirements of families receiving ``assistance.''  The Secretaries of Transportation, Labor, and Health and Human Services  released revised joint guidance on the use of WtW and TANF funds on  December 23, 1998, which is currently being updated to reflect the  changes in the final TANF rule. Guidance on TANF funds, including  specific examples of eligible transportation investments, is available  on the web at [http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/ofa/funds2.htm].  (``Child Support Performance and Incentives Act of 1998,'' Pub.L. 105- 200, Sec. 403, ``Limitations on Use of TANF Funds for Matching Under  Certain Federal Transportation Programs.'').     More extensive guidance on the use of TANF and WtW funds for  transportation can be found on the FTA web site---- http:// www.fta.dot.gov/wtw.  G. Planning  1. Coordinated Transportation/Human Services Planning Process     Proposed Job Access and Reverse Commute projects must be derived  from an Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan  (see below) which results from a coordinated public transit and human  services transportation planning process. Any interested stakeholder  group in the area may initiate the planning process. FTA encourages  MPOs to serve as the regional forum in urbanized areas.     The planning process must include transportation planning officials  from state and metropolitan transportation planning organizations;  representatives from local transit agencies and other existing human  service, private, non-profit transportation operators; the agencies  administering TANF and WtW formula and competitive grants, and the  community to be served. Stakeholders within the community to be served  include welfare recipients and low-income residents as well as,  community and faith-based organizations, disability groups, farm and  migrant worker organizations and other groups representing the  interests of low-income persons.     The planning process also should include other stakeholders  organized transit labor representatives; employment, human service, and  child care support service providers; a variety of local and state  workforce development organizations including One-Stop Career Center;  public and assisted housing providers and community development  agencies; economic development agencies; employers and employer groups  (such as transportation management organizations and Chambers of  Commerce); elected representatives including tribal officials, and  state officials including mayors, county supervisors, state  legislators, governors and other state and local officials or their  designates, and other interested public citizens. 2. Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan     The purpose of collaboration is to develop a comprehensive area- wide approach to providing transportation services to welfare  recipients and low-income persons regardless of jurisdictional  boundaries. In general, the Job Access and Reverse Commute program  should be viewed as a catalyst to provide long-term mobility and access  to jobs for welfare recipients and low-income individuals. Any project  proposed for funding should be identified in the Area-Wide Job Access  Transportation Plan resulting from the above process. The Plan is not  meant to supersede, but to build upon existing area welfare-to-work  transportation planning activities. The Area Wide Job Access and  Reverse Commute Transportation Plan must:     a. Identify the geographic distributions of welfare recipients and  low-income people in the region;     b. Identify the geographic distributions of employment centers and  employment-related activities in the region;     c. Identify existing public, private, non-profit and human service  transportation services in the region;     d. Identify transportation gaps between the geographic  distributions of  [[Page 13214]]  people, as specified in section ``a,'' and employment, as specified in  section ``b,'' which are not currently served by the transportation  services, as specified in section ``c,''     e. Identify projects to address the gaps identified in section  ``d.'' Each project identification must include:     (1) the goals and objectives of the project     (2) the cost of the project;     (3) An explanation of how the project will maximize use of existing  transportation service providers and what mechanisms will be used to  integrate or coordinate the project services with the existing  transportation network; and     (4) Identification of any employer-provided or employer-assisted  transportation service strategies incorporated in the project.     Prioritize the project(s) identified in section ``e'' for funding  and implementation. This is a requirement.     The Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute Transportation Plan  should build on and incorporate existing welfare to work transportation  planning activities.     In addition, since low-income persons with disabilities tend to be  more disbursed throughout the community than other low-income groups  that are geographically more concentrated, the Plan should include  specific identification of projects that will address the employment- related needs of this population. 3. The Role of Metropolitan Planning Organizations     MPOs are comprised of elected officials representing local  governments and transportation service providers within the  metropolitan area. They are responsible for adopting transportation  plans and improvement programs to address a region's unique  transportation needs and working with states to include these  priorities in statewide plans.     In regions with populations of more than 200,000, MPOs are  responsible for selecting applicants to be considered for Federal Job  Access and Reverse Commute grants. In regions with populations between  50,000 and 200,000, MPOs will recommend projects to the state, which  will select the applicants to be considered for Federal Job Access and  Reverse Commute grants.     This means that MPOs are responsible for the following:     (a) Determining that Job Access and Reverse Commute projects are  consistent with the regional long-range transportation plan.     (b) Ensuring that the submitted application contains prioritized  projects based on local need. Local priorities can be ascertained  through the collaborative human services/transportation planning  process and through consultation with the affected stakeholders.     (c) Endorsing and subsequently programming Job Access and Reverse  Commute projects into the area Transportation Improvement Program in  urbanized areas of over 50,000 population.     (d) Conducting the locally-developed public participation process  as required by Joint FHWA/FTA Planning Rule (23 CFR part 450, 49 CFR  part 613).     In all regions with MPOs, individual Job Access and Reverse Commute  projects must be adopted into the MPO's Transportation Improvement  Program (TIP) prior to receiving a grant. Because this entails a formal  review and project approval by the MPO Policy Board, FTA strongly urges  the partners developing the Area-Wide Job Access and Reverse Commute  Transportation Plan to communicate with the MPO at an early stage.  Further, as financial sustainability of a project is one of the  evaluation criteria, coordination with the agencies participating in  the MPO forum could be a critical factor in ensuring long-term support  for Job Access and Reverse Commute activities. 4. Statewide Transportation Planning Requirements     In all regions with populations of less than 200,000, the state is  responsible for selecting applicants, based on the recommendation of  the MPO in areas between 50,000-200,000 population. In addition, Job  Access and Reverse Commute projects selected for funding must be  endorsed by the state and incorporated into the statewide  transportation improvement program (STIP). Because this requires state  approval, FTA strongly urges the partners to communicate with state  officials, including the state DOT, at an early stage. In selecting  projects in rural areas, states should give priority to projects  providing service to places that are not currently served or are  underserved by public transit systems. States must prioritize the  projects for funding based on their analysis of local needs and service  effectiveness, as well as the collaboration achieved among  stakeholders. Given the sovereign nature of tribal governments, tribal  projects need not be included in the state's prioritization of  projects, though they must be included in the State Transportation  Improvement Program (STIP). 5. Improved Transportation Planning     The statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes  mandated by TEA-21 promote ongoing, cooperative, and active involvement  of public transportation providers; the public; and state, metropolitan  and local government agencies in the development of state-wide and  metropolitan transportation plans and improvement programs. DOT expects  that the Job Access and Reverse Commute grant program will be a  catalyst for broadening the transportation planning process to better  integrate employment and social equity considerations.  J. General Grant Requirements      In addition to the project proposal based on the program-specific  requirements outlined in this notice, the applicant will be required to  submit appropriate certifications, assurances, and other documentation  necessary to meet the requirements of FTA's Urbanized Area Formula  Grant Program (Section 5307 program under Title 49, United States  Code). These include planning, environmental, school bus, charter,  procurement, labor protections and civil rights requirements, including  the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VI, Environmental Justice  and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, and drug and alcohol testing  requirements.     Applicants are encouraged to coordinate with affected transit labor  unions and to gather all information required by the U.S. Department of  Labor for labor certification as soon as possible to avoid delay in the  certification process upon grant selection. (See Appendix F for a  description of required information). Applicants must have the  financial, legal, and technical capacity to apply for and administer  projects. Copies of the Section 5307 program guidance (circular FTA  9030.1B ``Urbanized Area Formula Program: Grant Application  Instructions,'' Oct. 10, 1996) can be obtained from any FTA Regional  Office or electronically through the FTA website. (See Appendix D for  summary list.)  K. Performance Monitoring      FTA requires grant recipients to monitor the performance of their  Job Access and Reverse Commute services and to cooperate with the FTA  and General Accounting Office (GAO) national evaluations mandated by  law. Performance measures on: (1) Increasing access between welfare  recipients and low-income populations and employment sites; and (2) job  access/  [[Page 13215]]  reverse commute service effectiveness and efficiency will be sought.  The required performance measures for FY 1999 grants may be found on  FTA's web site (www.fta.dot.gov/wtw). Similar measures will be required  for FY 2000 grantees. Performance monitoring primarily will take place  through FTA standard project quarterly progress reports. Quarterly  reports and other information must be reported in accordance with FTA's  standard reporting requirements which are: (1) For projects in non- urbanized areas, reporting requirements for the 5311 Program (FTA C  9040.1E, page VI-6) annual status reports, annual financial status  reports, and annual Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) reports;  (2) for projects in urbanized areas, reporting requirements for the  5307 Program, Transit Database Reporting, annual audits and triennial  review.  IV. Guidelines for Preparing Grant Application      FTA is conducting a national solicitation for applications under  the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program. Grant awards will be made  on a competitive basis. FTA encourages both traditional transportation  recipients and a variety of new program entrants non-traditional  grantees in urban, suburban, and rural areas to participate in the  development of projects. To assist new program applicants in  particular, a two-step application process is available. Applicants  must submit a proposal that describes the proposed project for which  funding is sought and responds to the requirements outlined in this  Notice. If selected, the applicant must then document compliance with  the standard FTA requirements listed in Appendix D as well as complete  the securement of the financial match for the grant. Applicants may  elect to submit a single application containing both the proposal and  documentation of FTA standard requirements. Contact the appropriate FTA  regional office for guidance on meeting standard FTA program  requirements.  A. Grant Funding Amounts      Suggested grant sizes are identified below. (Applicants may request  smaller amounts from FTA.)     1. For urbanized areas with populations of over one million, FTA  expects to make grants of no more than $1 million. (Places with  populations of above 5 million may request funding above $1 million.)     2. For urbanized areas with populations greater than 200,000 and  less than one million, FTA expects to make grants of no more than  $500,000.     3. For urbanized areas with populations between 50,000 and 200,000,  FTA expects to make grants of no more than $200,000. States should not  submit applications that collectively exceed $1 million for this  category.     4. For rural areas (areas with populations of less than 50,000),  individual area grant applications generally should not exceed  $150,000. Collective grant applications by states for rural areas  should not exceed $1 million. Tribal applications may be considered  separately from the state funding limitation.  B. Project Scope      Proposed projects must be drawn from an Area-Wide Job Access and  Reverse Commute Transportation Plan and focus on new or expanded  transportation services. Applicants should focus on projects that can  be started  within six months, but no later than within one year of  grant award.  V. Application Development and Submission      To promote collaboration and reduce administrative paperwork, FTA  strongly encourages the submission of a consolidated application by a  single entity in urbanized areas and the submission of a consolidated  application by the state for rural areas. In both cases, funds may be  passed on to sub-recipients. Tribal governments submitting projects  that are selected by the state may choose to allow the state to include  their project(s) in the state's application or, as sovereign  governments, may apply directly to FTA. Since existing FTA grantees may  have already met or have on file information that will satisfy many of  the FTA requirements that apply to this program, FTA encourages states  and local transit agencies to serve as the single entity by submitting  applications on behalf of other entities.     Applicants must submit an original and two paper copies of the  application proposal to the appropriate FTA regional office.  Additionally, the application proposal is to be submitted via e-mail to  the FTA at: (JobAccess@fta.dot.gov). If an applicant is unable to  submit the application electronically via e-mail, the proposal should  be submitted on a 3.5 formatted disk for use on a personal computer  (PC). Documents should be submitted in Word or Rich Text Format (RTF).  Tables should be submitted in an Excel, or Tab Delimited Format.  Submissions must be postmarked by, as well as electronically sent,  where feasible, to FTA by May 9, 2000.     Applicants with access to TEAM, FTA's electronic grant making and  management system, should enter standard grant information into TEAM  once projects have been selected. For those applicants with access to  TEAM that choose the one-step application process and submit a single  comprehensive application (application proposal and standard section  5307 requirements), all standard grant requirement information also  should be entered into TEAM.     The application proposal should provide detailed information on  each project for which FY 2000 funds are being requested. The  application should include the following elements:  A. Transmittal Memo      Include the following information:     1. The Name of Applicant(s) and the Type of Agency (See Appendix G  for list of agency types).     2. A List of Sub Recipients and the Types of Agencies (See Appendix  G).     3. Name, Address and Telephone Number of a Person to be Contacted  for Additional Information.     4. Name, Title, and Complete Address of Person to be Notified if  Grant is Awarded.     5. Area(s) to be Served: Cities, Counties, Tribal Lands and States.     6. Project Summary. Two paragraphs to be used for press purposes  should the application be selected for funding. The summary should  contain: a brief description and list of the planning partners; a brief  overview of the transportation challenges in the area; a brief  description of the services to be funded; the intended project  beneficiaries and the identification of any employment support services  (e.g., training, child care, or housing) that will be coordinated with  the proposed transportation services.     7. A Brief Description of the Applicant's Organizational Capability  to Carry Out the Project.     8. Identification of the Area as a Designated Empowerment Zone,  Enterprise Community, or Champion Community, if applicable.     9.

C. Project Budget      Provide a project budget for each project. (see Appendix C).  VI. Grant Review Process      Applications for competitive funding are to be submitted to the  appropriate FTA Regional Office by the close of business TBD. FTA will  screen all applications to determine whether all required eligibility  elements, as  [[Page 13217]]  described in the following checklist, are present. FTA will select  projects based on what is most advantageous to the government,  considering, in addition to the award criteria, the time frame in which  projects can be implemented, Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community  status, use of innovative approaches, such as transportation mobility  management/brokerage institutional arrangements and the application of  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS ) technologies, and geographic distribution of project  funding.  A. Project Eligibility Checklist--include the following:      This checklist is provided for the applicant to use to ensure that  the required documentation has been provided in the application.  Failure to provide the documentation listed below will make an  applicant's proposal non-responsive and it will not be evaluated  further.

Some of these items  are covered in the application, in which case you will not need to  submit information twice.  Approval Prerequisites  (On file with FTA, or to be submitted with application and updates  as appropriate) Opinion of Counsel Authorizing Resolution Current annual Certification and Assurances Civil rights submissions up-to-date     Title VI     Annual DBE Goal     DBE Program     EEO Program     ADA National Transit Database reports up-to-date Any outstanding oversight findings resolved or resolution plan and  schedule set  Additional Information  Project Budget Project Description Project Justification/Supporting Information as necessary Project Milestone Schedule Labor Union Description(s) (See Appendix F for a description of  required information) Environmental Review     Date of FTA's signing of FONSI (Finding of No Significant  Impact), or     Date of FTA's signing of ROD (Record of Decision) closing out  the EIS process, or     Grant applicant's Categorical Exclusion recommendation if  neither (a) nor (b) above applies Air Quality     Date of project level conformity determination by FTA, or     Applicant's recommendation concerning list of exemptions in the  conformity regulation (40 CFR Part 51) STIP--Date of Approval by FTA Request for copy of Master Agreement (If applicant does not have  latest one on file)  Appendix E: ADA Certification  Assurance of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability      As required by U.S. DOT regulations, ``Nondiscrimination on the  Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting  from Federal Financial Assistance,'' at 49 CFR part 27, implementing  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with  Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, the Applicant assures that, as  a condition to the approval or extension of any Federal assistance  awarded by FTA to construct any facility, obtain any rolling stock  or other equipment, undertake studies, conduct research, or to  participate in or obtain any benefit from any program administered  by FTA, no otherwise qualified person with a disability shall be,  solely by reason of that disability, excluded from participation in,  denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in  any program or activity receiving or benefiting from Federal  assistance administered by the FTA or any entity within U.S. DOT.  The Applicant assures that project implementation and operations so  assisted will comply with all applicable requirements of U.S. DOT 29  U.S.C. 794, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as  amended, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. At 49 CFR parts 27, 37, and 38, and  any applicable regulations and directives issued by other Federal  departments or agencies.  Appendix F: Information Required by the U.S. Department of Labor for  Labor Certification  I. Background      Federal Transit law requires that fair and equitable  arrangements must be made, as determined by the U.S. Department of  Labor (DOL), to protect the interests of employees affected by Job  Access and Reverse Commute grants. These interests include the  preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits under existing  collective bargaining agreements, the continuation of collective  bargaining rights, the protection of individual employees against a  worsening of their positions related to employment, assurances of  employment to employees of acquired mass transportation systems,  priority of reemployment, and paid training or retraining.     DOL processes the employee protection certifications required  under section 5333(b) in accordance with procedural Guidelines  published at 29 CFR 215.3 (July 28, 1999 Federal Register). The DOL  will process Job Access grants serving populations of 200,000 or  more by referring a copy of the grant application to labor  organizations representing affected employees and seeking the views  of organized labor and the grant recipients on proposed  certification terms. For grants serving populations under 200,000,  DOL will issue its certification without seeking the views of the  parties. In either case, the certification terms will be based on  existing protective arrangements used for prior FTA grants, if any,  or standard operating and/or capital arrangements developed by the  DOL where there are no existing arrangements. (Such existing  arrangements do not include the Special Section 13(c) Warranty that  is used for projects funded under the Section 5311 program.)     It is essential where there are questions regarding the DOL  certification process and/or information needed by DOL to obtain a  labor certification that the applicant contact the appropriate  Regional Office immediately. Where information lacks specificity, is  unclear or is missing, DOL will place the grant application in an  ``incomplete'' status until the necessary information is received.  Conceptual terms such as ``collaborative effort'' or ``working in  conjunction with * * *'' or ``services will be provided to assist *  * *'' do not provide the specificity necessary for DOL to process a  grant.     Upon receipt of a grant application, DOL will determine whether  there is sufficient information to process the grant application.  Because it is DOL's responsibility to address the protections  afforded employees through the certification of appropriate  protections, it must examine the activities of each subrecipient  under the grant in order to frame a protective arrangement  appropriate to the activity funded. The following information is  needed by DOL to process all Job Access and Reverse Commute grant  [[Page 13220]]  applications (including those areas under 200,000).  II. Description of Required Information      DOL needs the following information to process a grant  application for labor certification.     a. Project Description (Brief). This section should contain a  brief, succinct description of what is in the project. This  generally would cover the major budget line items.     b. Project Description (Detail). This section should provide a  complete description of each activity to be undertaken. It should  include funding information, what the project application is for,  how and where line items will be used whether the project is new  service, and a description of the operating service area of the  recipient or subrecipient. If there is more than one subrecipient  under a grant, this information must be developed for each  subrecipient's portion of the project.     c. Grantee Contact Person. This information is not contained in  the TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please enter the  name of a contact person for the grantee. In addition, if the grant  will ``pass through'' funding to one or more subrecipients or other  public entities, enter the full name of the subrecipient or other  public entity, a contact name, mailing address, telephone number and  facsimile number for each of these.     d. Union Information. This information is not contained in the  TEAM application. Under ``Project Details'' please (1) identify all  the labor organizations that represent transit employees of the  recipient and each subrecipient, and (2) identify any other  transportation providers which operate in the service area of the  recipient and the subrecipients and all labor organizations that  represent employees of these other transportation providers. Because  employee protections are not limited to the employees of the grant  recipient, other service area providers must be identified. Please  note that a useful reference for obtaining labor union information  is contained in Directory of U.S. Labor Organizations, 1999 edition.  This may be purchased from the Bureau of National Affairs Books,  P.O. Box 7814, Edison, N.J. 08810-7814. Telephone orders: 1-(800)- 960-1220.     For each local of a nationally affiliated union, the applicant  must provide the name of the national organization and the number or  other designation of the local union. (For example, Amalgamated  Transit Union Local 1258.) Since DOL makes its referral to the  national union's headquarters, there is no need to provide a local  contact in these situations.     However, for each independent labor organization (i.e., a union  that is not affiliated with a national or international  organization) the local contact information will be necessary (name  of organization, contact person, mailing address, telephone number,  facsimile number).     e. Extended Budget Descriptions. This must provide a project  description and project justification for most line items. There are  few line items that need no additional description and/or  justification. If there are subreceipients under a grant, indicate  which subrecipient will receive funds under each budget description.     If you have any questions, please contact the U.S. Department of  Labor, Division of Statutory Programs, at (202) 693-0126   Appendix G: Agency Classifications   State Government     State DOT     State Human Services     State Labor/Employment     Other State Agencies Indian Tribe Transportation Providers     Public Transportation Providers     Regional Public Transit Authority     State Transit Agency     City Transit Agency     County Transit Agency     Private for Profit Companies     Bus     Taxi     Specialized Service (e.g., Medicaid Operator)     Other     Non-Profit Organizations     Human Services Transportation Provider     Community-Based Organization     Other Transportation Planning Organizations     MPO     Council of Governments     Other Local governments--General Purpose     County Government     City Government Human Sevice Agencies     Local County/City Public Human Svcs Agency     Local County/City Welfare Agency     Local County/City Workforce Development Agency     Local Public Housing Agency     Non-Profit Service Providers     Human Support Services (e.g., Child Care, Substance Abuse)      Employment (e.g., Job Training,   Job Placement) Economic Development Agencies     Local/County Government     Non-Profit Corporations Private Nonprofit Agencies     Community Action Agencies & Organizations     Community-Based Organizations     Faith-Based Organizations     Other private nonprofit organizations Business Organizations     Chamber of Commerce     Transportation Management Organization Other Organizations  [FR Doc. 00-5810 Filed 3-9-00; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910-57-U

Wes Baysinger, Director Materials Management CS/mm Attach  Copy to:  Clerk of the Board John Werbach, Library District Harry Courtright, Library District Vickie Terbovich, Library District Carmen Ledesma, Materials Management   SERIAL 02073-RFP  SMART CARD FOR LIBRARY DISTRICT 1.0 INTENT: The Maricopa County Library District is seeking proposals which serve the library marketplace for a single product that performs the following functions while utilizing a stored value smart card: 1) Print Management -- including print cost recovery, 2) Public Computer Time Management, 3) Public Computer Reservation System, 4) Public Computer Session Personalization. MARICOPA COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT The Maricopa County Library District (MCLD) provides library services to residents of Maricopa County, Arizona and operates twelve (12) facilities in the county compose of: two (2) regional libraries and ten (10) community libraries. The Library District also provides outreach/bookmobile services. A third regional library is estimated for opening sometime in late October of 2002. Maricopa County Library District has more than 235,000 registered borrowers and a service population that reaches more than 600,000 people, in an area that covers more than 9,226 square miles. MCLD provides the public with access to more than 300 computers district wide that are capable of accessing the Internet as well as access to many other software applications loaded locally. Public PC access allows end users to print to various shared printers and allows MCLD to recover the costs associated with the printing process. MCLD estimates that a single medium sized branch library with 40 public Internet access PCs is generating an average of approximately 850 print transactions monthly or $406.00 per month. Based on County estimates, four (4) similar sized branches can generate nearly 40,000 print transactions or approximately $20,000. The focus of MCLD is the unincorporated areas of the county as well as other municipalities who contract with the County to provide library services. MCLD does not operate a ""main library"" but does operate regional service centers that are typically housed in larger facilities containing a greater number of public access computers for Internet access. Several of MCLD's community libraries are located in Hispanic communities where the majority of residents speak Spanish only and represent a wide-range of educational and economic levels. The various MCLD library locations are: North Central Regional (NE Phoenix), Southeast Regional (Gilbert), Aguila, El Mirage, Fountain Hills, Gila Bend, Guadalupe, Laveen, Litchfield Park, Queen Creek, Sun Lakes, Surprise. Access to MCLD's web site can be obtained through the following url: http://mcld.maricopa.gov The Library District currently uses DRA (Data Research Associates) Classic Automation system and corresponding modules, plus Internet Explorer version 5.5 (SP2) on all computer work stations with Internet access.  2.0  SCOPE OF WORK: 2.1 TAX: No tax shall be levied against labor. Bid pricing to include all labor, overhead, tools and equipment used, profit, and any taxes that may be levied. It is the responsibility of the bidder to determine any and all taxes and include the same in bid price. 2.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The software and hardware solution desired must utilize a smart card technology which includes an encrypted token that completely interfaces with the current and future library automated system 2   SERIAL 02073-RFP software currently used by MCLD and future systems which may be chosen by the MCLD. This means that the product must interface with SIP I & SIP II protocols in addition to NISO/XML interface protocol when it will be adopted by MCLD. SIP and NISO/XML protocols are mechanisms that connect the customer transaction database from the library's automated system to the software that manages the three-fold system outlined in this request for proposal. Such software must treat each branch of the Maricopa County Library District as a separate, yet integrated facility, while at the same time allowing flexibility related to the number of individual public computer workstations housed in that branch facility. The proposed solution should support both on-line transactions (e.g. printing, fines) and off-line transactions (e.g. photocopies, microfiche printers) using the stored value on the library smart card. The stored value of the library smart card should have hardware security mechanisms in place to avoid `buffering', and the on-chip purse should contain the data required to provide server account reconciliation. The library district may elect to purchase other equipment such as offline controllers, specialized keyboards with dedicated smart card readers, which must be compatible with the stored value purse of a library smart card. All transaction related software modules should run on computers utilizing Windows98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems. 2.2.1 Operating System Platforms Supported and Integration with Existing Computer Environment: The software application provided for the end-user/customer/public access computers must successfully operate on Windows NT, Windows NT (Gates Foundation Configuration), and Windows 2000 Professional operating systems. The software application provided for the end-user/customer/public access computers should also successfully operate in legacy Windows 98 operating system, and the potential provider should anticipate customer deployment of other advanced operating systems such as Windows XP Professional operating system and plan functionality in this system environment as well. The software application provided for end-user/customer/public access computers must successfully operate with the existing security applications  Fortress, Full Control, Library Centurion Guard, Deep-Freeze and other like security applications used in typical library public access computing environments. The software application provided for end-user/customer/public access computers must integrate with Maricopa County Library District's existing and future library automation systems using the SIP-I or SIP-II interface. The software solution should provide the SIPII functionality to interact with the SIP-I or SIP-II functionality on the library's automation system. Further, the software application must be scalable to interface and operate with the NISO/XML interface protocol or similar protocol associated with library automated system software in the marketplace. The operating system environment for server side management of the anticipated system shall be Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server or Windows XP Server running SQL Server 7.0 or SQL Server 2000 to manage the customer database interface environment. The networking and communications protocols for Maricopa County Library District are primarily Microsoft TCP/IP and VMS or Unix versions of TCP/IP Protocols. The system shall run on a server containing an Intel based Pentium III or IV processor containing not less than 512 MB of RAM, containing 18-36 Gigabytes of disk space while running Windows 2000 Server or Windows NT Server or similar operating system. DBMS Standard  Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 7.0 Since an RDBMS is required, it should be a standardized product such as already being used at the Library District 3   SERIAL 02073-RFP The solution proposed must successfully be installed in at least three (3) customer sites that contain 10 or more branches or have a similar population served and have been operational for at least one (1) year. Product must demonstrate installations within public library sites of similar size and scope as customer reference sites are desirable. 2.2.2 Smart Card Specifications: The preferred system must employ an Integrated Circuit Contact Smart Card and twofactored secure patron log-on and log-off in addition, the Smart Card must have the ability to include other technologies including Bar-Code, Magnetic Stripe, RF Proximity Antenna. The proposed system must have the ability to migrate from password / PIN log on protection to Biometric log-on and the Smart Card solution must have the ability to contain a stored cash value that can be used in both on-line and off-line payment schemes. 2.2.2.1 Other Smart Card Requirements        Must have the method to register the Smart Card to a database that will enable rules to be applied to the patron session. The library must have the ability to select from various Smart Card readers that can fit a wide range of needs. The Smart Card must remain in the PCs reader for the entire session. The system must recognize in real time when a smart card is inserted or removed. When the Smart Card is removed, the preferred system must prompt the user for instructions on whether the patron is pausing the session or is logging off. If the customer does not respond to the ""pause / log-off"" prompt, the PC must automatically recycle to the library's preferred session starting point without displaying the patron's open screens. MCLD must have the ability to dynamically set the amount of time the system must wait until it recycles between the removal of the smart card and failure to respond to the ""pause: log-off"" prompt.  2.2.3  Print Management: The proposed solution shall support printers connected directly to the client machine, connected via networked to the client machine and connected to a spooling station for later release by the customer. All print management related software modules must support Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP operating systems, even when PostScript print drivers are used. Print management software must allow customers to name a print job and provide an optional coversheet for each print job to support customer privacy. System must allow for the purchase of print ""guest"" cards that may charge diffe rent prices per copy than those prices assessed from library smart card holders.  2.2.4  Print Pricing: The proposed solution shall should allow for printing to multiple printers, and allow for different rates to be assigned to different printers. The proposed solution must support different printing rates for different types of documents. As an example, a higher rate may be charged for color laser documents than is assessed for black and white laser printed 4   SERIAL 02073-RFP documents. Another example might be specific costs for larger prints such as poster sizes. The proposed solution must support both a price per page and a price per complete document. . e.g. price per ""packet"" of documents. The proposed solution must provide staff with a reporting mechanism in both paper and electronic version formats in order to obtain information about revenue collected per print job, per hour, per day, week, month or year. The proposed solution shall allow staff intervention for release of individual customer print jobs when necessary for customers that may be experiencing problems with their cards. 2.2.5 Spooling Station for Customer Print Release: (Optional Feature) The proposed solution should support an optional spooling station where library customers can release and pay for print jobs when they are ready to pick up the printouts. The release station must confirm the cost of each job, and it must allow library users to confirm the release or deletion of each print job. The spooling station must hold un-printed print jobs for a period defined by the library before deleting the files. When an end-user/patron inserts their smart card into the car reader at the spooling station, the print jobs for that user and only that user must display. If the user is an administrator/librarian, the administrator must be presented with the option to display all un-printed jobs on the spooling station. 2.2.6 PC and Resource Management: The proposed software shall provide Maricopa County Library District customers the ability to schedule individual public access computer resources. Such software must also provide library staff with the ability to schedule groups of public access computer resources. Thus allowing library cardholders to use library resources ""just in time"", while providing staff with flexibility to schedule training sessions as necessary. 2.2.7 Scheduling of Library Public Access Computers: The proposed software solution must allow machines to be grouped into logical sets, or queues for the purposes of scheduling and must provide a web-based interface that must allow end-user/library customers to reserve the use of a PC from inside the library or from another computer outside the library from the library public web site. This interface provided shall provide a selection of the desired group of computers, a listing of the currently waiting users in anonymous form, and an estimated average waiting time for the next to get a next available reservation. The sign-up page for the web interface described above should only require the enduser/patron to specify a unique identifier, a screen name, and the desired group of computers on which to be scheduled. The web-based schedule sign-up page must allow machine schedule requests to be requested as the next available machine or as a specific machine at a specific date and time. 5   SERIAL 02073-RFP The web-based schedule sign-up page should provide a calendar function to allow patrons library customers to select a date from 365 days a year, seven (7) days per week, or days per week that individual library branch has open hours on upon which to reserve a machine. In addition, the scheduling function must not accept reservations for dates and times on which all available machines have been scheduled or for days when specific branches may not be typically open. The software solution must also provide a Windows-based interface that must allow endusers/patrons to reserve a PC. This interface must provide a selection of the desired group of computers, a listing of the currently waiting users in anonymous form, and an estimated average waiting time for the next to get a next available reservation. The sign-up page for the Windows interface described above must require the enduser/customer to provide their library smart card identification number, a screen name, and a selection from the desired group of computers on which to be scheduled. The Windows-based schedule sign-up page must allow machine schedule requests to be requested as the next available machine or as a specific machine at a specific date and time. The Windows-based schedule sign-up page must provide a calendar function to allow patrons to select a date on which to reserve a machine. In addition, the scheduling function should not accept reservations for dates and times on which all available machines have been scheduled. The software solution must provide a listing of the current status of the user wait list for each group of computers and this list must update automatically to provide current wait list information to the end-users/patrons. The software solution should provide alternative means to displaying the wait list status to patrons that can be seen from at least forty (40) feet by a person with good eyesight. When a machine becomes available, the software solu tion must assign the machine to the next user in the queue and when a machine is assigned to a customer, only the assigned customer must be able to log on to the machine for a period of time to be defined by the administrator/librarian for each computer group. If an end-user/patron does not sign on within this reservation hold period, the machine must be released and assigned to the next user in the queue. If a machine is available with no one currently using the machine, an end-user/patron must be able to sit at the machine and sign on without signing up for a machine reservation. The software solution's scheduling function must recognize this valid log on and not assign this machine to another customer during this customer's session. 2.2.8 Reservation Assignment: When a machine becomes available, the software solution must assign the machine to the next user in the queue and when a machine is assigned to a user, only the assigned user must be able to log on to the machine for a period of time to be defined by the administrator/librarian for each computer group. 6   SERIAL 02073-RFP If an end-user/patron does not sign on within this reservation hold period, the machine must be released and assigned to the next user in the queue. If a machine is available with no one currently using the machine, an end-user/customer must be able to sit at the machine and sign on without signing up for a machine reservation. The software solution's scheduling function must recognize this valid log on and not assign this machine to another user during this user's session. 2.2.9 Abnormal Ending of User Session When a user's session abnormally terminates due to a power failure or other system failure, the software solution must assign the user to the next available machine so that they may complete their session. The software solution must recognize when no one is waiting to use a computer in a scheduling group. If no one is waiting to use a computer in a scheduling group, existing users should be automatically offered extended time. When a user is given automatic extended time, they should notified that they are in extended time mode, and the text of this message must be definable by the administrator/librarian for each group of computers. The administrator/librarian must have the ability to enable/disable automatic extended time on a computer group basis. 2.2.10 Block Scheduling: The software solution must allow an administrator/librarian to schedule a block of specific computers for a specific date and time. When a reservation for a block of computers is assigned to the reserved machines, the computers must be locked to prevent unscheduled users from logging on to the machines. Inserting an administrator's card and entering an appropriate password must release the machine for sign-on by the next user. This must allow a trainer to release machines for use in a class when the students are assembled. 2.2.11 PC Time Management: The software solution must control how much time an end-user may use a machine per day and control how much time an end-user may use a machine per session. If no one is waiting, the software solution must allow end-user/customer to work in extended mode. System software must supply at least two warning messages to alert customers that they have reached the extent of allotted time on the public computer if others are waiting to use existing computer workstations. An administrator/librarian must be able to determine the text of the messages that will appear for the session time out warnings. As described the software solu tion must allow machines to be grouped into logical sets, or queues, and session limits, warning messages, and warning times must have the ability to be set independently for each group of computers. When an end-user/patron session time expires, the software solution must end the user's session and reset the computer to standard settings for that organization. 2.2.12 Session Pause Features: When an end-user/customer ends a session by removing the smart card, the software solution must prompt the customer with an option to pause the session. This option must be provided to the customer upon the removal of the card from the keyboard card reader 7   SERIAL 02073-RFP through an automatic dialog prompt. A dialog prompt should be displayed for a customizable pre-determined period of time. If the user chooses to pause their session, the machine screen must be covered with a pause message for a period of time to be determined by the library. If the user chooses not to pause the session, the session is immediately terminated, and the machine is reset. During a paused session, the user's session clock must continue to run so as not to allow unwarranted session extension. Upon returning to a paused session, the user needs only to re-insert their smart card to resume the session. No other user can use this particular computer during the paused session. The system must reset itself if customer does not return to the specific computer after a pre-specified period of time. The pause message that covers the screen of a paused ses sion must have a field to allow an administrator's/librarian's password to be entered. When an administrator inserts their card and enters an appropriate password, the software solution should unlock the paused machine and end the session making it ready for the next library customer. 2.2.13 PC Reset: When an end-user/patron removes their smart card from the reader, and the user chooses not to pause a session as described above, the system must immediately reset the machines and end the session. Upon the session ending, the software solution must immediately reset the machine by closing all browser windows, clearing the browser cache and clearing the browser history. All open browser windows should close, and the default environment, including cookies, favorites, and browser history should be reloaded on the computer. If the library has a default home page, the software solution must open a browser in preparation for the next user. In addition to closing and resetting all browser windows, the software solution must close all applications, except those applications which may have been defined in an exception list. The software solution must provide an exception list of applications that are not reset and closed upon session reset. 2.2.14 Access Controls: The software solution should provide for an administrator or library-defined set of access control levels. Any number of access control lists can be defined. The access control levels are defined by a categorized list of uniform resource locators (URLs) and with a user defined list (UDL). The UDL in the software must provide GRANT/DENY override rules to the categorized list. The access level can be customized for an individual user, for everyone in an access level, and for everyone in a library or not as the library computer use policy designates. The software solution must provide a set of exception sites to which users can browse without a smart card or authentication. Customers may elect to browse only the library 8   SERIAL 02073-RFP catalog website as an example and might elect not to use other Internet or electronic resources provided by the library. The access control rules can be applied to all Internet communications regardless of the browsing application used, including Microsoft Word, Windows Explorer, and Windows Recycle Bin. The application of the access control rules must not require additional network hardware, such as a Proxy server, to act as a costly gateway or bottleneck to network performance. The application of the access control rules should be Internet Service Provider independent, meaning that access to a particular Internet Service Provider or network subnet addressing must not be required. The software solution should be capable of restricting access to computers based on a library customer's access level. The software must, as defined by the library system administrator change a customer's access to an alternative access level or prevent customers of selected access levels from using the machines. (This can allow the library to grant privileges to a parent or guardian as an example for temporarily restricting access to specific resources, if the library were to provide for such options within a computer acceptable use policy.) 2.2.15 Strong Authentication: The software solution must provide strong two-factor authentication of users and administrators. The secure authentication must use smart card technology to assure the integrity of authentication and provide security of customer information. The authentication process must use a `card present' strategy that immediately indicates that a user has left a machine when the card is removed. The software solution should provide two modes of authentication. In browseauthentication, the software must provide time management and authentication of the user session when the user tries to access an Internet site that is not on the library's exception list. Also, the software solution must apply the user's access level rules and the machine's access level overrides to the user's attempts to browse Internet sites. The software solution must provide a second mode of authentication for authenticate always. In authenticate always mode, the software solution must provide time management and authentication for any application use, unless the application is on an application exception list outlined by the library. The software solution must provide the library with the ability to build an exception list of applications, which can also be accessed without authentication by the end-user/patron.  2.2.16  Reporting Mechanisms: The software solution must provide extensive on-line reports, including but not limited to, financial summaries, financial detail by date, customer financial detail by date, session data by machine by date, and session use by access level by date. Financial reports must provide the option to run the report with customer barcode identification number, customer name or other configuration as determined by data fields available at the discretion of the library. 9   SERIAL 02073-RFP The financial reports must be available for a predefined set of dates and for any custom range of dates. Online financial summary reports must be provided that show the types of transactions, the subtotal amount of each transaction type, and a total of all transactions for the reported time period. From an online financial summary report, an administrator/librarian must be able to select dates or transaction types to get to an online financial detail for the date or transaction type. From the online financial detail, the administrator/librarian must be able to select a detail report for a specific transaction, including transaction date, transaction amount, and user name (if enabled). 2.2.17 Personalization of Customer Services Interface: When customer has securely authenticated, the proposed solution must be able to recognize whether the end-user/patron has opted to enable personalization. Personalization is defined as the ability of a customer at a public computer within the library environment to save individual preferences such as bookmarks or favorite browsing sites on the Internet. If end-user/patron has not opted to enable personalization, the proposed solution should load the default personal profile as defined by the library. If the end-user/patron has opted to enable personalization, the proposed solution should load the users individualized profile. The personal profile must include cookies, favorites, and history for the browser, which has been standardized upon for use by the library. Personal profile functionality should be supported on Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 5.0 and higher and Netscape Version 4.7 and higher. Support of other browsers such as Opera should also be supported.  3.0  SPECIAL TERMS & CONDITIONS: 3.1 CONTRACT LENGTH: This Request for Proposals is for awarding a firm fixed price contract to cover a two (2) year period. 3.2 OPTION TO EXTEND: The County may, at their option and with the approval of the Contractor, extend the period of this agreement up to a maximum of three (3), one (1) year options. The Contractor shall be notified in writing by the Materials Management Department of the County's intention to extend the contract period at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the original contract period. 3.3 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 3.3.1 INDEMNIFICATION To the fullest extent permitted by law, the CONTRACTOR shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials, and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and the cost of appellate proceedings, relating to, arising out of, or alleged to have resulted from the acts, errors, omissions or mistakes relating to the performance of this Contract. CONTRACTOR'S 10   SERIAL 02073-RFP duty to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials, and employees shall arise in connection with any claim, damage, loss or expense that is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, death, or injury to, impairment, or destruction of property, including loss of use resulting therefrom, caused by any acts, errors, omissions or mistakes in the performance of this Contract including any person for whose acts, errors, omissions or mistakes, the CONTRACTOR may be legally liable.

The COUNTY reserves the right to request and to receive, within 10 working days, certified copies of any or all of the herein required insurance policies and/or endorsements. The COUNTY shall not be obligated, however, to review such policies and/or endorsements or to advise CONTRACTOR of any deficiencies in such policies and endorsements, and such receipt shall not relieve CONTRACTOR from, or be deemed a waiver of the COUNTY'S right to insist on strict fulfillment of CONTRACTOR'S obligations under this Contract. The insurance policies required by this Contract, except Workers' Compensation, shall name the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials and employees as Additional Insureds. The policies required hereunder, except Workers' Compensation, shall contain a waiver of transfer of rights of recovery (subrogation) against the COUNTY, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, officials and employees for any claims arising out of CONTRACTOR'S work or service. 3.4.1 Commercial General Liability.
