GX031-20-2349481	Pima County Department of Transportation   Technical Services Division - GIS Database Services   Developing GIS for the Web   Methods for Publishing Spatial Data on the Internet   Map Generators       Map generation process:    Map generators use a browser form.  The user to enters specifications such as location, thematic layers and symbology on the form.  The form is passed to the web server. A gateway at the web server passes the request to a GIS server. For instance, the gateway could pass the request in the form of AML to  an ARC/INFO server. The ARC/INFO server generates a graphics file which is converted to GIF image.  The GIF image is sent back to the client and viewed using native browser capability.     The advantage of map generators is creating custom maps on the fly. Disadvantages include lack of access to the raw spatial data, typically slower, limited predefined user choices, and involved setup. ARC/INFO is not designed for this medium.    Commercial, off-the-shelf solutions for GIS - WWW interfacing  is a list of solutions that might fit into this category.  GRID-Arendal Data and Information sources  shows some of the source's work at the same web site.   Some of the following examples may access large enough databases or respond fast enough to put them in the next category of  real time map browsers  rather than map generators.  Examples of map generators:    The  U.S. Census Bureau 's  Tiger Mapping Service  lets you build a map for any location in the US. You can even  Request TMS maps directly  from your own HTML web pages or CGI script. Use their service to build custom maps for your users on the fly. For instance:  http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapbrowse-tbl?&lon=-110.9&lat=32.2  generates up a browsable, customizable map of the Tucson area.  University of Virginia  SocialSciences Data Server .  BADGER  gives access to San Francisco Bay Area geo-data over the Internet, including vector data superimposed over scalable aerial images.  The following all appear to be based on technology from  Geosystems Global Corporation  with data from  Etak, Inc.     The  Lycos  search site offers   Road Map  which builds customized maps from addresses.  Maps On Us  finds routes and displays maps with route instructions. Cool!  Bigbook  can find businesses and display a map given any address.    MapQuest  is an amazing interactive map and search facility.  Yahoo Maps  is another, similar, map generator.  Netday96  allows you to zoom in on a pin map of participating schools until a text  file describing participation at the school is displayed.    The West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection  has a GIS page with both a West Virginia GIS Data Repository and a WWW On-Line Interactive GIS Service.  GIS-based Air Pollution Modeling on the WWW  is a demonstration of a smokestack air pollution model.  It accepts your input for smokestack parameters and generates contour map of concentrations by linking the web to ARC/INFO to do the analysis.  The  University of Adelaide  in Austrailia has another interactive web interface to ARC/INFO, the  Ecotourism Interactive GIS . You can select features to draw (zoom, pan etc), interrogate park and vegetation data (writes to a report window), connect from drawn map features to hypermedia information (via WWW hot links strategy), and produce an image file.  Xerox PARC MapWeb Server   The  Verde River Watershed  in Arizona offers   Make O' Map .  ForNet MapServer Software  is a freely  available system for generating and displaying maps interactively on the web. Some examples of its use are  BWCAW Internet MapServer ,  Air Photos Online  and  Cooperative Stand Assesment .  They also have an interactive image browser called  ImageView .  University of Virginia Library, Geographic Information Center:  The Virginia County Interactive Mapper   Demographic Data Viewer (DDViewer)  from the    Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) .
