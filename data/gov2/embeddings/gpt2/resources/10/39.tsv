The new Montclair Connection will save half an                            hour each day for more than 4,000 NJ TRANSIT customers                            by providing a direct access to Manhattan during peak                            and off-peak hours.

MidTOWN                            DIRECT will also reduce congestion on roads leading                            into New York City by an estimated 1,000 cars a day.                            The opening of the Montclair Connection highlights our                            efforts to provide a mass transit system that is convenient                            and efficient.

GX035-60-8394520	"View Header     THE WHITE HOUSE                          Office of the Press Secretary   For Immediate Release                                  December 23, 2000                                        December 23, 2000        MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES     SUBJECT:       Resolution of Puerto Rico's Status     Although Puerto Rico was acquired in connection with the Spanish-American War and United States citizenship is granted to persons born on the islands, Puerto Rico's ultimate status has not been determined.  Until that issue is resolved, questions remain about how United States economic and social policies should apply to the citizens of Puerto Rico.    Further, although our citizens in Puerto Rico have been granted the exercise of authority on local matters similar to that of citizens of a State, they do not have voting representation in the Federal Government.    All three of Puerto Rico's major political parties are based on different visions of what the options for a fully democratic status are, and what the best status would be.  And all advocate a substantial change in the islands' status.  The Commonwealth held a referendum on options for its future status in December 1998, including the current governing arrangement, and other recognized options, but a majority of the vote was for a ""None of the Above"" column.    Much of the debate on the issue concerns what options are available to Puerto Rico, in light of the Constitution and the basic laws and policies of the United States.  The elected representatives of the people of Puerto Rico have, therefore, repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government to clarify the islands' status options as well as the process by which Puerto Ricans can determine the islands' future status.    The United States has a responsibility to answer such questions. Successive Presidents, and the Congress in 1998, have supported the people of Puerto Rico in determining their status preference from among options that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States.  I have made it the policy of the executive branch to work with the leaders of the Commonwealth and the Congress to enable Puerto Ricans to choose their future status.  We also have the responsibility to help Puerto Ricans obtain the necessary transitional legislation toward a new status, if chosen.    To ensure that the Federal Government continues to address the fundamental question concerning the islands until it is resolved, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Public Law 106-346, I have today issued an Executive Order establishing the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status (President's Task Force) and further direct as follows:       The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall conduct an      ongoing dialogue with the Governor and Resident Commissioner of      Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico's major political parties and other groups      that advocate a change in the islands' status, and the Chairs and      Ranking Minority Members of the House of Representatives Committee      on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural      Resources.  This dialogue shall focus on the options for Puerto      Rico's future status and the process by which Puerto Ricans can      realize such an option.  It shall seek to facilitate communications      among the offices that the aforementioned officials represent on      matters relating to the status of the Commonwealth, and ensure      official attention to, and facilitate action on, such matters.  In      particular, the dialogue shall seek to clarify the options for      Puerto Rico's future status and enable Puerto Ricans to choose      among those options.     The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall monitor the      expenditure of funds for public education on and a public choice      among Puerto Rico's status options pursuant to Public Law 106-346.      This moni-toring shall include ensuring that educational materials      are accurate, objective, and nonpartisan and that they are      consistent with the standards set forth in the Executive Order      entitled ""Establishment of the President's Task Force on Puerto      Rico's Status.""     The heads of executive departments and agencies shall cooperate      with the Co-Chairs in fulfilling the assignments provided for      herein and in the accompanying Executive Order.
