GX026-55-11390100	"Gregoire: New Tobacco Product Disguised as Candy          OLYMPIA - Attorney General Christine Gregoire today warned that a new          tobacco product made to look like candy could lure young people into nicotine          addiction, and she urged the federal government to regulate the product's          marketing and sales.         The          product, which goes under the name ""Ariva,"" contains compressed          tobacco powder along with sweeteners, mint and other flavorings, and resembles          a brand of popular breath mints already on the market. Ariva is now marketed          in at least 40 states and is expected to be available in Washington soon.         ""We sued tobacco companies to stop them from targeting kids to make          them the next generation of addicted tobacco users,"" Gregoire said.          ""A key element of the tobacco settlement was to limit young people's          exposure to tobacco and the nicotine it contains.""          Gregoire said tobacco products of all kinds kill more than 440,000 Americans          every year and that the nicotine in these products keep children and adults          addicted.         She is one of 42 Attorneys General who today asked the Federal Food and          Drug Administration to regulate Ariva.         ""Ariva may look and taste like a harmless candy mint, but it could          lead to a nicotine addiction and it should be regulated like the dangerous          product it is,"" Gregoire said.          In a letter to the FDA, Attorneys General noted that because the Ariva          looks like a breath mint and does not emit smoke or strong tobacco odors          when used, parents and teachers may not be able to determine if a child          is using the product.         Although its manufacturer publicly claims that Ariva is aimed at current          smokers who are in situations where they can't smoke, Ariva has many features          that appeal to children, including chewing gum-style packaging and candy-like          sweetness.                     The Attorneys General told the FDA that the marketing and packaging for          Ariva falsely implies that the product is a healthy alternative to smoking,          when in fact it contains toxic and cancer-causing substances.          The Attorneys General support a petition calling for FDA regulation of          Ariva that was submitted by numerous public health and medical organizations.          Organizations supporting FDA regulation include: the National Center for          Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer          Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association,          the American Legacy Foundation and numerous other major public health          organizations.         -30-                         Index"

Obesity Research Center: Babcock 1029 St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center 1111 Amsterdam Avenue       New York, NY, 10025                           Introduction   Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I am Dr. Carol Boozer. I  received my doctorate of science in nutrition from Harvard University, School of  Public Health. I am presently on the faculties of the Institute of Human  Nutrition, in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University and at the New  York Obesity Research Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. I  have received research funding from the National Institutes of Health and have  served on NIH study sections and as an NIH site visit reviewer. I currently  receive significant research support from NIH grants. My career has been devoted  to research in the areas of nutrition and obesity with the intention to promote  public health.   Ephedra Studies   Issues relating to ephedra are highly controversial. My interest in this issue  is through my role as a scientist who was the principal investigator in two of  the very few clinical trials of the efficacy for weight loss and safety of  herbal ephedra/caffeine combinations. My position today is to promote the role  of science in the policy making process in general and in this issue in  particular.   The sudden death of any individual is tragic to the family and friends and a  loss to the country. The effort to reduce the number of these tragedies and  promote public health should be the highest priority. Reports of adverse events  related to the use of ephedra must be taken seriously, and they are useful in  pointing to areas that require research. They do not constitute scientific proof  of an association between ephedra consumption and injury. The reason why such  reports cannot prove cause and effect is easily understood by the following  example. If a city is considering whether installation of a traffic light has  reduced accidents at a dangerous intersection, both the accident rate before the  installation, the ""background rate"" and the rate after installation  must be known. However, even if both rates are known, a difference in rates  might not be due to the light itself since other factors such as weather,  condition of the road, or the opening of a bar in the area could affect the  rate. A reduction in the accident rate following installation of the light  cannot, in and of itself, prove that the light caused the change.   Methodology   Scientists have carefully considered the methodology required to show causality.  The ""gold standard"" method in clinical studies is the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization is a process whereby  individuals are assigned to treatment groups in such a way that the two groups  are similar in all other characteristics, except for the treatment under study.  This controls for the possibility of even unknown factors affecting one group  differently from the other. Double-blinding insures impartiality, since  throughout the study neither the participants nor the investigators know the  treatment group of any participant. Finally, inclusion of a placebo group allows  assessment of the background rate, in a group that is similar in all aspects to  the treatment group, except for the treatment under study.   The two clinical trials of ephedra-containing products that I conducted were  both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies undertaken to assess  the efficacy for weight loss and safety of herbal/ephedra combinations. A  statistician not involved in carrying out the studies provided the randomization  codes using a system that would maximize the chance that placebo and treatment  groups would on average be similar in characteristics such as age, body weight,  gender distribution, income, education, etc. Since none of the research staff  involved in the study knew the codes, there was no way that they could bias the  results by treating one group differently from the other during the study. Only  after the study was completed and after the data had been entered into computer  spreadsheets was the code broken by the statistician who analyzed the data. The  data for the group receiving the ephedra was then compared with the data for the  group receiving placebo. Since the groups were similar at the start of the study  and followed the same protocol with the exception of the treatment, herbal  ephedra/caffeine or placebo, any differences that were found could be attributed  to the treatment.   These two studies were the only clinical trials of ephedra and ephedrine that  were given the highest ranking for quality in the recently published Rand  Report.   Results   The two studies together included 234 men and women who were overweight, but  otherwise healthy. Half received herbal ephedra/caffeine and half placebo. One  study continued for 8 weeks, the other for 6 months. In both studies, those  receiving the herbal treatment lost more body weight and body fat and had  improved blood lipids compared with those receiving placebo. No individual in  either study experienced a significant adverse event (defined in the scientific  community as death, heart attack, stroke, etc.). In both studies, the herbal  groups had increased heart rate and slightly increased blood pressure relative  to placebo groups. Heart monitors, used in the 6-month study, showed that herbal  treatment did not increase heart irregularities. Drop-out rates were similar in  the herbal and placebo groups in both studies, but in the 8-week study, the  reasons given for dropping out of the herbal treatment group included more  self-reported side effects (primarily palpitations). In the 6-month study, the  numbers of individuals who dropped out due to side effects were very low and  were similar between the two groups. The side effects reported more frequently  by all subjects in the herbal groups compared with placebo groups were: dry  mouth, insomnia, headache and heartburn.   Reaction   These studies were published in the International Journal of Obesity. &  Prior to publication, experts in the field critically reviewed each paper and  made recommendations to the editor as to the validity of methods, interpretation  of results and scientific importance, a process called peer-review. Subsequent  to publication, there have been attacks on the studies by the media and others.   The public is not well served by suppression of scientific studies. The value of  scientific study does not depend on agreement of outcome with preconceived  expectation. While no study is perfect, these studies were conducted without  pressure from the industry sponsors for a predetermined outcome, as evidenced by  their contractual agreement to publication of results regardless of outcome. The  studies were conducted with impartiality that was assured by the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled design. They were subjected to peer-review and  published in a reputable scientific journal.   Rejection of scientific data in favor of anecdotal stories is inconsistent with  the advancement of knowledge or responsible public health policy. The Rand  Report reviewed approximately 20,000 adverse event reports. They classified  events as ""sentinel"" if they provided three things: 1) documentation  that the event did occur, 2) documentation or toxicological evidence that the  subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the adverse event, and 3)  evidence that an adequate investigation had assessed and excluded other  potential causes. Only 21, approximately 1 in 1,000 reports, reached this level  and only two of these were deaths.   One estimate of ephedra consumption in the United States was 12 million people  in 1999. Among such a large number of people, some adverse events would occur  whether or not individuals were taking ephedra. Data from the U.S. Government's  Division of Vital Statistics estimates the death rate from heart disease alone  to be roughly 1 in 5,500 even in young individuals, age 25-44 years. Among the  millions of people consuming ephedra, the background rate of deaths and other  serious adverse events would be in the thousands, many fold higher than the 21  documented sentinel events. That is why the Rand Report states that  ""classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and  effect relationship.""   While efficacy of ephedra in promoting weight loss is established, it is not my  position that the safety of herbal ephedra is proven for different populations  or with different usage. Additional research would be required to determine  effects in people who are not healthy, or who consume ephedra at levels above  those studied, or for periods longer than six months, or in combination with  prescription or illicit drugs. But, at present, there is no scientific data  proving that consumption of ephedra/caffeine combinations for weight loss are  unsafe, when consumed in accordance with appropriate warning labels.   Additional research on the effects of ephedra on weight loss and in other areas,  such as athletic performance, is clearly needed. I urge those who are  responsible for policy to promote such research and to be guided by its  findings.

According        to Commissioner David Mulligan: ""These products which are often promoted        with claims of increased athletic performance, body building muscle gains,        energy 'boosts' or a natural high, may pose a significant health risk to        consumers.""                 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately        600 adverse events involving ephedra, including a number of deaths that        are actively being investigated. One of these deaths occurred in Massachusetts        and involved the consumption of a thermogenic protein drink containing ma        huang extract marketed over the counter in health food stores to increase        athletic performance and muscle building.                 While some of the herbal products such as ""herbal ecstasy"" are marketed        to appear as ""legal"" alternatives to street drugs, many of the products        such as the one involved in the Massachusetts case, are marketed towards        health-conscious individuals with claims of increased athletic performance,        body building muscle gains and energy boosts. The Department of Public Health        is warning consumers not to consume any of the ecstasy-type products which        are promoted as giving a natural ""high"" similar to illegal street drugs.        Consumers are further cautioned not to consume herbal dietary supplements        containing ephedra for increasing general health or athletic performances        unless they have consulted a physician.                 Ephedrine is a stimulant that can have adverse effects on the heart and        central nervous system ranging from dizziness and rapid heart beat to psychosis        and heart attack. A recently obtained death certificate for the Massachusett's        case indicated that a 23 year old college student died on April 19, 1996,        of a heart problem (myocardial necrosis) associated with ephedrine toxicity        from the ingestion of a protein drink containing ma huang extract. Commissioner        Mulligan stated that ""The Department is pursuing additional information        from the medical community, and is requesting that any cases of adverse        effects related to these products be brought immediately to our attention.""                        Ephedrine is available as a manufactured synthetic drug and is a constituent        of a number of FDA approved medications for use as a bronchodilator, to        make breathing easier, and is most commonly packaged in over-the-counter        drug products.                 The dietary supplements containing ""ephedra"" or ""ma huang"" are not approved        as drugs by the FDA, and their safety is being questioned. A federal law        passed in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)        permits these dietary supplements to be marked without proof of safety.        FDA is only permitted to act after the marketed dietary supplement has been        proven to be unsafe. Due to the growing number of adverse effects reprted        to FDA nationally, including the Massachusetts case, our Department is working        closely with FDA and the medical community to review additional regulatory        actions that may be taken concerning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine,        especially those that might also contain the stimulant caffeine.                 Individuals who have experienced adverse health effects should contact the        Department of Public Health's Division of Food and Drugs at (617) 727-2670.

GX261-32-11554083	"Club Drugs: Herbal Ecstasy What is herbal ecstasy? How is it different from Ecstasy? Herbal ecstasy is a combination of herbs that are legal, cheap, and advertised as a ""natural high."" Herbal ecstasy can be bought over the counter in drug stores, music stores, and shops around the country for approximately $3.00 per pill. http://www.lef.org/fda-museum/3suppress_truth_nutrients/let_092996.html  The active ingredients are caffeine and ephedra, also know as ma huang. Ma huang is a drug that' been used in China for 2000 years to treat breathing problems. s Ibid  Ecstasy, on the other hand is illegal and the active ingredient is MDMA (this stands for methlyenedioxymethamphetamine). Both drugs are stimulants (uppers), though, and basically have the same effects on the body. www.drugfreeamerica.org/clubdrugs  What is the herbal ecstasy high like? Users describe feeling, tingly, relaxed and/or energetic. www.drugfreeamerica.org/hecstasy_faqs.html  What are the effects of herbal ecstasy? Isn' it safer than the illegal t Ecstasy? NO! Ephedrine (the key ingredient in herbal ecstasy) speeds up your heart and central nervous system, just like Ecstasy, and can cause harmful reactions in people with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions. People who are sensitive to ephedrine can suffer from heart attacks, strokes, and seizures when taking the drug, also. Ibid In fact, in 1996 the FDA reported 15 deaths and 395 illnesses related to use of herbal ecstasy. On April 10, of that year, they issued a warning against ""herbal ecstasy"" use. http://ndsn.org/MAY96/HERBAL.html  In addition to heart attacks and seizures, Herbal Ecstasy can also cause psychosis (a lost sense of reality). A Great Britain man suffered from a psychosis after long-term use of Herbal Ecstasy. After being admitted to an emergency room for hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren' there), he hallucinated that someone was trying to t kill him, and jumped from an upstairs window trying to escape his imaginary attacker. http://www.lef.org/fda-museum/3suppress_truth_nutrients/let_092996.html  For more information please contact: ADEPT 405 West Fifth Street, Suite 211, Santa Ana, CA 92701 ( (714) 834-4058  www.oc.ca.gov/hca/public/ADEPT/index/htm"

The Internet is a gateway to information of great diversity in many countries and cultures around the world. Because of its international character, however, there is no external monitoring of the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the user may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive or illegal under U.S. law. The Library cannot police a global network and each individual user must take responsibility for his or her own activities on the Internet and for the activities of his or her children.           Although the Library can not police the Internet, the Harrison Regional Library System will follow and strictly enforce Alabama State Law 13A-12-200.3 that specifically prohibits the dissemination or display of obscene matter. Computers available for public use are filtered to decrease opportunities for display of pornography. The library has provided a private method to allow adult computer users to request by-pass of the libraries filtering system. Technology protection measures may be disabled, as necessary, for bona fide research or other lawful purposes by people aged 18 and older. Requests to by-pass the libraries filtering system will be reviewed by the Director of the Harrison Regional Library to determine that unfiltered access will not violate federal or Alabama State laws.               Minor Children       The Internet is a new opportunity for children to expand their minds and experiences, and to develop skills necessary for the future. The quality of a child's experience will be directly related to a parent's investment in that experience. No individual, company, or government controls or monitors the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the minor child may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive or illegal under U.S. law.    In an attempt to protect young Internet users, minor Children under the age of 18 must have the written permission of their parents or guardians to use the Library’s Internet computers. Children under the age of 8 must be accompanied by a responsible adult. Minor children can not request an opportunity to by-pass the Library’s filtering service.           The Library has installed a filtering service on all library computers with Internet access, and will enforce the operation of same during any use of those computers, to prevent minors from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Filtering software is not foolproof. It diminishes the likelihood that searchers will inadvertently retrieve text or images that they may find offensive, but does not eliminate that possibility.        Parents or legal guardians must assume responsibility for deciding which library resources are appropriate for their own children. Parents or legal guardians should guide their children in use of the Internet and inform them about materials they should not use. While the Library affirms and acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of parents and guardians to monitor and determine their children's access to Library materials and resources, including those available through the Internet, the Library has taken certain measures designed to assist in the safe and effective use of these resources by all minors.   1.                    To address the issue of access by minors to inappropriate material on the Internet, including material that is harmful to minors, the Library:       Ø        Develops and maintains a special web site for children and teens;        Ø        Develops and provides training programs on safe and effective Internet use;        Ø        Encourages staff to guide minors away from materials that may be inappropriate   Ø        Distributes a publication entitled ""Kid’s  Rules for Online Safety .""   2.           To address the issue of the safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications, as well as the unauthorized disclosure, use and dissemination of personal identification information regarding minors, the Library provides training programs and also urges minors to keep in mind the following safety guidelines:       Ø        It  is not acceptable for a minor to receive any material that is deemed harmful to minors under the  Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)  through a web site, email, chat room, or other direct electronic communication.       Ø        Never give out identifying information such as home address, school name, or telephone number.

Ø        Remember that everything one reads may not be true.        3.           To address the issue of unauthorized access, including so-called ""hacking,"" and other unlawful activities by minors online, minors and all other Library users are hereby advised that use of the Library's computers for hacking or any other unlawful activity is strictly prohibited.   Rules Governing Use         Due to the limited resources available for provision of public access to the Internet, the Library may set limits, for example, on use of large files of still or moving images or sound, or on downloading files in any medium. The Library also reserves the right to limit the amount of time an individual user can devote to a single session. The public must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including laws governing the transmission and dissemination of information while accessing the Internet.    Users may not:        ·          Use the network to make unauthorized entry into other computational, informational or communication services or resources.        ·          Distribute unsolicited advertising.        ·          Invade the privacy of others.        ·          Make any attempt to damage computer equipment or software.        ·          Engage in any activity that is harassing or defamatory.        ·          Use the Internet for any illegal activity, including violation of copyright or other rights of third parties, or in a manner inconsistent with the Library's tax-exempt status or its proper operation.        Further examples of unacceptable use include, but are not limited to, the following:        ·          Damaging or destroying equipment, software, or data belonging to the Library or to other users, including adding, altering, or deleting files on Library workstation hard drives or other Library computer equipment.        ·          Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material.        ·          Violating software license agreements.        ·          Violating computer system or network integrity, including attempts to bypass network security functions, obtain passwords, or alter the configuration of Library workstations in any way.        ·          Gambling on the Internet.         ·          Wasting finite resources (including printing without paying).                Violations may result in loss of access. Unlawful activities will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.    Public Users' Security  Users should be aware that the Internet is not a secure medium and that third parties may be able to obtain information regarding users' activities. However, The Harrison Regional Library System will not release information on the use of specific Internet resources by members of the public except as required by law or necessary for the proper operation of the Library.     Compliance       The user’s access to the Library’s computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this policy and its procedures will result in the forfeiture of the user’s right to access these computers.        The Library reserves the right to take appropriate action to insure compliance with this policy.       The Library reserves the right to determine what constitutes inappropriate behavior. The Library reserves the right to terminate the Internet access privileges of any person abusing these principles.                Use of the Library's Internet computers will be on a first-come, first-served basis. No appointments will be taken.       ____________________________________________       Kids' Rules for Online Safety           1.        I will not give out personal information such as my address, telephone number, parents’ work address/telephone number, or the name and location of my school without my parents’ permission.       2.          2.

INTERNET ACCESS This is the Internet Safety Policy of the JCLC, the host site that provides Internet access to the nineteen member libraries of Jefferson County. The Internet, a worldwide network of computer networks is an essential medium for obtaining and transmitting information of all types. Therefore, public access to the Internet is germane to the public Library's mission. However, the Internet is an unregulated medium. It also provides access to information that is inaccurate, illegal or that some may find offensive or disturbing. The JCLC will identify on its web site specific Internet sites that have potential interest for JCLC users. But the JCLC cannot control a user's access to other Internet resources. I. RESPONSIBILITIES OF JCLC USERS AND STAFF JCLC member library staff will not monitor a user's Internet use, except for length of use at a member library site, in order to ensure equal opportunity of access for everyone. The user, or the parent of a minor, is responsible for his or her Internet session at all times. The JCLC member library, through local Internet policies, reserves the right to terminate an Internet session that disrupts JCLC services or that involves user behavior that violates the member library policies or JCLC's policies. As with all JCLC resources, the JCLC affirms the right and responsibility of parents/guardians, NOT JCLC member library staff, to determine and monitor their minor children's use of the Internet. Parents are responsible for their minor children's use of the JCLC's resources and member library's facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the JCLC's Internet access are requested to monitor their children's Internet use.   II. UNACCEPTABLE USES OF NETWORK AND/OR COMPUTERS Among the uses that are considered unacceptable and which constitute a violation of this Policy are the following: A. Uses that violate the law or encourage others to violate the law. Transmitting of offensive or harassing messages; offering for sale or use any substance the possession or use of which is prohibited by law; viewing, transmitting or downloading pornographic materials or materials that encourage others to violate the law; downloading or transmitting confidential, trade secret information, or copyrighted materials. Even if materials on the networks are not marked with the copyright symbol, users should assume that all materials are protected unless there is explicit permission on the materials to use them. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning: · any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; · depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or · simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; · taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Specific to Alabama: A. Dissemination or public display of obscene matter is a misdemeanor in Alabama. Code of Alabama 13A-12-200.3 B. Dissemination or public display of obscene matter containing visual reproduction of person under 17 years of age involved in obscene acts is a Class B felony in Alabama. Code of Alabama 13A-12-191. C. Violation of the above ordinances 13A-12-200.3 and 13A-12-191 may subject you to loss of library privileges or criminal prosecution. D. Copies obtained from the Internet may be subject to copyright law. Violation of the law may subject you to an action for damages and/or an injuction.   B. Uses that cause harm to others or damage to their property. Engaging in defamation (harming another's reputation by lies); uploading a worm, virus, ""trojan horse,"" ""time bomb"" or other harmful form of programming or vandalism; participating in ""hacking"" activities or any form of unauthorized access to other computers, networks, or information systems. C. Uses that jeopardize the security of the computer network or other networks on the Internet. Disclosing or sharing the user's library card password with others; impersonating another user; using one's own software programs on the JCLC member library's computers; altering the JCLC's member library computer settings; damaging or modifying computer equipment or software. D. Uses that compromise the safety and security of minors when using e-mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications: Child less than 16 years of age: Giving others private information about one's self or others, including credit card numbers and social security numbers; arranging a face-to-face meeting with someone one has ""met"" on the computer network or Internet without a parent's permission.   III. INTERNET SAFETY A. General Warning; Individual Responsibility of Parents and Users. All users and their parents/guardians are advised that access to the electronic network may include the potential for access to materials inappropriate for children. Every user must take responsibility for his or her use of the computer network and Internet and stay away from these sites. Parents of minors are the best guides to materials to shun. If a child finds that other users are visiting offensive or harmful sites, he or she should report such use to library staff. B. Personal Safety. In using the computer network and Internet, do not reveal personal information such as your home address or telephone number. Do not use your real last name or any other information which might allow a person to locate you without first obtaining the permission of a parent. Do not arrange a face-to-face meeting with someone you ""meet"" on the computer network or Internet without your parent's permission (child less than 16 years of age). Regardless of your age, you should never agree to meet a person you have only communicated with on the Internet in a secluded place or in a private setting. C. ""Hacking"" and Other Illegal Activities. It is a violation of this Policy to use the public library computer network or the Internet to gain unauthorized access to other computers or computer systems, or to attempt to gain such unauthorized access. Any use which violates state or federal law relating to copyright, trade secrets, the distribution of obscene or pornographic materials, or which violates any other applicable law or municipal ordinance, is strictly prohibited. D. Confidentiality of Library Records; · Code of Alabama 41-8-10. Registration, etc. records of public libraries to be confidential; right of parents to inspect records. · Code of Alabama 36-12-40. Inspection and Copying of Records. Personally identifiable information concerning users may not be disclosed or used in any way on the Internet without the permission of a parent or guardian (of a minor child), or the permission of the user himself/herself. Users should never give out private or confidential information about themselves or others on the Internet, particularly credit card numbers and Social Security numbers. A member library director may authorize the release of directory information, as defined by the Code of Alabama, for internal administrative or planning purposes. Any disclosure of current patron information to legal authorities, as required by law with search warrant or subpoena, must be authorized by the Director of the member library where the search warrant or subpoena is served.   IV. DISCLAIMERS While the JCLC endeavors to provide access to information of the highest quality, the JCLC specifically disclaims any warrant as to the information's accuracy, timeliness, authoritativeness, usefulness or fitness for a particular purpose. The JCLC will have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed through the JCLC's Internet service. Since software and information downloaded from any sources, including the Internet, may contain computer viruses, users are advised to utilize virus-checking software on their home computers. The JCLC is not responsible for damage to users' disks or computers or for any loss of data, damage or liability that may occur from use of the JCLC's member library's computers. V. PROCEDURES The JCLC member library will develop such rules, policies and procedures as are necessary to ensure the fair and reasonable use of Internet access at each local member library facility. VI. RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS The user's access to the JCLC's computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this Policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this Policy if he or she permits another to use his or her library card account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this Policy and its procedures may result in the forfeiture of the user's right to access member library computers.   VII. Adoption Adopted by the Board of Directors of the Jefferson County Library Cooperative _______________________2002.   ***********************************************   2001 - 2002 Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy For The Computer Network  Of    Sample Document --Indian Valley   The Indian Valley Local School District (Ohio)   http://www.ivtv.k12.oh.us/documents/StudAUP01.htm     2001 - 2002 Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy    For The Computer Network Of The    Indian Valley Local School District      The Indian Valley Local School District is pleased to make available to students access to interconnected computer systems within the District and to the Internet, the world-wide network that provides various means of accessing significant educational materials and opportunities.  In order for the School District to be able to continue to make its computer network and Internet access available, all students must take responsibility for appropriate and lawful use of this access. Students must understand that one student’s misuse of the network and Internet access may jeopardize the ability of all students to enjoy such access. While the School’s teachers and other Staff will make reasonable efforts to supervise student use of network and Internet access, they must have student cooperation in exercising and promoting responsible use of this access. Below is the Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy (""Policy"") of the School District and the Data Acquisition Site that provides Internet access to the School District. Upon reviewing, signing, and returning this Policy as the students have been directed, each student will be given the opportunity to enjoy Internet access at School and is agreeing to follow the Policy. If a student is under 18 years of age, he or she must have his or her parents or guardians read and sign the Policy. The School District cannot provide access to any student who, if 18 or older, fails to sign and submit the Policy to the School as directed or, if under 18, does not return the Policy as directed with the signatures of the student and his/her parents or guardians.  Listed below are the provisions of your agreement regarding computer network and Internet use. If you have any questions about these provisions, you should contact the person that your School has designated as the one to whom you can direct your questions.

Active Restriction Measures. The School, either by itself or in combination with the Data Acquisition Site providing Internet access, will utilize filtering software or other technologies to prevent students from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The School will also monitor the online activities of students, through direct observation and/or technological means, to ensure that students are not accessing such depictions or any other material which is inappropriate for minors.  Internet filtering software or other technology-based protection systems may be disabled by a supervising teacher or school administrator, as necessary, for purposes of bona fide research or other educational projects being conducted by students age 17 and older.    The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that  - taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;  - depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals;  - taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors.

All such information files shall be and remain the property of the School District and no user shall have any expectation of privacy regarding such materials.    VI. FAILURE TO FOLLOW POLICY  The user’s use of the computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user who violates this Policy, shall at a minimum, have his or her access to the computer network and Internet terminated, which the School District may refuse to reinstate for the remainder of the student’s enrollment in the School District. A user violates this Policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this Policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet, including any user whose access has been denied or terminated. The School District may also take other disciplinary action in such circumstances.   VII. WARRANTIES/INDEMNIFICATION  The School District makes no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, in connection with its provision of access to and use of its computer networks and the Internet provided under this Policy. It shall not be responsible for any claims, losses, damages or costs (including attorney's fees) of any kind suffered, directly or indirectly, by any user or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) arising out of the user’s use of its computer networks or the Internet under this Policy.

If after you have provided your account information, some or all of the information changes, you must notify the person designated by the School to receive such information.    STUDENT’S AGREEMENT    Every student, regardless of age, must read and sign below:    I have read, understand and agree to abide by the terms of the foregoing Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy. Should I commit any violation or in any way misuse my access to the School District's computer network and the Internet, I understand and agree that my access privilege may be revoked and School disciplinary action may be taken against me.    ____________________________________________ ______________________________  Student name (PRINT CLEARLY) Home phone    ____________________________________________ ______________________________  Student signature Date    ______________________________________________________________________________  Address    User (place an ""X"" in the correct blank): I am 18 or older _____ I am under 18 _____    If I am signing this Policy when I am under 18, I understand that when I turn 18, this Policy will continue to be in full force and effect and agree to abide by this Policy.    PARENT’S OR GUARDIAN’S AGREEMENT    _________________________________  Student’s name   To be read and signed by parents or guardians of students who are under 18:    As the parent or legal guardian of the above student, I have read, understand and agree that my child or ward shall comply with the terms of the School District's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy for the student’s access to the School District's computer network and the Internet. I understand that access is being provided to the students for educational purposes only. However, I also understand that it is impossible for the School to restrict access to all offensive and controversial materials and understand my child’s or ward’s responsibility for abiding by the Policy. I am therefore signing this Policy and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the School, the School District and the Data Acquisition Site that provides the opportunity to the School District for computer network and Internet access against all claims, damages, losses and costs, of whatever kind, that may result from my child’s or ward’s use of his or her access to such networks or his or her violation of the foregoing Policy.

The purpose of this policy is to identify the limitations on this privacy and the general restrictions applying to the use of computers and electronic messaging systems of the District.    Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses  The computers, computer network and messaging systems of the School District are intended for educational uses and work-related communications. Incidental use of the e-mail and voice mail systems by staff members for personal communications is permitted as long as such communications are limited in number, are initiated during non-work periods, and do not interfere with the primary intended uses of the system.  The following are uses which are unacceptable under any circumstances:  the transmission of any language or images which are of a graphic sexual nature  the transmission of jokes, pictures, or other materials which are obscene, lewd, vulgar, or disparaging of persons based on their race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation  the transmission of messages or any other content which would be perceived by a reasonable person to be harassing or threatening  uses that constitute defamation (libel or slander)  uses that violate copyright laws  uses that attempt to gain unauthorized access to another computer system or to impair the operation of another computer system (for example, the transmission of a computer virus or an excessively large e-mail attachment)  any commercial or profit-making activities  any fundraising activities, unless specifically authorized by an administrator    Security and Integrity  Staff members shall not take any action which would compromise the security of any computer, network or messaging system. This would include the unauthorized release or sharing of passwords and the intentional disabling of any security features of the system.  Staff members shall not take any actions which may adversely affect the integrity, functionality, or reliability of any computer (for example, the installation of hardware or software not authorized by the System Administrator).  Staff members shall report to the System Administrator or a School District administrator any actions by students which would violate the security or integrity of any computer, network or messaging system whenever such actions become known to them in the normal course of their work duties. This shall not be construed as creating any liability for staff members for the computer-related misconduct of students.    Right of Access  Although the Board of Education respects the natural desire of all persons for privacy in their personal communications, and will attempt to preserve this privacy whenever possible, the operational and security needs of the District’s computer network and messaging systems require that full access be available at all times. The School District therefore reserves the right to access and inspect any computer, device, or electronic media within its systems and any data, information, or messages which may be contained therein. All such data, information, and messages are the property of the School District and staff members should have no expectation that any messages sent or received on the School District’s systems will always remain private.    AGREEMENT   I have read the ""Network Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy for Staff Members"" relating to staff use of the computers, computer networks, and electronic messaging systems of the School District.  I would like to be given access to the School District’s computer network and any electronic messaging systems is a privilege which may be withdrawn in the event of non-compliance with the above Policy. I agree to comply with the ""Network Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy for Staff Members"" and understand that access to the network and messaging systems is a privilege which may be withdrawn in the event of noncompliance with the above Policy.   ******************************   Sample Document    This is the Offical Internet Use POLICY:    ALACHUA COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT POLICY STATEMENT  INTERNET ACCESS POLICY    Approved by:  Board of Trustees 12/15/99  Governing Board 1/13/00   The Alachua County Library District offers filtered and unfiltered access to the Internet in fulfillment of our mission to ""collect, organize, and make accessible recreational, educational, informational and cultural resources to meet the changing needs of Alachua County residents of all ages, and cultural and economic backgrounds.""* Access is offered equally to all users without charge. In providing public access to the Internet, the Alachua County Library District subscribes to the principles of intellectual freedom expressed in the American Library Association's LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS and FREEDOM TO READ statements and its interpretations of these documents. Library staff will not monitor, control, or restrict anyone's access to equipment or the range of information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law. Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet and other forms of electronic information. Minors who visit the library without a parent or guardian are responsible for their own decisions and behaviors. Users of Library computing resources must comply with federal and state laws, Library rules and policies, and the terms of applicable contracts including software licenses while using Library computing resources. Examples of applicable laws, rules and policies include the laws of libel, privacy, copyright, trademark, obscenity and child pornography; the Florida Computer Crimes Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibit ""hacking,"" ""cracking"" and similar activities. Users who engage in electronic communications with persons in other states or countries or on other systems or networks may also be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions and the rules and policies of those other systems and networks. Users must not use computing resources to gain unauthorized access to local or remote computers or to impair or damage the operations of ACLD computers or networks, PC workstations or peripherals. This includes blocking communication lines and running, installing or sharing virus programs. Deliberate attempts to circumvent data protection or other security measures are not allowed. The Alachua County Library District Code of Conduct applies to the use of all Internet workstations.INTERNET ACCESS DISCLAIMER Provision of this service does not constitute any endorsement by the Alachua County Library District. The Library shall have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed on the Internet from Library equipment. Internet users are reminded that: Not all sources on the Internet provide accurate, complete, or current information. Individuals are responsible for the decision to choose either filtered or unfiltered Internet access. Filtering software does not block all material users might find offensive.Public library workstations are not private or secure. *Alachua County Library District, Long Range Facilities and Service Plan ********* And here's our Internet PROCEDURE. This is what ALA's Intellectual Freedom Office was so thrilled with, especially section 9. ******** PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES USE OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000 The following procedures are designed to facilitate the equitable distribution of electronic resources at all Alachua County Library District locations.1. Computer workstations are designed for use by one person. Exceptions may be made by library staff. 2. Patrons are allowed to download from the Internet to a disk only. Patrons must provide their own disk. 3. Patrons' personal software or hardware may not be used or installed on library equipment. 4. Printing from Internet Workstations is available at a nominal cost to the patron. There is no limit to the number of pages a patron can print. 5. All copyright laws apply to the Internet workstations. Refer patrons with questions to the posted signs at the print release stations and provide copies at the service desk for patron review. 6. Because workstations are located in public areas, what is viewed is not private. Under Florida Statute Chapters 847.011(1) and 847.0133(1), the display of obscene materials to minors, viewing child pornography and the printing of such materials is illegal and punishable. Staff who observe or have patrons report these situations should contact their Department Manager or person-in-charge. Document the incident with a Problem Behavior Report. 7. All standard Internet Workstations are equipped with privacy screens. Staff should remove a privacy screen only upon a patron request. All workstations are set to ""time out"" after a set period of no activity. 8. Patron comments about Internet service or content should be handled through discussion as any other complaint or concern. If patrons wish to formally comment on Internet content, staff should give them a ""Patron Comment on Materials"" form to complete. The completed form will be forwarded to the Automated Services Coordinator within one working day of its receipt by library staff. The Automated Services coordinator will appoint a staff committee to review the challenged internet content in light of the INTERNET ACCESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMER. This committee will then formulate a written recommendation, responding to the patron comment and will forward this recommendation to the Library Director within four (4) weeks of the committee appointment. (This process is similar to the one in place for comments on print and audio-visual materials.) Within one week of receiving the committee's recommendation, the Library Director will prepare a final written response to the patron. This response will be forwarded to the patron and to the Board of Trustees. Comments relating to adding or deleting websites from a filtered workstation will be reviewed and the committee will forward the request to the Library Director who will forward the request to FIRN, if appropriate, and will respond to the patron. At any time, patrons will be able to communicate directly with FIRN from our screens, if they wish to do so. 9. On all Internet workstations, patrons will be able to choose, from a menu, filtered or unfiltered access to the Internet. Library staff will not monitor, control or restrict anyone's access to the range of information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law. Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet and other forms of electronic information. Children who visit the library without a parent or guardian will be responsible for their own decisions and behaviors. 10. When necessary, to facilitate access to high-demand resources, staff in-charge can change the designated login on a workstation. 11. Internet users will have access to Web-based and AFN e-mail, chat and games within the limits of State/Federal law. The Library District does not provide e-mail accounts for users but simply provides access to patrons' existing e-mail accounts ********* And here's our SIGNUP PROCEDURE: ********* PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES SIGN-UP OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000 To ensure equitable access to Internet Workstations for all library users, Branch or Department Managers may deem it necessary to sign-up patrons for Internet use during peak hours. When sign-up is used, all library facilities will adhere to the following guidelines. 1. Patrons must schedule a session for the Internet workstations at the public service desk, using existing sign-up sheets supplied by HQPS. 2. A scheduled session is at least a 30 minute block of time. Sessions are scheduled on the half-hour or hour. Each Branch Manager shall establish a consistent timetable of half hour and/or hourly sessions. Timetables should be compatible with traffic patterns in the library. For example: Timetable A: indicates a peak traffic pattern 2pm-closing Monday - Friday and weekends. 10 am -2 pm Monday-Friday sessions are 1 hour. 2 pm-closing Monday-Friday sessions are 30 minutes Saturday-Sunday sessions are 30 minutes Timetable B: indicates peak traffic pattern all open library hours. 30 minute sessions all open library hours Timetable C: indicates ample available equipment during all open library hours including peak. 1 hour sessions all open library hours 3. Patrons may sign up for the next available session at the end of their 1st session. 4. Scheduled sessions are limited to 2 per person per day. 5. Reservations can be taken, either in-person or on the phone, for same day or next library business day. 6. If a patron does not arrive within 5 minutes after the session is scheduled to begin, library staff can offer it to another patron. 7. Internet Workstations are available during the hours the library is open. In order to facilitate printing, finishing documents, etc. at closing time, the last scheduled session will be one hour before closing. *********** The thing that makes this work is a series of screens designed by our staff where the user has to FIRST, agree to accept our internet policy, and SECOND, choose either filtered or unfiltered use. If you don't accept, OR don't choose to filter or not, you can't get to the Internet. This solution was thought up by a committee of our staff and we all thought it was brilliant. We still do...but of course we still get complaints! -ch Carol Hole Alachua County Library Gainesville, FL chole@exchange.acld.lib.fl.us         ************************* Sample Document #4   Sample Internet Use Policy for CIPA Compliance (portions taken from Newark Public Library, New Jersey State Library, and The Indian Valley [Ohio] Local School District) Mission   The mission of The *** Public Library is to provide for the people of *** an easily available local collection of and global access to the universal record of human thought, wisdom, ideals, information, experiences, and artistic expressions. Internet Access The Internet, a world-wide network of computer networks is an essential medium for obtaining and transmitting information of all types. Therefore, public access to the Internet is germane to the Library's mission. However, the Internet is an unregulated medium. It also provides access to information that is inaccurate, illegal or that some may find offensive or disturbing. The Library will identify on its web site specific Internet sites that have potential interest for Library users. But the Library cannot control a user's access to other Internet resources. Responsibilities of Library Staff and Users Library staff will not monitor a user's Internet use, except for length of use in order to ensure equal opportunity of access for everyone. The user, or the parent of a minor, is responsible for his or her Internet session at all times. The Library reserves the right to terminate an Internet session that disrupts library services or that involves user behavior that violates the Library's policies. As with all Library resources, the Library affirms the right and responsibility of parents/guardians, NOT Library staff, to determine and monitor their minor children's use of the Internet. (Minors are defined in this policy as children and young people under the age of 17 years.) Parents are responsible for their minor children’s use of the Library’s resources and facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the Library’s Internet access are requested to monitor their children’s Internet use.Disclaimers While the Library endeavors to provide access to information of the highest quality, the Library specifically disclaims any warrant as to the information's accuracy, timeliness, authoritativeness, usefulness or fitness for a particular purpose. The Library will have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed through the Library's Internet service. The Library, having installed and enforced the operation of filtering software in compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act, will have no liability for damages related to the operation of, or failure of, the filtering software, or for its circumvention by users.Since software and information downloaded from any sources, including the Internet, may contain computer viruses, users are advised to utilize virus checking software on their home computers. The Library is not responsible for damage to users' disks or computers or for any loss of data, damage or liability that may occur from use of the Library's computers. Unacceptable Uses of Computers Among the uses that are considered unacceptable and which constitute a violation of this policy are the following: 1. Uses that violate the law or encourage others to violate the law. Transmitting of offensive or harassing messages; offering for sale or use any substance the possession or use of which is prohibited by law; viewing, transmitting or downloading pornographic materials or materials that encourage others to violate the law; downloading or transmitting confidential, trade secret information, or copyrighted materials. Even if materials on the networks are not marked with the copyright symbol, users should assume that all materials are protected unless there is explicit permission on the materials to use them. 2. Uses that cause harm to others or damage to their property. Engaging in defamation (harming another's reputation by lies); uploading a worm, virus, ""trojan horse,"" ""time bomb"" or other harmful form of programming or vandalism; participating in ""hacking"" activities or any form of unauthorized access to other computers, networks, or information systems. 3. Uses that jeopardize the security of access of the computer network or other networks on the Internet. Disclosing or sharing the user’s password with others; impersonating another user; using one’s own software programs on the library's computers; altering the Library’s computer settings; damaging or modifying computer equipment or software.4. Uses that compromise the safety and security of minors when using e-mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications: Minors under age 17: Giving others private information about one’s self or others, including credit card numbers and social security numbers; arranging a face-to-face meeting with someone one has ""met"" on the computer network or Internet without a parent’s permission. 5. Uses that Violate Confidentiality of Information: The New Jersey Confidentiality of Library Records Law (NJSA 18A:73-43.2) prohibits unauthorized disclosure, use, or dissemination of personal information regarding Library users, including minors. Personally identifiable information about users may not be disclosed or used in any way, except to law enforcement authorities as provided in the law.Technology Protection Measures The Library, either by itself or in combination with its Internet access provider, will install filtering software or other technologies on all library computers with Internet access, and will enforce the operation of same during any use of those computers, to prevent minors from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Filtering software is not foolproof. It diminishes the likelihood that searchers will inadvertently retrieve text or images that they may find offensive, but does not eliminate that possibility. Filters often block access to sites that users would consider both inoffensive and useful. If you do not find what you need, please do not hesitate to ask a librarian for help. Technology protection measures may be disabled by a library staff member, as necessary, for bona fide research or other lawful purposes by people aged 17 and older. Procedures The Library staff will develop such rules and procedures as are necessary to ensure the fair and reasonable use of Internet access. Response to Violations The user’s access to the Library’s computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this policy and its procedures will result in the forfeiture of of the user’s right to access these computers.       From:  Heather Gallegos-Rex, Director Library Development Services / New Mexico State Library / 1209 Camino Carlos ReySanta Fe, NM 87505 / voice: 505-476-9720 / fax: 505-476-9721    Mythical Public Library   Mythical, New Mexico INTERNET AND COMPUTER ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY PURPOSE STATEMENT    The Mythical Public Library provides access to the Internet as one means of fulfilling its mission to ""inform, educate, entertain, and culturally enrich by providing books and other Library resources, facilities and professional services for use by all individuals…."" [Mission Statement, approved by the Advisory Board of Mythical Public Library on February 17,1992]. All Internet resources accessible through the Library are provided equally to all users, with the understanding that it is the individual user’s responsibility to demonstrate judgment, respect for others, and appropriate conduct while using Public Library resources and facilities.Internet computers will not be used by anyone, including minors, for illegal activity, to access illegal materials, or to access materials that by local community standards would be obscene. Library employees are authorized to take prompt and appropriate actions to enforce the Rules of Conduct, and/or to prohibit use by persons who fail to comply with the Internet Acceptable Use Policy as stated or implied herein. Parents are responsible for their children’s use of the Library’s resources and facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the Library’s Internet access are requested to monitor their children’s Internet use.RULES OF CONDUCT Internet computers will not be used for illegal activity, to access illegal materials, or to access materials that by local community standards would be obscene.Installation, downloading, or modification of software is prohibited. Users will respect copyright laws and licensing agreements. Users will not make any attempt to gain unauthorized access to restricted files or networks, or to damage or modify computer equipment or software. Prompt payment is required by users who incur charges for printing or other authorized fees. Users must sign up to use the Internet on a next-available-terminal basis. Terminals will not be ""reserved"" for persons who are not in the immediate vicinity when their name is called, and telephone reservations will not be taken. Access sessions will be limited to thirty minutes, unless otherwise authorized by the Librarian in Charge. Users must end their session and leave the terminal when asked to do so by authorized Library staff, even if they have not completed their access session. Upon completion of an Internet access session, a user may be required to wait 30 minutes before signing up for another session. The Librarian in Charge may establish the number of access sessions available per day, per user; such limitations will be dependent on facility-specific demand in order to provide access for a variety of users. Users will respect the privacy of other users, and will refrain from attempting to view or read material being used by others. The New Mexico Library Privacy Act prohibits unauthorized disclosure, use, or dissemination of personal information regarding Library users, including minors. By mutual agreement, two persons may share one access session as long as their behavior or conversation does not disturb other users or Library staff. OPTIONAL USE OF FILTERED SEARCH ENGINES (Note: Include this paragraph if you intend to use filters.)The Mythical Public Library supports the right and responsibility of parents to direct the use of the Internet by their own children, and provides access to filtered search engines on Internet terminals. Filtered search engines (which are not under the control of the Library) may restrict access to sites that could be deemed objectionable, but may also limit access to sites that have legitimate research value. No filtering system is completely effective or efficient. Access to filtered search engines has been provided, but Library staff will not require that children utilize filtered search engines for their research. Adults doing bona fide research may request that filters be disabled. TERMINATION OR PROHIBITION OF USER ACCESS When Library employees believe that the user has failed to comply with the Internet Acceptable Use Policy and/or the Rules of Conduct, they are authorized to terminate any user’s access session or to prohibit a user from subsequent access sessions for up to two weeks from the date of informing the user of that action. After a hearing before the Library’s administrative authority, a Library patron may be permanently barred from Internet access from the Library.Internet users whose access session has been terminated or prohibited will be given information concerning the process to protest the action and/or request that Internet access privileges be reinstated. Temporary or permanent denial of Internet privileges at any Mythical Public Library facility will be effective at all Mythical Public Library facilities.              Last updated 07/29/2003       by Theresa C.

Conclusion; Severability 182       Preliminary Statement     This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of  filtering software by public libraries a condition of the receipt of federal  funding. The Internet, as is well known, is a vast, interactive medium based on  a decentralized network of computers around the world. Its most familiar feature  is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a network of computers known as servers that  provide content to users. The Internet provides easy access to anyone who wishes  to provide or distribute information to a worldwide audience; it is used by more  than 143 million Americans. Indeed, much of the world's knowledge accumulated  over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately  10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries. And  approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide public  access to the Internet.   While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the  amount of information available to its users is self-evident, its low entry  barriers have also led to a perverse result - facilitation of the widespread  dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults  who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or child  pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quite  harmful. The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record  before us demonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages  11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings. There  are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed for free and  without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web  sites contain child pornography.    Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number  of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content  while also enabling patrons to find the content they desire. Some libraries have  trained patrons in how to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or  have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sites that librarians have  reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing the computer  monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap on  the shoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy. Still others,  viewing the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians  do not wish to confront patrons), have purchased commercially available software  that blocks certain categories of material deemed by the library board as  unsuitable for use in their facilities. Indeed, 7% of American public libraries  use blocking software for adults. Although such programs are somewhat effective  in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are blunt instruments that not  only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amounts of content  that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation,  ""overblock,"" i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library  boards do not wish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected.     Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block  sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include in their physical  collection copies of volumes such as  The Joy of Sex  and  The Joy of  Gay Sex , which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions,  filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information  about health and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One  teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library was the only  venue in which she could obtain information important to her about her own  sexuality. Another library patron witness described using the Internet to  research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast  surgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for health and  education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking  constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the  filtering software on which the parties presented evidence in this case  overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be  mistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and  sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or inappropriate for  adults or minors.    The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards,  enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA""),  Pub. L. No. 106-554 , which  makes the use of filters by a public library a condition of its receipt of two  kinds of subsidies that are important (or even critical) to the budgets of many  public libraries - grants under the Library Services and Technology Act,   20 U.S.C. § 9101  et  seq.  (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" for  Internet access and support under the Telecommunications Act,    47 U.S.C. § 254 . LSTA grant funds are awarded,  inter alia , in order to: (1)  assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks, and (2)  provide targeted library and information services to persons having difficulty  using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children  from families with incomes below the poverty line. E-rate discounts serve the  similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and libraries in  low-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTA  funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection  measure"" that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are  ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" or in the case of minors, ""harmful to minors.""  20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-rate).     The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations,  library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit against the United  States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional    because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons'  First Amendment rights contrary to the requirements of  South Dakota v.  Dole , 483 U.S. 203 (1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish  their First Amendment rights as a condition on the receipt of federal funds and  is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.   In arguing that CIPA will induce  public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that  given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively  require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access  to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these  content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public forum  doctrine,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of  Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they  are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less  restrictive alternatives would further that interest,  see   Reno v.  ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997). (1)   The government responds  that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since  it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply  with CIPA's conditions. Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the  First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated  only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions  without violating the First Amendment.   Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the  issues.  Pub. L. No.  106-554 .   Following an intensive  period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow public libraries to know  whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive  subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at which  we heard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and  documents. The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently  available filtering software. The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not  only that filtering programs bar access to a substantial amount of speech on the  Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but  also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet  content while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech.     As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs  demonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protected speech are wrongly  blocked by the four leading filtering programs, and these pages represent only a  fraction of Web pages wrongly blocked by the programs. The plaintiffs' evidence  explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and vendors of filtering  software are legion. The Web is extremely dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million  new pages added every day   and the contents of existing Web  pages changing very rapidly. The category lists maintained by the blocking  programs are considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable  to customers or the general public for review, so that public libraries that  select categories when implementing filtering software do not really know what  they are blocking.   There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from  extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail.  They center on the limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1)  accurately collect Web pages that potentially fall into a blocked category  (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize Web pages that they have  collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have  previously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints on the technology of  automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review,  including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail   infra  at 58-74. One failure of critical importance is that the  automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web pages for  classification are able to search only text, not images. This is crippling to  filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions""  that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires. As  will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size,  rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art  of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither  underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.    The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software  is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it  successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering  companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends  that no more is required. In its view, so long as the filtering software  selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribed by  CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under the  applicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a  facial challenge. Central to the government's position is the analogy it  advances between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library to  determine which materials to purchase for its print collection. Public libraries  have finite budgets and must make choices as to whether to purchase, for  example, books on gardening or books on golf. Such content-based decisions, even  the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and not a stricter  form of First Amendment scrutiny. In the government's view, the fact that the  Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in  effect, purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography)  it does not want, should not mean that it is chargeable with censorship when it  filters out offending material.   The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set  is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the  constitutional limitations on Congress's spending clause power, the  unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First  Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth.    There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the  most logical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is   South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203 (1987).  Dole  outlines four  categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending  Clause, but the only  Dole  condition disputed here is the fourth and  last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate  discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons. As will appear,  the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable  to a public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access.  Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend,  or only rational basis review, as the government contends, depends on public  forum doctrine.   The government argues that, in providing Internet access,  public libraries do not create a public forum, since public libraries may  reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from availing themselves of the  forum. Accordingly, the government contends that public libraries' restrictions  on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basis review.     Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict  speech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in  public libraries, is not unlimited,   and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private  speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict  access to speech in that forum . We agree with the  plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons'  Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny. In providing even filtered  Internet access, public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker  around the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a  virtually unlimited number of topics. Where the  state provides access to a ""vast democratic  forum[],""  Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997), open to any member of  the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,""  id.  at  870 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision  selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the state disfavors  is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the  marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated. Application of strict  scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries'  provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a  manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and  parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict  scrutiny.   Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering  software is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling  government interest and no less restrictive alternative would serve that  interest. We acknowledge that use of filtering software furthers public  libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual  depictions of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material  harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from  being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content on  the Internet.    We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing  that it would be desirable if there were a means to ensure that public library  patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being  insulated from materials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is not  available in this less than best of all possible worlds. No category definition  used by the blocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all events,  filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial amount of content on  the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. As will appear, we  credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the  blocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of  effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA  without overblocking a substantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis was  supported by extensive record evidence. As noted above, this inability to  prevent both substantial amounts of underblocking and overblocking stems from  several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering  companies use to gather and review Web pages, limitations on resources for human  review of Web pages, and the necessary error that results from human review  processes.   Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block  access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech whose  suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a  public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any  of these interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that further  the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of  obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing  patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit  content. To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene  and child pornography, public libraries may enforce Internet use policies that  make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to  access illegal speech. Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who  violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law  enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictive alternatives to filtering  that further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual  depictions that are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or  presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to  terminals within view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacy  screens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals  outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to  prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit content on  the Internet.   In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications  of the overblocking problem, the government falls back on the ability of the  libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions,  see   CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)),  CIPA §1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)) , to  unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. The evidence  reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters when a patron so  requests. But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Web  site to be unblocked will deter many patrons because they are embarrassed, or  desire to protect their privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking  may take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are  often less well staffed than main libraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling  provisions do not cure the constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use  of Internet filters.    Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that  the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them  to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is  facially invalid, even under the standard urged on us by the government, which  would permit us to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a  single public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the  First Amendment. In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology  mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will  necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected  speech, in violation of the First Amendment. Given this conclusion, we need not  reach plaintiffs' arguments that CIPA effects a prior restraint on speech and is  unconstitutionally vague. Nor do we decide their cognate unconstitutional  conditions theory, though for reasons explained  infra  at note 36, we  discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length.    For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections  1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid  under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from  enforcing those provisions.          Findings of  Fact             Statutory      Framework                       Nature and Operation of        the E-rate and LSTA Program s     In the Telecommunications Act of 1996  (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") to  take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure  the delivery of affordable telecommunications service to all Americans. This  system, referred to as ""universal service,"" is codified in section 254 of the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act.  See  47 U.S.C. §  254. Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service  support mechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers,  schools and libraries, and rural health care providers.  See  47 U.S.C. §  254(h)(1). The extension of universal service to schools and libraries in  section 254(h) is commonly referred to as the Schools and Libraries Program, or  ""E-rate"" Program.   Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll  telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide  request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal  service . . ., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools,  and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged  for similar services to other parties."" 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC  regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain  exceptions,  see  47 C.F.R. § 54.706(d)), must contribute a portion  of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that are providing  services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in section 254. To be  eligible for the discounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from  a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology  Act,  see infra ; (2) be funded as an independent entity, completely  separate from any schools; and (3) not be operating as a for-profit business.   See  47 C.F.R. § 54.501(c). Discounts on services for eligible libraries  are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%,  depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an  urban or rural area.  See  47 C.F.R. § 54.505. Currently, a library's  level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible  for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the  library is located.   The Library Services and Technology Act  (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9101   et seq. , was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Omnibus  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208. The LSTA  establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library  services across the nation. Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds  are awarded,  inter alia , in order to assist libraries in accessing  information through electronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring or  sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies.  See  20  U.S.C. § 9141(a). Through the Grants to States program, LSTA funds have been  used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computers  located in libraries.                      CIPA          The Children's Internet Protection Act  (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001,  which consolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, including the  Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was a part.  See  Pub. L.  No. 106-554 .  CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding  programs: (1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,  see  CIPA § 1711  (amending Title 20 to add § 3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of  libraries,  see  CIPA § 1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services  Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9134); and (3) discounts under the E-rate program,  see   CIPA § 1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Act of 1934, 47  U.S.C. § 254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply to  libraries, are at issue in this case.   As explained in more detail below, CIPA  requires libraries that participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify  that they are using software filters on their computers to protect against  visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful to minors. CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters for  patrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not  permitted for minor patrons if the library receives E-rate discounts.                               CIPA's Amendments to          the E-rate Program    Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes  conditions on a library's participation in the E-rate program. A library ""having  one or more computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount  rates,"" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the  library certifies that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that  includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of  its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such  computers to visual depictions that are - (I) obscene; (II) child pornography;  or (III) harmful to minors,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such  technology protection measure during any use of such computers by minors."" CIPA  § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B)). (2)   CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific technology that  blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . . child  pornography, . . . or harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1703(b)(1) (codified at 47  U.S.C. § 254(h)(7)(I)).   To receive E-rate discounts, a library  must also certify that filtering software is in operation during adult use of  the Internet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify  that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of  a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with  Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual  depictions that are - (I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is  ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of  such computers."" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. §  254(h)(6)(C)).   Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the  FCC has concluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by  staff and those accessible to the public.""  In re Federal-State Joint Board  on Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection Act , CC Docket No.  96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30 (Apr. 5, 2001).    With respect to libraries receiving  E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]n administrator, supervisor,  or other person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the  technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable  access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."" CIPA §1721(b) (codified  at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)).                               CIPA's Amendments to          the LSTA Program     Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum  and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)) to provide that no funds made  available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the  Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet,""  unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety  that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to  any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through  such computers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,""  and, when the computers are in use by minors, also protects against access to  visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)).  Section 1712 contains definitions of ""technology  protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmful to minors,""  that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governing the  E-rate program. CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(7));  see  also   supra  note 2.   As under the E-rate program, ""an  administrator, supervisor or other authority may disable a technology protection  measure . . . to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes.""  CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)). Whereas CIPA's amendments to  the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or other lawful  purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both  adults and minors.             Identity of the Plaintiffs                       Library and Library        Association Plaintiffs     Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association,  California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read  Foundation, Maine Library Association, New England Library Association, New York  Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit  organizations whose members include public libraries that receive either E-rate  discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of Internet access. Because it is a  prerequisite to associational standing, we note that the interests that these  organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central to their  raison  d'être .    Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional  Library District, in southwest Washington state; Multnomah County Public  Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk,  Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, in Santa Cruz,  California; South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison,  Wisconsin; and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York,  are public library systems with branch offices in their respective localities  that provide Internet access to their patrons.    The Fort Vancouver Regional Library  District, for over three years from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants  and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Multnomah County Public  Library received $70,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access this year, and  has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcoming year. The Norfolk  Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access  this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labs in eight  of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received  $20,560 in E-rate discounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS received  between $3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access.     The Fort Vancouver Regional Library  District Board is a public board whose members are appointed by elected county  commissioners. The Multnomah County Library is a county department, whose board  is appointed by the county chair and confirmed by the other commissioners. The  SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governed statutory member public  libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by state law. The governing  body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consists of 20 members  nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors.                       Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs      Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now,  Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania  Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizations whose members include  individuals who access the Internet at public libraries that receive E-rate  discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internet access. We note for  the purpose of associational standing that the interests that these  organizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their  purposes.   Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown,  Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next  friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by her next friend  Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C. Williams, and Quiana  Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adults and minors  who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge,  do not filter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of these plaintiffs do  not have Internet access from home.   Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who  uses the Multnomah County Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet  at the Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relating to her sexual  identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or school computer for this research, in  part because she wished her searching to be private. Although the library  offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did not use  that option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking  information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and  lesbian issues.   Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet  at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breast cancer and reconstructive  surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Mr. Brown's research at the  library provided him and his mother with essential information about his  mother's medical condition and potential treatments.                      Web Publisher        Plaintiffs     Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc., based in  Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a health education Web site,  www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the president and medical director of  Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island and a  clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University.  AfraidtoAsk.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health  issues, often of a sexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male  and female genitalia, and birth control, sought by people of all ages who would  prefer to learn about sensitive health issues anonymously, i.e., they are  ""afraid to ask ."" As part of its educational mission,  AfraidtoAsk.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey  information. Its primary audience is teens and young adults. Based on survey  data collected on the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24  years old and a quarter are under 18. AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several  leading blocking products as containing sexually explicit content.   Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that  contains information about its activities and objectives, including its mission  to protect the reproductive choices of women and men. Plaintiff Planned  Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national  voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care. Planned  Parenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of  information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of  sexually transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to  information about the drug Mifepristone. Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site  that offers free educational information on how to practice safer  sex.   Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an  online content provider that owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay,  lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide. Plaintiff PlanetOut  Corporation is an online content provider for gay, lesbian, bisexual and  transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist Action Committee (""NAC"") is the  nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a private organization that  promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity. The NAC Web site  provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state and local  laws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice  Naturism, and includes nude photographs of its members.   Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the  2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Fifth District of Mississippi (and is  running again in 2002). He publishes a Web site that communicates information  about his campaign and that provides information about his political views and  the Libertarian Party to the public. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the  Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Third  District of Oregon. He operates a Web site that is now promoting his candidacy  for Congress in 2002. (3)             The Internet                       Background     As we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive  medium consisting of a decentralized network of computers around the world. The  Internet presents low entry barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or  distribute information. Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines  or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for those with access to it to  communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least 400 million  people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans were  using the Internet as of September 2001. Nat'l Telecomm. & Info. Admin.,   A Nation Online: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet   (February 2002),  available at    http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/ .   The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a  network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content  accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer  connected to the Internet can search for and retrieve information stored on Web  servers located around the world. Computer users typically access the Web by  running a program called a ""browser"" on their computers. The browser displays,  as individual pages on the computer screen, the various types of content found  on the Web and lets the user follow the connections built into Web pages   - called ""hypertext links,""  ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links"" - to additional content. Two popular browsers are  Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.    A ""Web page"" is one or more files a  browser graphically assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests  content over the Internet. A Web page may contain a variety of different  elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user can fill  in, and links to other Web pages. A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in  several different ways. It may refer to all of the pages and resources available  on a particular Web server. It may also refer to all the pages and resources  associated with a particular organization, company or person, even if these are  located on different servers, or in a subdirectory on a single server shared  with other, unrelated sites. Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of  entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages on the same Web site  or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relating to  a variety of subjects are available through many Web sites.    Users may find content on the Web using  engines that search for requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, a  search engine will display a list of Web sites that may contain relevant content  and provide links to those sites. Search engines and directories often return a  limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the Google search engine  will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found, for  example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria).    A user may also access content on the  Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the  browser. A URL is an address that points to some resource located on a Web  server that is accessible over the Internet. This resource may be a Web site, a  Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource. A URL can be  either a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain  name"" address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP  address. A typical IP address looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL  "" http://13.1.64.14 /"" into a browser will bring the user to the Web server  that corresponds to that address. For convenience, most Web servers have  alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IP addresses. For example,  typing in "" http://www.paed.uscourts.gov "" will  bring the user to the same Web server as typing in  "" http://204.170.64.143 .""    Every time a user attempts to access  material located on a Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web  browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory of  domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domain name  address into an IP address. That IP address is then used to locate the Web  server from which content is being requested. A Web site may be accessed by  using either its domain name address or its IP address.    A domain name address typically consists  of several parts. For example, the alphanumeric URL  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions  can be broken  down into three parts. The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will  use in accessing the content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol);  next is the name of the host server on which the information is stored (e.g.,   www.paed.uscourts.gov ); and then the name of the particular file or  directory on that server (e.g.,  /documents/opinions ).   A single Web page may be associated with  more than one URL. For example, the URLs  http://www.newyorktimes.com  and   http://www.nytimes.com  will both take the user to the  New York  Times  home page. The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred to  as that Web site's root directory or root URL. For example, in   http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents , the  root URL is  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov . There may be hundreds or thousands  of pages under a single root URL, or there may be one or only a few.   There are a number of Web hosting  companies that maintain Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which  can lead to vast amounts of diverse content being located at the same IP  address. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in some cases, for  free, allowing any individual with Internet access to create a Web site. Some  hosting services are provided through the process of ""IP-based hosting,"" where  each domain name is assigned a unique IP number. For example,  www.baseball.com  might map to the IP  address ""10.3.5.9"" and  www.XXX.com   might map to the IP address ""10.0.42.5."" Other hosting services are provided  through the process of ""name-based hosting,"" where multiple domain name  addresses are mapped to a single IP address. If the hosting company were using  this method, both  www.baseball.com  and  www.XXX.com  could map to a single IP address, e.g., ""10.3.5.9.""  As a result of the ""name-based hosting"" process, up to tens of thousands of  pages with heterogeneous content may share a single IP address.                      The Indexable Web, the        ""Deep Web""; Their Size and Rates of Growth and Change          The universe of content on the Web that  could be indexed, in theory, by standard search engines is known as the  ""publicly indexable Web."" The publicly indexable Web is limited to those pages  that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that is recognized  by a search engine. This limitation exists because online indexing techniques  used by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and  AltaVista, are based on ""spidering"" technology, which finds sites to index by  following links from site to site in a continuous search for new content. If a  Web page or site is not linked by others, then spidering will not discover that  page or site.    Furthermore, many larger Web sites  contain instructions, through software, that prevent spiders from investigating  that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannot be indexed using  spidering technology. Because of the vast size and decentralized structure of  the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the  publicly indexable Web. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the  content currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search  engines and directories combined. No currently available method or combination  of methods for collecting URLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the  Web.   The portion of the Web that is not  theoretically indexable through the use of ""spidering"" technology, because other  Web pages do not link to it, is called the ""Deep Web."" Such sites or pages can  still be made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for  example, using individual or mass emailings (also known as ""spam"") to distribute  the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web links that  cannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers. ""Spamming"" is a  common method of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit  content that is not indexable.   Because the Web is decentralized, it is  impossible to say exactly how large it is. A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1  million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historical rate of growth, would  have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001. Estimates of the  total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable  estimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standard  search engines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any  measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing. The indexable  Web is growing at a rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day. The size of  the un-indexable Web, or the ""Deep Web,"" while impossible to determine  precisely, is estimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexable  Web.    In addition to growing rapidly, Web  pages and sites are constantly being removed, or changing their content. Web  sites or pages can change content without changing their domain name addresses  or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an average life span of approximately  90 days.                     The        Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web      There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material available via the  Internet and the Web.   Sexually explicit material on the Internet is   easy to access using any public  search engine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista.   Although  much of the sexually explicit material available on the Web is posted on  commercial sites that require viewers to pay in order to gain access to the  site, a large number of sexually explicit sites may be accessed for free and  without providing any registration information. Most importantly, some Web sites  that contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and therefore  can be reached accidentally.  A  commonly cited example is   http://www.whitehouse.com . Other  innocent-sounding URLs that retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions  include  http://www.boys.com ,  http://www.girls.com ,   http://www.coffeebeansupply.com , and  http://www.BookstoreUSA.com .   Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit material  often use a technique of attaching pop-up windows to their sites, which open new  windows advertising other sexually explicit sites without any prompting by the  user. This technique makes it difficult for a user quickly to exit all of the  pages containing sexually explicit material, whether he or she initially  accessed such material intentionally or not.    The percentage of Web pages on the  indexed Web containing sexually explicit content is relatively small. Recent  estimates indicate that no more than 1-2% of the content on the Web is  pornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute number of Web sites  offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately  100,000 sites.              American Public Libraries         The more than 9,000 public libraries  in the United States are typically funded (at least in large part) by state or  local governments. They are frequently overseen by a board of directors that is  either elected or is appointed by an elected official or a body of elected  officials. We heard testimony from librarians and library board members working  in eight public library systems in different communities across the country,  some of whom are also plaintiffs in this case. They hailed from the following  library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville,  South Carolina; a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison,  Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk, Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and  Westerville, Ohio. The parties also took depositions from several other  librarians and library board members who did not testify during the trial, and  submitted a number of other documents regarding individual libraries'  policies.                     The Mission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection        Development Practices     American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities,  and it is not surprising that they do not all view their mission identically.  Nor are their practices uniform. Nevertheless, they generally share a common  mission -  to provide patrons  with a wide range of information and ideas.    Public libraries across the country  have endorsed the American Library Association's (""ALA"") ""Library Bill of  Rights"" and/or ""Freedom to Read Statement,"" including every library testifying  on behalf of the defendants in this case.  The ""Library Bill of Rights,"" first adopted by  the ALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that ""[b]ooks and other library  resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of  all people of the community the library serves."" It also states that libraries  ""should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on  current and historical issues"" and that library materials ""should not be  proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.""     The ALA's ""Freedom to Read""  statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updated in July 2000, states, among  other things, that ""[i]t is in the public interest for publishers and librarians  to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those  that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority."" It also states that ""[i]t  is the responsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon  th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own  standards or tastes upon the community at large.""    Public libraries provide information  not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and  other purposes.  For example,  Ginnie Cooper, Director of the Multnomah County Library, testified that some of  the library's most popular items include video tapes of the British Broadcasting  Corporation's ""Fawlty Towers"" series, and also print and ""books on tape""  versions of science fiction, romance, and mystery novels. Many public libraries  include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, such as  The  Joy of Sex  and  The Joy of Gay Sex . Very few public libraries,  however, collect more graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated  videos, or  Hustler  magazine. (4)   The mission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a  wide array of information, and they surely do so. Reference librarians across  America answer more than 7 million questions weekly. If a patron has a  specialized need for information not available in the public library, the  professional librarian will use a reference interview to find out what  information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for which an item  will be used. Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging  the patron's purpose in seeking information, or the content of the information  that the patron is seeking.    Many public libraries routinely  provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the  use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs. Public  libraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining access to all materials  except those that are illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in  their physical collection.    In order to provide this  access, a librarian may attempt to find material not included in the library's  own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or  through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore.  Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently.     Public librarians also apply  professional standards to their collection development practices. Public  libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies  governing collection development at the local level. Collection development is a  key subject in the curricula of Masters of Library Science programs and is  defined by certain practices. In general, professional standards guide public  librarians to build, develop and create collections that have certain  characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisite and appropriate  quality. To this end, the goal of library collections is not universal coverage,  but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefit  or interest to the community. In making selection decisions, librarians consider  criteria including the content of the material, its accuracy, the title's niche  in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of the author, the  publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material  available in the same genre or on the same subject.    In pursuing the goal of achieving a  balanced collection that serves the needs and interests of their patrons,  librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guided by a  library's collection development policy. These collection development policies  are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries' governing boards and with  representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings,  discussions and other input.    Although many librarians use  selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the  quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate their  selection decisions to parties outside of the public library or its governing  body. One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans  to acquire print and video resources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors  provide materials based on the library's description of its collection  development criteria. The vendor sends materials to the library, and the library  retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the  materials that do not. Even in this arrangement, however, the librarians still  retain ultimate control over their collection development and review all of the  materials that enter their library's collection.                      The Internet in Public        Libraries    The vast majority of public libraries  offer Internet access to their patrons.  According to a recent report by the U.S. National Commission on  Libraries and Information Science, approximately 95% of all public libraries  provide public access to the Internet. John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure,   Public Libraries and the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data  Tables , Report to National Commission on Libraries and Information Science,  at 3 .  The Internet vastly expands the amount of  information available to patrons of public libraries. The widespread  availability of Internet access in public libraries is due, in part, to the  availability of public funding, including state and local funding and the  federal funding programs regulated by CIPA.   Many libraries face a large amount of  patron demand for their Internet services.  At some libraries, patron demand for Internet  access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access  to the Internet. These libraries use sign-in and time limit procedures and/or  establish rules regarding the allowable uses of the terminals, in an effort to  ration their computer resources.  For example, some of the libraries whose librarians testified at  trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internet  terminals.    Public libraries play an important  role in providing Internet access to citizens who would not otherwise possess  it.  Of the 143 million  Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access  the Internet at a public library.  Internet access at  public libraries is more often used by those with lower incomes than those with  higher incomes. About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of  less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet  access.   Approximately 70% of libraries serving  communities with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.                                 Internet Use          Policies in Public Libraries     Approximately 95% of libraries with  public Internet access have some form of ""acceptable use"" policy or ""Internet  use"" policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. These policies set forth the  conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and use the library's  Internet resources.  These  policies vary widely. Some of the less restrictive policies, like those held by  Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver Regional Library, do not prohibit  adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials on the Web, as long as  they do so at terminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, which are  designed to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are  viewing, and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so. Other  libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing all ""sexually explicit"" or  ""sexually graphic"" materials.    Some libraries prohibit the viewing  of materials that are not necessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are  ""harmful to minors,"" ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" ""racially  offensive,"" or simply ""inappropriate.""   Other libraries  restrict access to Web sites that the library just does not want to provide,  even though the sites are not necessarily offensive. For example, the Fulton  County Public Library restricts access to the Web sites of dating services.  Similarly, the Tacoma Public Library's policy does not allow patrons to use the  library's Internet terminals for personal email, for online chat, or for playing  games.    In some cases, libraries instituted  Internet use policies after having experienced specific problems, whereas in  other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policies and regulatory  measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering public Internet  access. Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet use  policies and to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use  of the Internet.    First, libraries have sought to  protect patrons (especially children) and staff members from accidentally  viewing sexually explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed  harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. For example, some  librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually  explicit images minimized on an Internet terminal so that the next patron would  see them when they began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit  images from a Web site and left them at a public printer.    Second, libraries have attempted to  protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they  do not wish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, the  Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet use policy states  that the library ""employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility that  customers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full  nudity and sexual acts.""    Third, libraries have sought to keep  patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually  explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate. For  example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library's Internet use logs for the year  2000 showed that  users  between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filter blocks that  occurred on library computers. The study, which we credit, concluded that  children and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit  images in the library.  The  Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patrons  were accessing obscene materials in the public library in violation of South  Carolina's obscenity statute.    Finally, some libraries have  regulated patrons' Internet use to attempt to control patrons' inappropriate (or  illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages that contain  sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable.     We recognize the concerns that led  several of the public libraries whose librarians and board members testified in  this case to start using Internet filtering software. The testimony of the  Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative.   In December 1999, there was  considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons who  routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. In response to  public outcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a  special board meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public  concerning the library's provision of Internet access.  At this meeting, the Board learned for the first time of complaints  about children being exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library's  Internet terminals.    In late January to early February of  2000, the library installed privacy screens and recessed terminals in an effort  to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the  library.   In February, 2000, the Board informed the  library staff that they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolina  obscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition on access to obscene  materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicable  local, state, and federal laws. Staff were told that they were to enforce the  policy by means of a ""tap on the shoulder.""   Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy, the Board adopted  an ""Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy."" Under the policy, the Board  temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reduced  substantially the number of computers with Internet access in the library;  reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact  with all Internet-accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from  terminals with Internet access.    Even after the Board implemented the  privacy screens and later the ""tap-on-the-shoulder"" policy combined with placing  terminals in view of librarians, the  library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians  who worked in view of Internet terminals.  Finding that the policies that it had tried did not prevent the  viewing of sexually explicit materials in the library,  the Board at one point considered  discontinuing Internet access in the library.  The Board finally concluded that the methods  that it had used to regulate Internet use were not sufficient to stem the  behavioral problems that it thought were linked to the availability of  pornographic materials in the library. As a result, it implemented a mandatory  filtering policy.    We note, however, that none of the  libraries proffered by the defendants presented any systematic records or  quantitative comparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriate  behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using Internet  filtering software compared to the amount that happened after they installed the  software. The plaintiffs' witnesses also testified that  because public libraries are public places,  incidents involving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual and otherwise)  existed long before libraries provided access to the Internet.                                Methods for          Regulating Internet Use     The methods that public libraries use  to regulate Internet use vary greatly. They can be organized into four  categories: (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patrons so that  they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminals  in public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are  complying with the library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet  filtering software.    The first category - channeling  patrons' Internet use - frequently includes offering training to patrons on how  to use the Internet, including how to access the information that they want and  to avoid the materials that they do not want. Another technique that some public  libraries use to direct their patrons to pages that the libraries have  determined to be accurate and valuable is to establish links to ""recommended Web  sites"" from the public library's home page (i.e., the page that appears when  patrons begin a session at one of the library's public Internet terminals).  Librarians select these recommended Web sites by using criteria similar to those  employed in traditional collection development. However, unless the library  determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does not preclude  patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites.    Libraries may extend the ""recommended  Web sites"" method further by limiting patrons' access to only those Web sites  that are reviewed and selected by the library's staff. For example, in 1996, the  Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to children through a service  called the ""Library Channel."" This service was intended to be a means by which  the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation to  patrons. Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children's section of  the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians.  After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because  it overly constrained the children's ability to access materials on the  Internet, and because the library experienced several technical problems with  the system.   Public libraries also use several  different techniques to separate patrons during Internet sessions so that they  will not see what other patrons are viewing. The simplest way to achieve this  result is to position the library's public Internet terminals so that they are  located away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals),  for example, by placing them so that they face a wall. This method is obviously  constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout. Some libraries  have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals. These  screens make a monitor appear blank unless the viewer is looking at it  head-on. (5)   Although the Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submitted records showing  that they have received few complaints regarding patrons' unwilling exposure to  materials on the Internet, privacy screens do not always prevent library patrons  or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that another patron is  viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. They also have the drawback of  making it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal, or for  librarians to assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two  people to stand side by side and view a screen at the same time. Some library  patrons also find privacy screens to be a hindrance and have attempted to remove  them in order to improve the brightness of the screen or to make the view  better.    Another method that libraries use to  prevent patrons from seeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is  the installation of ""recessed monitors."" Recessed monitors are computer screens  that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewed from above. Although  recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens, eliminate  almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contents on  another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens,  that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian  at a single terminal. Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are  costly, but did not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens  or filtering software. A related technique that some public libraries use is to  create a separate children's Internet viewing area, where no adults except those  accompanying children in their care may use the Internet terminals. This serves  the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewing materials  appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals.     A third set of techniques that public  libraries have used to enforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite  tack from the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the  library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, such as  near the library's reference desk. This approach allows librarians to enforce  their library's Internet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and  employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patrons are  viewing materials that are inconsistent with the library's policies, a library  staff member approaches them and asks them to view something else, or may ask  them to end their Internet session. A patron who does not comply with these  requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permitted under the library's  Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privileges  suspended or revoked. But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching  patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation  unpleasant. Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder  policy.    The fourth category of methods that  public libraries employ to enforce their Internet use policies, and the one that  gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software. According to  the June 2000  Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries ,  approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use  of blocking programs by adult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons  with the option of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether  to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet. Other  public libraries require their child patrons to use filtering software, but not  their adult patrons.    Filtering software vendors sell their  products on a subscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with the  number of computers on which the filtering software will be used. In 2001, the  cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1,950 for 100 terminal  licenses. The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2  filtering software, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville  Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.    No evidence was presented on the cost  of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the-shoulder policy,  relative to the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of the libraries  proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative  effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being  unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit material, and the use of filters,  discussed below. No evidence was presented, for example, comparing the number of  patron complaints in those libraries that have tried both  methods.   The librarians who testified at trial  whose libraries use Internet filtering software all provide methods by which  their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites or pages. Of  these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URL be  unblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons  to request a URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron  is using that does not contain a return email address for the user. David Biek,  the head librarian at the Tacoma Library's main branch, testified at trial that  the library keeps records that would enable it to know which patrons made  unblocking requests, but does not use that information to connect users with  their requests. Biek also testified that he periodically scans the library's  Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked, so that  he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but were not, in  order to add them to a blocked category list. In the course of scanning the use  logs, Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography.  In two cases, he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over  the logs in response to a subpoena.    At all events, it takes time for  librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons' requests to unblock  Web pages. In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions  sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover, none of these libraries  allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the  validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs. A few of the  defendants' proffered libraries represented that individual librarians would  have the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internet access on a staff  computer upon request, but none claimed that allowing such access was mandatory,  and patron access is supervised in every instance. None of these libraries makes  differential unblocking decisions based on the patrons' age. Unblocking  decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors. Unblocking  decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web site for  minors.    It is apparent that many patrons are  reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that  contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if  they are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit the testimony of  Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a young  teen to ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view  materials concerning gay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of  Mark Brown, who stated that he would have been too embarrassed to ask a  librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded his ability to  research treatments and cosmetic surgery options for his mother when she was  diagnosed with breast cancer.    The pattern of patron requests to  unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involved in this case also  confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking  requests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously. For example,   the Fulton County Library  receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public  Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, and the  Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests since  1999.  In light of the fact  that a substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very libraries,   see infra  Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking  requests in these libraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters,  but rather reflects patrons' reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.               Internet Filtering      Technology                       What Is Filtering        Software, Who Makes It, and What Does It Do?       Commercially available products that  can be configured to block or filter access to certain material on the Internet  are among the ""technology protection measures"" that may be used to attempt to  comply with CIPA. There are numerous filtering software products available  commercially. Three network-based filtering products - SurfControl's Cyber  Patrol, N2H2's Bess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter - currently have  the lion's share of the public library market.  The parties in this case deposed  representatives from these three companies.  Websense, another network-based blocking  product, is also currently used in the public library market, and was discussed  at trial.    Filtering software may be installed  either on an individual computer or on a computer network.  Network-based filtering software products are  designed for use on a network of computers and funnel requests for Internet  content through a centralized network device. Of the various commercially  available blocking products, network-based products are the ones generally  marketed to institutions, such as public libraries, that provide Internet access  through multiple terminals.    Filtering programs function in a  fairly simple way. When an Internet user requests access to a certain Web site  or page, either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Web browser, or  by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks that domain name or IP  address against a previously compiled ""control list"" that may contain up to  hundreds of thousands of URLs. The three companies deposed in this case have  control lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These lists determine  which URLs will be blocked.    Filtering software companies divide  their control lists   into multiple categories for which they have  created unique definitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses 35  categories (and seven ""exception"" categories), Websense uses 30 categories, and  Secure Computing uses 30 categories.  Filtering software customers choose which categories of URLs they  wish to enable. A user ""enables"" a category in a filtering  program   by configuring the program to block all of the  Web pages listed in that category.    The following is a list of the  categories offered by each of these four filtering programs.  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers the  following categories: Adult/Sexually Explicit; Advertisements; Arts &  Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet; Criminal Skills; Drugs, Alcohol  & Tobacco; Education; Finance & Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling;  Games; Glamour & Intimate Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate  Speech; Health & Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job  Search & Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor  Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating; Photo Searches; Real Estate; Reference;  Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education; Search Engines; Shopping; Sports;  Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News; Violence; Weapons; and Web-based Email.     N2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol; Auction;  Chat; Drugs; Electronic Commerce; Employment Search; Free Mail; Free Pages;  Gambling; Games; Hate/Discrimination; Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin  Boards; Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals;  Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating Information;  Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex; Sports; Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross;  Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Nudity"" category purports to block only  ""non-pornographic"" images. The ""Sex"" category is intended to block only those  depictions of sexual activity that are not intended to arouse. The  ""Tasteless/Gross"" category includes contents such as ""tasteless humor"" and  ""graphic medical or accident scene photos.""   Additionally, N2H2 offers seven ""exception categories."" These  exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine, For Kids,  History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exception category is  enabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associated with both a  category and an exception, for example, both ""Sex"" and ""Education,"" will be  allowed, even if the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the  category ""Sex.""    As of November 15, 2001, of  those Web sites categorized by N2H2 as ""Sex,"" 3.6% were also categorized as  ""Education,"" 2.9% as ""Medical,"" and 1.6% as ""History.""    Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy; Advocacy  Groups; Adult Material; Business & Economy; Drugs; Education; Entertainment;  Gambling; Games; Government; Health; Illegal/Questionable; Information  Technology; Internet Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News &  Media; Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate; Religion;  Shopping; Society & Lifestyle; Special Events; Sports; Tasteless; Travel;  Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Adult"" category includes ""full or partial  nudity of individuals,"" as well as sites offering ""light adult humor and  literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Sexuality/Pornography""  category includes,  inter alia , ""hard-core adult humor and literature""  and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Tasteless"" category includes  ""hard-to-stomach sites, including offensive, worthless or useless sites,  grotesque or lurid depictions of bodily harm."" The ""Hacking"" category blocks  ""sites providing information on or promoting illegal or questionable access to  or use of communications equipment and/or software.""    SmartFilter offers the following categories: Anonymizers/Translators;  Art & Culture; Chat; Criminal Skills; Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs;  Entertainment; Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate  Speech; Humor; Investing; Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3 Sites; Nudity;  On-line Sales; Personal Pages; Politics, Opinion & Religion; Portal Sites;  Self-Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel; Usenet News; and Webmail.    Most importantly, no category  definition used by filtering software companies is identical to CIPA's  definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful  to minors. And category definitions and categorization decisions are made  without reference to local community standards. Moreover, there is no judicial  involvement in the creation of filtering software companies' category  definitions and no judicial determination is made before these companies  categorize a Web page or site.    Each filtering software company  associates each URL in its control list with a ""tag"" or other identifier that  indicates the company's evaluation of whether the content or features of the Web  site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its category  definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site or page that is blocked by  the filter, the user is immediately presented with a screen that indicates that  a block has occurred as a result of the operation of the filtering software.  These ""denial screens"" appear only at the point that a user attempts to access a  site or page in an enabled category.    All four of the filtering programs on  which evidence was presented allow users to customize the category lists that  exist on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specific URLs. For  example, if a public librarian charged with administering a library's Internet  terminals comes across a Web site that he or she finds objectionable that is not  blocked by the filtering program that his or her library is using, then the  librarian may add that URL to a category list that exists only on the library's  network, and it would thereafter be blocked under that category. Similarly, a  customer may remove individual URLs from category lists. Importantly, however,  no one but the filtering companies has access to the complete list of URLs in  any category.  The actual URLs  or IP addresses of the Web sites or pages contained in filtering software  vendors' category lists are considered to be proprietary information, and are  unavailable for review by customers or the general public, including   the proprietors of Web sites  that are blocked by filtering software . (6)     Filtering software companies do not  generally notify the proprietors of Web sites when they block their sites. The  only way to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blocked by any  particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs with filtering  software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" that most  filtering software companies provide on their Web sites. Filtering software  companies will entertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web  sites that discover their sites are blocked. Because new pages are constantly  being added to the Web, filtering companies provide their customers with  periodic updates of category lists. Once a particular Web page or site is  categorized, however, filtering companies generally do not re-review the  contents of that page or site unless they receive a request to do so, even  though the content on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently.                       The Methods that        Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists          While the way in which filtering  programs operate is conceptually straightforward - by comparing a requested URL  to a previously compiled list of URLs and blocking access to the content at that  URL if it appears on the list - accurately compiling and categorizing URLs to  form the category lists is a more complex process that is impossible to conduct  with any high degree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering software  companies use to compile and categorize control lists are, like the lists  themselves, proprietary information. We will therefore set forth only general  information on the various types of methods that all filtering companies deposed  in this case use, and the sources of error that are at once inherent in those  methods and unavoidable given the current architecture of the Internet and the  current state of the art in automated classification systems. We base our  understanding of these methods largely on the detailed testimony and expert  report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffs offered, and the  Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on automated classification  systems. (7)     When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category  lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases. First, they  must collect or ""harvest"" the relevant URLs from the vast number of sites that  exist on the Web. Second, they must sort through the URLs they have collected to  determine under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any), they  should be classified. These tasks necessarily result in a tradeoff between  overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category  definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and  underblocking (i.e., leaving off of a control list a URL that contains content  that would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering  software companies).                                The ""Harvesting""          Phase     Filtering  software companies, given their limited resources, do not attempt to index or  classify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web. Instead, the set of  pages that they attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion  of the Web. The companies use a variety of automated and manual methods to  identify a universe of Web sites and pages to ""harvest"" for classification.  These methods include: entering certain key words into search engines; following  links from a variety of online directories (e.g., generalized directories like  Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those that provide links to  sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of newly-registered domain names;  buying or licensing lists of URLs from third parties; ""mining"" access logs  maintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers  and the public.  The goal of  each of these methods is to identify as many URLs as possible that are likely to  contain content that falls within the filtering companies' category definitions.     The first method, entering certain  keywords into commercial search engines, suffers from several limitations.  First, the Web pages that may be ""harvested"" through this method are limited to  those pages that search engines have already identified. However, as noted  above, a substantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable  (because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only  approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually  been indexed by search engines. We are satisfied that the remainder of the  indexable Web, and the vast ""Deep Web,"" which cannot currently be indexed,  includes materials that meet CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are  obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors. These portions of the Web  cannot presently be harvested through the methods that filtering software  companies use (except through reporting by customers or by observing users' log  files), because they are not linked to other known pages. A user can, however,  gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site's  proprietor or some other third party informs the user of the site's URL. Some  Web sites, for example, send out mass email advertisements containing the site's  URL, the spamming process we have described above.    Second, the search engines that  software companies use for harvesting are able to search text only, not images.   This is of critical  importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only ""visual depictions."" 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition  technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in  the near future. None of the filtering software companies deposed in this case  employs image recognition technology when harvesting or categorizing URLs. Due  to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of image recognition  technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be  harvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that  Web site publishers may use image files rather than text to represent words,  i.e., they may use a file that computers understand to be a picture, like a  photograph of a printed word, rather than regular text, making automated review  of their textual content impossible. For example, if the Playboy Web site  displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a search engine would  not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo.    In addition to collecting URLs  through search engines and Web directories (particularly those specializing in  sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of the filtering  companies' category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLs  submitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs  by using ""spidering"" software that can ""crawl"" the lists of pages produced by  the previous four methods, following their links downward to bring back the  pages to which they link (and the pages to which those pages link, and so on,  but usually down only a few levels). This spidering software uses the same type  of technology that commercial Web search engines use.    While useful in expanding the number  of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additional pages through this approach  is limited by the architectural feature of the Web that page-to-page links tend  to converge rather than diverge. That means that the more pages from which one  spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sites one will  uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engine  or Web directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an  additional 1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct  sites, and the proportion of new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as  more pages are spidered.    These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for  review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with  respect to both the category definitions employed by filtering software  companies and CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child  pornography, or harmful to minors.                                The ""Winnowing"" or          Categorization Phase     Once the URLs have been harvested, some  filtering software companies use automated key word analysis tools to evaluate  the content and/or features of Web sites or pages accessed via a particular URL  and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them. This process may be  characterized as ""winnowing"" the harvested URLs.   Automated systems currently used by filtering software vendors to  prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively categorize the content and/or  features of a Web site or page accessed via a particular URL operate by means of  (1) simple key word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithms that  rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic features in a Web  page's text. The automated systems used to categorize pages do not include image  recognition technology.  All  of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ human review of some  or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web  pages. As with the harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing  process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and  underblocking.    First, simple key-word-based filters  are subject to the obvious limitation that no string of words can identify all  sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most strings of words are  likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containing  sexually explicit content. As noted above, filtering software companies also use  more sophisticated automated classification systems for the statistical  classification of texts. These systems assign weights to words or other textual  features and use algorithms to determine whether a text belongs to a certain  category. These algorithms sometimes make reference to the position of a word  within a text or its relative proximity to other words. The weights are usually  determined by machine learning methods (often described as ""artificial  intelligence""). In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial  and error, a system is given a ""training set"" consisting of documents  preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might  be potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then ""learns"" rules  that assign weights to those features according to how well they work in  classification, and assigns each new document to a category with a certain  probability.    Notwithstanding their ""artificial  intelligence"" description, automated text classification systems are unable to  grasp many distinctions between types of content that would be obvious to a  human. And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make  the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal  definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.     Finally, all the filtering software  companies deposed in this case use some form of human review in their process of  winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to  categorizing some Web pages without any human review .  SmartFilter states that ""the final categorization of every Web site  is done by a human reviewer."" Another filtering company asserts that of the  10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the ""work queue"" to be categorized each  day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their  PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classified in the pornography  category), and the remainder are categorized by human review. SurfControl also  states that no URL is ever added to its database without human review.     Human review of Web pages has the  advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than  automated classification systems are capable of making, but suffers from its own  sources of error.  The  filtering software companies involved here have limited staff, of between eight  and a few dozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages. The reviewers  that are employed by these companies base their categorization decisions on both  the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sites or pages they are  assigned to review. Human reviewers generally focus on English language Web  sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.    Given the speed at which human  reviewers must work to keep up with even a fraction of the approximately 1.5  million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error is  inevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness,  overzealousness, or a desire to ""err on the side of caution"" by screening out  material that might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit  within any of the company's category definitions. None of the filtering  companies trains its reviewers in the legal definitions concerning what is  obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and none instructs reviewers  to take community standards into account when making categorization decisions.     Perhaps because of limitations on the  number of human reviewers and because of the large number of new pages that are  added to the Web every day, filtering companies also widely engage in the  practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the ""root URL,"" rather than  engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web  site. For example, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all  categorize the entire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or  Pornography. They do not differentiate between pages within the site containing  sexually explicit images or text, and for example, pages containing no sexually  explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians.  If the ""root"" or ""top-level"" URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then  access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category  is enabled by a customer.    In some cases, whole Web sites are  blocked because the filtering companies focus only on the content of the home  page that is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Web sites containing  multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human review of each  individual page on that site. Web sites that may contain multiple Web pages and  that require authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized based  solely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to  reaching the authentication or payment page.    Because there may be hundreds or  thousands of pages under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary  mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need  arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking is called ""inheritance,""  because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL without  regard to their specific content. In some cases, ""reverse inheritance"" also  occurs, i.e., parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level  of the site. This might happen when pages with sexual content appear in a Web  site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess  filtering product classifies every page in the Salon.com Web site, which  contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as ""Sex, Profanity,""  based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals with sexual  issues.   Blocking by both domain name and IP  address is another practice in which filtering companies engage that is a  function both of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies of dealing  with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages.  The category lists maintained by filtering  software companies can include URLs in either their human-readable domain name  address form, their numeric IP address form, or both.  Through ""virtual hosting"" services, hundreds  of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain names may share a single numeric  IP address. To the extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses of  virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substantial amount of  content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of  content.    Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with  a structural feature of the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of  so-called ""loophole"" Web sites. These are Web sites that provide access to a  particular Web page, but display in the user's browser a URL that is different  from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated. Because of  this feature, they provide a ""loophole"" that can be used to get around filtering  software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appears  on the filtering company's control list. ""Loophole"" Web sites include caches of  Web pages that have been removed from their original location, ""anonymizer""  sites, and translation sites.    Caches are archived copies that some  search engines, such as Google, keep of the Web pages they index. The cached  copy stored by Google will have a URL that is different from the original URL.  Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages  that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs for some reason.  For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL, and  replace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to find an article  published six months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for  Google's cached version.    Some sites on the Web serve as a  proxy or intermediary between a user and another Web page. When using a proxy  server, a user does not access the page from its original URL, but rather from  the URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an ""anonymizer."" Users  may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do not want the Web  site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they  are accessing the site, or to leave ""cookies"" on their browser. (8)   Some proxy servers can be used to attempt to translate Web page content from one  language to another. Rather than directly accessing the original Web page in its  original language, users can instead indirectly access the page via a proxy  server offering translation features.    As noted above, filtering companies  often block loophole sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites.  The practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily results in a significant  amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of the pages that are cached,  for example, do not contain content that would match a filtering company's  category definitions. Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however,  may enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site, thus  resulting in substantial underblocking.                                The Process for          ""Re-Reviewing"" Web Pages After Their Initial          Categorization     Most filtering software companies do not engage in subsequent reviews  of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis. Priority is placed on  reviewing and categorizing new sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing  already categorized sites and pages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's  previous categorization of a Web site is not re-reviewed for accuracy when new  pages are added to the Web site. To the extent the Web site was previously  categorized as a whole, the new pages added to the site usually share the  categorization assigned by the blocking product vendor.  This necessarily results in both over- and  underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Web pages and Web sites  changes relatively rapidly.    In addition to the content on Web  sites or pages changing rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be  replaced by sites with entirely different content. If an IP address associated  with a particular Web site is blocked under a particular category and the Web  site goes out of existence, then the IP address likely would be reassigned to a  different Web site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration  organization, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers,  see   http://www.arin.net,/ . In that case,  the site that received the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized.  Because filtering companies do not engage in systematic re-review of their  category lists, such a site would likely remain miscategorized unless someone  submitted it to the filtering company for re-review, increasing the incidence of  over- and underblocking.    This failure to re-review Web pages  primarily increases a filtering company's rate of overblocking. However, if a  filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it determines that they do  not fall into any of its blocking categories, then that would result in  underblocking (because, for example, a page might add sexually explicit  content).                      The Inherent Tradeoff        Between Overblocking and Underblocking    There is an inherent tradeoff between  any filter's rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call  ""precision"") and its rate of underblocking (which is also referred to as  ""recall""). The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportion  of the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are  appropriately classified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the  hypothetical example of a classification system that is asked to pick out  pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of  which 80 were actually dogs. If it returned 100 hits, of which 80 were in fact  pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer,  we would say that the system identified dog pictures with a precision of 80%.  This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%.     The recall measure involves  determining what proportion of the actual members of a category the  classification system has been able to identify. For example, if the  hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs,  and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it would have  performed with a recall of 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that  underblocked 60% of the material in a category.    In automated classification systems, there is  always a tradeoff between precision and recall. In the animal-picture example,  the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the  dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs  would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a  resulting loss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates of  overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated  classification systems. For example, an automated system that classifies any Web  page that contains the word ""sex"" as sexually explicit will underblock much  less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page  containing the phrase ""free pictures of people having sex"" as sexually  explicit.   This tradeoff between overblocking  and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but  also to filters that use only human review. Given the approximately two billion  pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages that are added daily, and  the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company  blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be  impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking.  Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level,  domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but  necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above.     To use a simple example, it would be  easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that  completely avoids overblocking. Such a filter would have only a single sexually  explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed daily to  ensure that its content does not change. While there would be no overblocking  problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking  problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web  other than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it would also be easy to  design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely  avoids underblocking. Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view  only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would be  no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking  problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on  the Web other than the Sesame Street site.    While it is thus quite simple to  design a filter that does not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter  that does not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size,  rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art  of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither  underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech. The more effective a  filter is at blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will  necessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effective in preventing  users from accessing sexually explicit content on the Web will necessarily block  substantial  amounts of  non-sexually explicit speech.                      Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over- and        Underblocking    The government presented three studies, two from expert witnesses,  and one from a librarian fact witness who conducted a study using Internet use  logs from his own library, that attempt to quantify the over- and underblocking  rates of five different filtering programs. The plaintiffs presented one expert  witness who attempted to quantify the rates of over- and underblocking for  various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify rates of over- and  underblocking suffers from various methodological flaws.    The fundamental problem with  calculating over- and underblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites  or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested. The studies that the parties  submitted in this case took two different approaches to this problem. Two of the  studies, one prepared by the plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, a graduate  student at the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the  defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in Research Triangle  Park, North Carolina, approached this problem by compiling two separate lists of  Web sites, one of URLs that they deemed should be blocked according to the  filters' criteria, and another of URLs that they deemed should not be blocked  according to the filters' criteria. They compiled these lists by choosing Web  sites from the results of certain key word searches. (9)   The problem with this selection method is that it is neither random, nor does it  necessarily approximate the universe of Web pages that library patrons visit.     The two other studies, one by David  Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library's main branch, and one by Cory  Finnell of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of  Web pages visited by library patrons during specific time periods as the  universe of Web pages to analyze. This method, while surely not as accurate as a  truly random sample of the indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible  to take such a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sites that  library patrons visited during a specific period. Because library patrons  selected the universe of Web sites that Biek and Finnell's studies analyzed,  this removes the possibility of bias resulting from the study author's selection  of the universe of sites to be reviewed. We find that the Lemmons and Hunter  studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to select  the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. We will therefore focus on the  studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimates of the  rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in  public libraries.    The government hired expert witness  Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiled by the public libraries systems  in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, South  Carolina.   Each of these libraries uses filtering  software that keeps a log of information about individual Web site requests made  by library patrons.  Finnell,  whose consulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience  evaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems. He spent more  than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that  work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering  products.    The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol  filtering software, and logs information only on sites that were blocked.  Finnell worked from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacoma public  library in the month of August 2001. The Westerville library uses the Websense  filtering product, and logs information on both blocked sites and non-blocked  sites. When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage  logs. Because of this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only  for the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001. The  Greenville library uses N2H2's filtering product and logs both blocked sites and  sites that patrons accessed. The logs contain more than 500,000 records per day.  Because of the volume of the records, Finnell restricted his analysis to the  period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001.    Finnell calculated an overblocking  rate for each of the three libraries by examining the host Web site containing  each of the blocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique, but instead  examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of a host Web site or the pages  within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product's definition of  the category under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an  accurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom were temporary employees,  examined the Web sites to determine whether they were consistent with the  filtering companies' category definitions. Their review was, of course,  necessarily limited by: (1) the clarity of the filtering companies' category  definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of the  definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability is also undercut by  the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed  either at the point that a patron in one of the three libraries was denied  access or when Finnell and his team reviewed the pages. It is therefore  impossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency of Finnell's review  team, or to know whether the pages contained the same content when the block  occurred as they did when Finnell's team reviewed them. This is a key flaw,  because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to  overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were required to  compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard  definitions provided by the filtering company.    Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol  software blocked 836 unique Web sites during the month of August. Finnell  determined that 783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 were inaccurate. (10)   The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be 6.34%, and the  true error rate was estimated with 95% confidence to lie within the range of  4.69% to 7.99%. (11)   Finnell and his team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked by  Westerville Library's Websense filter during the logged period and determined  that 158 of them were accurate and that 27 of them were inaccurate. He therefore  estimated the Websense filter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95%  confidence interval of 9.51% to 19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674  unique Web sites that were blocked by the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter  during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were accurate and that 87  were inaccurate. This yields an estimated overblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95%  confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%.   Finnell's methodology was materially  flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following  reasons. First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filters were  operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sites that  they perceived to be ""borderline"" sites, i.e., those that may or may not have  been appropriately filtered according to the filtering companies' category  definitions. Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs  offered screen shots of a number of Web sites that, according to Finnell, had  been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admitted contained only benign  materials. Finnell's explanation was that the Web sites must have changed  between the time when he conducted the study and the time of the trial, but  because he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed  them for the study, there is no way to verify this. Third, because of the way in  which Finnell counted blocked Web sites - i.e., if separate patrons attempted to  reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attempted to access more than  one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a single block,   see supra  note 10 - his results necessarily understate the number of  times that patrons were erroneously denied access to information.     At all events, there is no doubt that  Finnell's estimated rates of overblocking, which are based on the filtering  companies' own category definitions, significantly understate the rate of  overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions for filtering for  adults. The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries  were configured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually  explicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that these categories are far  broader than CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are obscene, or child  pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must  certify that they filter during adults' use of the Internet.    Finnell's study also calculated  underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries  (both of which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visited by  their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list of sites that  were not blocked. The study used a sample of 159 sites that were accessed by  Westerville patrons and determined that only one of them should have been  blocked under the software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking  rate of 0.6%. Given the size of the sample, the 95% confidence interval is 0% to  1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254 Web sites accessed by patrons in  Greenville and found that three of them should have been blocked under the  filtering software's category definitions. This results in an estimated  underblocking rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to  2.51%.    We do not credit Finnell's estimates  of the rates of underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries  for several reasons. First,  Finnell's estimates likely understate the actual rate of  underblocking because patrons, who knew that filtering programs were operating  in the Greenville and Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting  to access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents that they  knew would probably meet a filtering program's blocked categories. Second, and  most importantly, we think that the formula that Finnell used to calculate the  rate of underblocking in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula  that information scientists typically use to calculate a rate of  recall , which we describe  above in Subsection II.E.3. As Dr. Nunberg explained, the standard method that  information scientists use to calculate a rate of recall is to sort a set of  items into two groups, those that fall into a particular category (e.g., those  that should have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. The rate of  recall is then calculated by dividing the number of items that the system  correctly identified as belonging to the category by the total number of items  in the category.    In the example above, we discussed a  database that contained 1000 photographs. Assume that 200 of these photographs  were pictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification system designed to  identify pictures of dogs  identified 80 of the dog pictures and failed to identify 120, it  would have performed with a recall rate of 40%. This would be analogous to a  filter that underblocked at a rate of 60%.  To calculate the recall rate of the filters  in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in accordance with the  standard method described above, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites  from the libraries' Internet use logs (including both sites that were blocked  and sites that were not), and divided the number of sites in the sample that the  filter incorrectly failed to block by the total number of sites in the sample  that should have been blocked. What Finnell did instead was to take a sample of  sites that were not blocked, and divide the total number of sites in this sample  by the number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. This made  the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would have been had he  used the standard method for calculating recall, consequently making the  underblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have been under  the standard method. (12)   Moreover,  despite the relatively low rates of underblocking that Finnell's study found,  librarians from several of the libraries proffered by defendants that use  blocking products, including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that  there are instances of underblocking in their libraries.  No quantitative evidence was presented  comparing the effectiveness of filters and other alternative methods used by  libraries to prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene,  child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.    Biek undertook a similar study of the  overblocking rates that result from the Tacoma Library's use of the Cyber Patrol  software. He began with the 3,733 individual blocks that occurred in the Tacoma  Library in October 2000 and drew from this data set a random sample of 786 URLs.  He calculated two rates of overblocking, one with respect to the Tacoma  Library's policy on Internet use -  that the pictorial content of the site may not include ""graphic  materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously  and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes"" - and the other with  respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions.  He estimated that Cyber Patrol overblocked 4%  of all Web pages in October 2000 with respect to the definitions of the Tacoma  Library's Internet Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own  category definitions. (13)      It is difficult to determine how  reliable Biek's conclusions are, because he did not keep records of the raw data  that he used in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages as they  looked when he made the determination whether they were properly classified by  the Cyber Patrol program. Without this information, it is impossible to verify  his conclusions (or to undermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates  Cyber Patrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell's  study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries  that he studied.    We also note that Finnell's study,  which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the  same filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories  enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the Biek study  did. Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell  study estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, the category  definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect to adult use - visual  depictions that are obscene or child pornography - are narrower than the  materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek's study  understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's definitions for  adults.    In sum, we think that Finnell's  study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because  it states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking that occurred  when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operating in public  libraries. While these rates are substantial - between nearly 6% and 15% - we  think, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual  rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as  anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens  in all filtering programs.                      Methods of Obtaining        Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites     The plaintiffs assembled a list of  several thousand Web sites that they contend were, at the time of the study,  likely to have been erroneously blocked by one or more of four major commercial  filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2 Internet Filtering  2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They  compiled this list using a two-step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expert  witness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and  devised a program to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to  compile a list of URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more  of the programs. (14)   Second, Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled to librarians and  professors of library science whom the plaintiffs had hired to review the  blocked sites for suitability in the public library context.    Edelman assembled the list of URLs by  compiling Web pages that were blocked by the following categories in the four  programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2: Adults Only, Nudity,  Pornography, and Sex, with ""exceptions"" engaged in the categories of Education,  For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex,  Nudity, Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex.     Edelman then assembled a database of  Web sites for possible testing. He derived this list by automatically compiling  URLs from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories from the  Yahoo index that differed significantly from the classifications that he had  enabled in each of the blocking programs (taking, for example, Web sites from  Yahoo's ""Government"" category). He then expanded this list by entering URLs  taken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's ""related"" search  function, which provides the user with a list of similar sites. Edelman also  included and excluded specific Web sites at the request of the plaintiffs'  counsel.    Taking the list of more than  500,000   URLs that he had compiled, Edelman used an automated  system that he had developed to test whether particular URLs were blocked by  each of the four filtering programs. This testing took place between February  and October 2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particular sites were  blocked by particular programs, and, using commercial archiving software,  archived the contents of the home page of the blocked Web sites (and in some  instances the pages linked to from the home page) as it existed when it was  blocked. (15)   Through this process, Edelman, whose testimony we credit, compiled a list of  6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or more of the four programs. Because these  sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoo directory that were unrelated  to the filtering categories that were enabled during the test (i.e.,  ""Government"" vs. ""Nudity""), he reasoned that they were likely erroneously  blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and discovered  that Cyber Patrol had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he  had published the list on his Web site. His records indicate that an employee of  SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site  and presumably checked out the URLs on the list, thus confirming Edelman's  judgment that the majority of URLs on the list were erroneously blocked. (16)   Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph  Janes, an Assistant Professor in the Information School of the University of  Washington who also testified at trial as an expert witness. Janes reviewed the  sites that Edelman compiled to determine whether they are consistent with  library collection development, i.e., whether they are sites to which a  reference librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a  patron as a source of information. (17)      Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost  the entire list of blocked sites that he collected, from which Janes took a  random sample of 859 using the SPSS statistical software package. Janes  indicated that he chose a sample size of 859 because it would yield a 95%  confidence interval of plus or minus 2.5%. Janes recruited a group of 16  reviewers, most of whom were current or former students at the University of  Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites were  appropriate for library use. We describe the process that he used in the  margin. (18)   Due to the inability of a member of Janes's review team to complete the  reviewing process, Janes had to cut 157 Web sites out of the sample, but because  the Web sites were randomly assigned to reviewers, it is unlikely that these  sites differed significantly from the rest of the sample. That left the sample  size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence interval to plus or minus 2.8%.     Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that  165 of them, or 23.6% percent of the sample, were not of any value in the  library context (i.e., no librarian would, consistent with professional  standards, refer a patron to these sites as a source of information). They were  unable to find 60 of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore, they  concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the sample, were  examples of overblocking with respect to materials that are appropriate sources  of information in public libraries. Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus  or minus 2.8%, the study concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual  percentage of sites in the list of 6,775 sites that are appropriate for use in  public libraries is somewhere between 65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be  95% certain that the actual number of sites out of the 6,775 that Edelman  forwarded to Janes that are appropriate for use in public libraries (under  Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783.    The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's  methodology, attacking in particular the fact that,  while sites that received two ""yes"" votes in  the first round of voting were determined to be of sufficient interest in a  library context to be removed from further analysis, sites receiving one or two  ""no"" votes were sent to the next round. The government also correctly points out  that results of Janes's study can be generalized only to the population of 6,775  sites that Edelman forwarded to Janes.  Even taking these criticisms into account, and discounting Janes's  numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study as confirming that Edelman's set  of 6,775 Web sites contains at least a few thousand URLs that were erroneously  blocked by one or more of the four filtering programs that he used, whether  judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters' own category criteria, or  against the standard that the Janes study used. Edelman tested only 500,000  unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated  to exist in the indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that  were most likely to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we  conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman identified are  erroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs that he tested.     Edelman's and Janes's studies provide  numerous specific examples of Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or  more filtering programs. The Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or  more of the filtering programs do not fall into any neat patterns; they range  widely in subject matter, and it is difficult to tell why they may have been  overblocked. The list that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pages  relating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education,  travel, sports, and many other topics. In the next section, we provide examples  from each of these categories.                     Examples of        Erroneously Blocked Web Sites    Several of the erroneously blocked  Web sites had content relating to churches, religious orders, religious  charities, and religious fellowship organizations. These included the following  Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men's group  associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada,  http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828 ,   which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; the  Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas,  http://www.agapechurch.com , which was  blocked by Websense as ""Adult Content"" ; the home page of the Lesbian and  Gay Havurah of the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center,   http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm , which was blocked by N2H2 as  ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" and by Websense as ""Sex"";  Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage in Honduras that houses 225 children,   http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb_viva , which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the  ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category;  Vision Art Online, which sells wooden  wall hangings for the home that contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and  images of the Star of David,  http://www.visionartonline.com , which  was blocked in Websense's ""Sex"" category; and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a  Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to build a Buddhist  nunnery and international retreat center for women,   http://www.tenzinpalmo.com , which was categorized as ""Nudity"" by  N2H2.   Several blocked sites also contained  information about governmental entities or specific political candidates, or  contained political commentary. These included: the Web site for Kelley Ross, a  Libertarian candidate for the California State Assembly,  http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40 ,   which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; the Web site for Bob Coughlin, a town selectman  in Dedham, Massachusetts,  http://www.bobcoughlin.org , which was  blocked under N2H2's ""Nudity"" category;  a list of Web sites containing  information about government and politics in Adams County, Pennsylvania,  http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa ,  which was blocked  by Websense as ""Sex""; the Web site for Wisconsin Right  to Life,  http://www.wrtl.org , which N2H2  blocked as ""Nudity""; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda,   http://federo.com , which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography"";  ""Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,"" a Danish Web site dedicated to criticizing  the American system of capital punishment,  http://www.fdp.dk , which N2H2  blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Dumb Laws,"" a humor Web site that makes fun of  outmoded laws,  http://www.dumblaws.com , which N2H2 blocked under  its ""Sex"" category.    Erroneously blocked Web sites  relating to health issues included the following: a guide to allergies,  http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy ,   which was categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography"" by N2H2; a health question  and answer site sponsored by Columbia University,   http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu , which was blocked as ""Sex"" by  N2H2, and as ""Mature"" by Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home  Page,  http://www.usinter.net/wasa ,  which was blocked by N2H2 as  ""Pornography""; the Web site of the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport,  Louisiana cancer treatment facility,  http://cancerftr.wkmc.com , which was  blocked by Websense under the ""Sex"" category; and a site dealing with halitosis,   http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs , which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults,  Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually  Explicit,"" and by Websense as ""Adult Content.""    The  filtering programs also  erroneously blocked several Web sites having to do with education and careers.  The filtering programs blocked two sites that provide information on home  schooling. ""HomEduStation - the Internet Source for Home Education,""  http://www.perigree.net/~mcmullen/homedustation, ,  was categorized by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" Smartfilter  blocked ""Apricot: A Web site made by and for home schoolers,""  http://apricotpie.com ,  as ""Sex."" The  programs also miscategorized several career-related sites. ""Social Work Search,""   http://www.socialworksearch.com/ ,   is a directory for social workers that Cyber Patrol placed in its  ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The ""Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Southern  Nevada,""  http://www.lambdalv.com ,   "" a forum for the business  community to develop relationships within the Las Vegas lesbian, gay,  transsexual, and bisexual community"" was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults Only,  Pornography."" A site for aspiring dentists,  http://www.vvm.com/~bond/home.htm ,  was blocked by Cyber Patrol in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category.     The filtering programs erroneously  blocked many travel Web sites, including: the Web site for the Allen Farmhouse  Bed & Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina,   http://planet-nc.com/Beth/index.html , which Websense blocked as ""Adult  Content""; Odysseus Gay Travel, a travel company serving gay men,   http://www.odyusa.com , which N2H2 categorized as ""Adults Only,  Pornography""; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters,   http://albertaflyfish.com , which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and  ""Nature and Culture Conscious Travel,"" a tour operator in Namibia,   http://www.trans-namibia-tours.com , which was categorized as  ""Pornography"" by N2H2.    The filtering programs also  miscategorized a large number of sports Web sites. These included: a site  devoted to Willie O'Ree, the first African-American player in the National  Hockey League,  http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html , which Websense  blocked under its ""Nudity"" category; the home page of the Sydney University  Australian Football Club,  http://www.tek.com.au/suafc , which N2H2 blocked  as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" Smartfilter blocked as ""Sex,"" Cyber Patrol  blocked as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" and Websense blocked as ""Sex""; and a fan's  page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team,   http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com , which N2H2 blocked under the  ""Pornography"" category.                      Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering        Programs     Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with  problems created by the provision of Internet access. The large amount of  sexually explicit speech that is freely available on the Internet has, to  varying degrees, led to patron complaints about such matters as unsought  exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by  individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of  library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography. In some  libraries, youthful library patrons have persistently attempted to use the  Internet to access hardcore pornography.   Those public libraries that have  responded to these problems by using software filters have found such filters to  provide a relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing  sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entire  universe of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products'  category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial  amount of speech. Thus, software filters have not completely eliminated the  problems that public libraries have sought to address by using the filters, as  evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking. Nor is there any quantitative  evidence of the relative effectiveness of filters and the alternatives to  filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from accessing illegal content  on the Internet.    Even more importantly (for this  case), although software filters provide a relatively cheap and effective,  albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessing  speech that falls within the filters' category definitions, we find that  commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of  speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Any currently available  filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing users from  accessing content within the filter's category definitions will necessarily  block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of which does not match the  filtering company's category definitions, much less the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Even Finnell, an expert  witness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web  sites in the public libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that  meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicit content,  let alone CIPA's definitions.    This phenomenon occurs for a number  of reasons explicated in the more detailed findings of fact  supra .  These include limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvest Web  pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have  harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have  previously reviewed. The primary limitations on filtering companies' ability to  harvest Web pages for review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web  are not indexable using the spidering technology that Web search engines use,  and that together, search engines have indexed only around half of the Web pages  that are theoretically indexable. The fast rate of growth in the number of Web  pages also limits filtering companies' ability to harvest pages for review.  These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.     Several limitations on filtering  companies' ability to review and categorize the Web pages that they have  harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking. First, automated review  processes, even those based on ""artificial intelligence,"" are unable with any  consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category  definition from material that does not. Moreover, human review of URLs is  hampered by filtering companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or  misjudgment. In order to deal with the vast size of the Web and its rapid rates  of growth and change, filtering companies engage in several practices that are  necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably result in overblocking. These  include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority of their  pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering company's  categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column);  (2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many  different Web sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and  (3) blocking loophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which  archive Web pages that have been removed from the Web by their original  publisher.    Finally, filtering companies' failure  to engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have already categorized  (or that they have determined do not fall into any category) results in a  substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example, Web publishers  change the contents of Web pages frequently. The problem also arises when a Web  site goes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a  new Web site publisher. In that case, a filtering company's previous  categorization of the IP address or domain name would likely be incorrect,  potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages.     The inaccuracies that result from  these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial. At least tens  of thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by each of the  filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered  against the filtering companies' own category definitions. Many erroneously  blocked pages contain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and  minors, and that no rational person could conclude matches the filtering  companies' category definitions, such as ""pornography"" or ""sex.""   The number of overblocked sites is of  course much higher with respect to the definitions of obscenity and child  pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering products' category  definitions, such as ""sex"" and ""nudity,"" encompass vast amounts of Web pages  that are neither child pornography nor obscene. Thus, the number of pages of  constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the  many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering  products' category definitions.    No presently conceivable technology can make the judgments  necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Given the state of the art  in filtering and image recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and  expanding nature of the Web, we find that filtering products' shortcomings will  not be solved through a technical solution in the foreseeable future. (19)     In sum, filtering products are currently unable to block only  visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors (or,  only content matching a filtering product's category definitions) while  simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech (or, all content not  matching the blocking product's category definitions). Any software filter that  is reasonably effective in blocking access to Web pages that fall within its  category definitions will necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of  Web pages that do not fall within its category definitions.       Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of  Dole  and    the Role of the Facial Challenge     Both the plaintiffs and the government  agree that, because this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of  the conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receipt of federal funds,  the Supreme Court's decision in  South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203  (1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. The constitutional  source of Congress's spending power is Article I, § 8, cl. 1, which provides  that ""Congress shall have Power . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the  common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."" In  Dole , the  Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute requiring the  withholding of federal highway funds from any state with a drinking age below  21.  Id.  at 211-12. In sustaining the provision's constitutionality,   Dole  articulated four general constitutional limitations on Congress's  exercise of the spending power.   First, ""the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit  of 'the general welfare.'""  Id.  at 207. Second, any conditions that  Congress sets on states' receipt of federal funds must be sufficiently clear to  enable recipients ""to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the  consequences of their participation.""  Id.  (internal quotation marks and  citation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds must  bear some relation to the purpose of the funding program.  Id.  And  finally, ""other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the  conditional grant of federal funds.""  Id.  at 208. In particular, the  spending power ""may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities  that would themselves be unconstitutional. Thus, for example, a grant of federal  funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the infliction  of cruel and unusual punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the  Congress' broad spending power.""  Id.  at 210.   Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first  three limitations. However, they do allege that CIPA is unconstitutional under  the fourth prong of  Dole  because it will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment. (20)   Plaintiffs therefore submit that the First Amendment ""provide[s] an independent  bar to the conditional grant of federal funds"" created by CIPA.   Id.  at 208. More specifically, they argue that by conditioning  public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of software filters, CIPA  will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of Internet  content-providers to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library  patrons via the Internet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of public  library patrons to receive constitutionally protected speech on the Internet. (21)   The government concedes that under the  Dole  framework,  CIPA is facially invalid if its conditions will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment.  The government and the plaintiffs disagree,  however, on the meaning of  Dole 's ""inducement"" requirement in the  context of a First Amendment facial challenge to the conditions that Congress  places on state actors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends that  because plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must show that under no  circumstances is it possible for a public library to comply with CIPA's  conditions without violating the First Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that  even if it is possible for some public libraries to comply with CIPA without  violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it ""will result in  the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech.""     Because it was clear in  Dole  that the states could  comply with the challenged conditions that Congress attached to the receipt of  federal funds without violating the Constitution, the  Dole  Court did  not have occasion to explain fully what it means for Congress to use the  spending power to ""induce [recipients] to engage in activities that would  themselves be unconstitutional.""  Dole , 483 U.S. at 210;  see    id.  at 211 (""Were South Dakota to succumb to the blandishments offered  by Congress and raise its drinking age to 21, the State's action in so doing  would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.""). Although the  proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens' First  Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in the abstract, it is unclear  what exactly a litigant must establish to facially invalidate an exercise of  Congress's spending power on this ground.   In general, it is well-established that a court may sustain a  facial challenge to a statute only if the plaintiff demonstrates that the  statute admits of no constitutional application.  See   United States  v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (""A facial challenge to a legislative  Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the  challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the  Act would be valid."");  see also   Bowen v. Kendrick , 487 U.S.  589, 612 (1988) (""It has not been the Court's practice, in considering facial  challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that  particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."") (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted).   First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited  exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a statute that  burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, even if the statute may be  constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""The Constitution gives  significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First  Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is  unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected  expression.""  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399  (2002);  see also   Broadrick v. Oklahoma , 413 U.S. 601, 612  (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity under the First  Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a  number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's  sanctions may deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging  in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the  law. Without an overbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to  be hammered out case by case - and tested only by those hardy enough to risk  criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation.""   Dombrowski v. Pfister , 380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965);  see also    Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc. , 472 U.S. 491, 503 (1985) (""[A]n  individual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or  sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also  threatens others not before the court - those who desire to engage in legally  protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk  prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially  invalid."").   Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable  here, since CIPA ""threatens to chill free speech - because it will censor a  substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law  creates a prior restraint . . . ."" Unlike the statutes typically challenged as  facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those  who violate its conditions.   Cf.   Freedom of Speech  Coalition , 122 S. Ct. at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few  legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other speakers in any  capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this  law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be  constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as  this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power,  than in challenges to criminal statutes.    Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected  speech,""  id. , and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its face,  public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's  terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amounts of constitutionally  protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and  consequently losing the benefits of federal funds.  See  47 C.F.R. §  54.520(e)(1) (""A school or library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of  computers in accordance with the certifications required by this section, must  reimburse any funds and discounts received under the federal universal support  service support mechanism for schools and libraries for the period in which  there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to  comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Court has  sustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power.   See, e.g. ,  Legal Servs.  Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on its  face a federal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who  receive federal funds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment).     The Court's unconstitutional conditions  cases, such as  Velazquez , are not strictly controlling, since they do  not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to  federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights, as  is the case under the fourth prong of  Dole . However, they are highly  instructive.   The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions  cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment  facial challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a  seamless web. For example, in  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991),  the Court rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to federal regulations  prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from providing counseling  concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining  that:   Petitioners are challenging the   facial  validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with  the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the  Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of  individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights.  Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated  as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact that the regulations might operate  unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient  to render them wholly invalid.   Id.  at 183 (internal quotation  marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast,  NEA v. Finley ,  524 U.S. 569 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to  an exercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal  test of facial validity than  Rust , explaining that ""[t]o prevail,  respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk that application of the  provision will lead to the suppression of speech.""  Id.  at  580.   Against this background, it is unclear  to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it  will ""induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be  unconstitutional,""  Dole , 483 U.S. at 210, plaintiffs must show that it  is impossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without  violating the First Amendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively  restrict library patrons' access to substantial amounts of constitutionally  protected speech, therefore causing many libraries to violate the First  Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue. Rather, we may assume  without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge to CIPA  requires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's  conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in  detail below, we believe that CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this  more restrictive test of facial validity urged on us by the government. Because  of the inherent limitations in filtering technology, public libraries can never  comply with CIPA without blocking access to a substantial amount of speech that  is both constitutionally protected and fails to meet even the filtering  companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legal  principles to be applied to the facts in order to determine whether the First  Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by  CIPA.       Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet    Access in Public Libraries     In analyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use of Internet  filtering software, we must first identify the appropriate level of scrutiny to  apply to this restriction on patrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue  that a public library's use of such filters is subject to strict scrutiny, the  government maintains that the applicable standard is rational basis review. If  strict scrutiny applies, the government must show that the challenged  restriction on speech is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government  interest and that no less restrictive alternative would further that interest.   United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).  In contrast, under rational basis review, the challenged restriction need only  be reasonable; the government interest that the restriction serves need not be  compelling; the restriction need not be narrowly tailored to serve that  interest; and the restriction ""need not be the most reasonable or the only  reasonable limitation.""  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund ,  473 U.S. 788, 808 (1985).   Software filters, by definition, block  access to speech on the basis of its content, and content-based restrictions on  speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny.  See   Playboy ,  529 U.S. at 813 (""[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if  it satisfies strict scrutiny.""). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply to  content-based restrictions on speech, however, where the restrictions apply only  to speech on government property, such as public libraries. ""[I]t is . . . well  settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that  it owns and controls.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.  Lee , 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to a discussion of public  forum doctrine.             Overview of Public Forum Doctrine     The government's power to restrict speech on its own property is not  unlimited. Rather, under public forum doctrine, the extent to which the First  Amendment permits the government to restrict speech on its own property depends  on the character of the forum that the government has created.  See    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc. , 473 U.S. 788  (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions on  speech in those areas considered less amenable to free expression, such as  military bases,  see   Greer v. Spock , 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail  grounds,  see   Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 (1966), or  public airport terminals,  see   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee , 505 U.S. 672 (1992), than to restrictions on  speech in state universities,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector &  Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819 (1995), or streets, sidewalks and  public parks,  see   Frisby v. Schultz , 487 U.S. 474 (1988);   Hague v. CIO , 307 U.S. 496 (1939).   The Supreme Court has identified three  types of fora for purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny  applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government property:  traditional public fora, designated public fora, and nonpublic fora. Traditional  public fora include sidewalks, squares, and public parks:   [S]treets and parks . . . have  immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind,  have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between  citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public  places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities,  rights, and liberties of citizens.   Hague , 307 U.S. at 515. ""In  these quintessential public forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a  content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a  compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983);   see also   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness , 505 U.S. at  678 (""[R]egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been  available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny."");   Frisby , 487 U.S. at 480 (""[W]e have repeatedly referred to public  streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum."").   A second category of fora, known as  designated (or limited) public fora, ""consists of public property which the  State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity.""   Perry , 460 U.S. at 46. Whereas any content-based restriction on the use  of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally  permitted, as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to  limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain  subjects.  See   Perry , 460 U.S. at 45 n.7. Once it has defined  the limits of a designated public forum, however, ""[r]egulation of such property  is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public  forum.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness , 505 U.S. at 678.  Examples of designated fora include university meeting facilities,  see    Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981), school board meetings,   see   City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment  Relations Comm'n , 429 U.S. 167 (1976), and municipal theaters,  see    Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad , 420 U.S. 546  (1975).   The third category, nonpublic fora,  consists of all remaining public property. ""Limitations on expressive activity  conducted on this last category of property must survive only a much more  limited review. The challenged regulation need only be reasonable, as long as  the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to  disagreement with the speaker's view.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness , 505 U.S. at 679.             Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or      the Provision of Internet Access?     To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first determine  whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the library's collection as a  whole, which includes both print and electronic resources, or the library's  provision of Internet access. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for  expressive purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme Court  has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the physical limits of the  government property at issue, but rather by the specific access that the  plaintiff seeks:   Although . . . as an initial matter a  speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to  public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed  merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the  forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek  general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases  in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach  to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government  property.   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. &  Educ. Fund, Inc. , 473 U.S. 788, 801 (1985).    Thus, in  Cornelius , where the  plaintiffs were legal defense and political advocacy groups seeking to  participate in the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that  the relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire federal  workplace, but rather the charity drive itself.  Id.  at 801. Similarly,  in  Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association ,  460 U.S. 37 (1983), which addressed a union's right to access a public school's  internal mail system and teachers' mailboxes, the Court identified the relevant  forum as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole. In   Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in which a student group  challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its meeting facilities,  the Court identified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to which the  plaintiffs sought access, not the state university generally. And in   Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA ,   148 F.3d 242 (3d  Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendment challenge to the removal of  advertisements from subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted  that the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, but  rather the advertising space within the stations.  Id.  at 248. Although  these cases dealt with the problem of identifying the relevant forum where   speakers  are claiming a right of access, we believe that the same  approach applies to identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking  access are listeners or readers.   In this case, the patron plaintiffs are  not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire  certain books or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Web site  plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry  print materials that they publish. Rather, the right at issue in this case is  the specific right of library patrons to access information on the Internet, and  the specific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons with information  via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum for analysis is not the library's  entire collection, which includes both print and electronic media, such as the  Internet, but rather the specific forum created when the library provides its  patrons with Internet access.   Although a public library's provision of  Internet access does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a  well-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply.   See   Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515  U.S. 819, 830 (1995) (holding that a state university's student activities fund  ""is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense, but the  same principles are applicable"");  see also   Cornelius , 473 U.S.  at 801 (identifying the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant  unit of analysis for application of public forum doctrine).             Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora          Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals,  see   Int'l  Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee , 505 U.S. 672 (1992), military  bases,  see   Greer v. Spock , 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail grounds,   see   Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 (1966), the federal  workplace,  see   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund ,  473 U.S. 788, 805 (1985), and public transit vehicles,  see   Lehman  v. City of Shaker Heights , 418 U.S. 298 (1974), the purpose of a public  library in general, and the provision of Internet access within a public library  in particular, is ""for use by the public . . . for expressive activity,""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983),  namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range of  information. We are satisfied that when the government provides Internet access  in a public library, it has created a designated public forum.  See    Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library , 24  F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998);  cf.   Kreimer v. Bureau of  Police , 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library  is a limited public forum).   Relying on those cases that have  recognized that government has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use  of a designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that  content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with those purposes are  subject only to rational basis review, the government argues for application of  rational basis review to public libraries' decisions about which content to make  available to their patrons via the Internet.  See   Rosenberger ,  515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (""The necessities of confining a forum to the limited  and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in  reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics."");   Perry , 460 U.S. at 46 n.7 (1983) (""A public forum may be created for a  limited purpose such as use by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of  certain subjects."").    In particular, the government forcefully  argues that a public library's decision to limit the content of its digital  offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its  decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the  library's print collection. According to the government, just as a public  library may choose to acquire books about gardening but not golf, without having  to show that this content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is  narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public  library make content-based decisions about which speech to make available on the  Internet, without having to show that such a restriction satisfies strict  scrutiny.   Plaintiffs respond that the government's  ability to restrict the content of speech in a designated public forum by  restricting the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not  unlimited.  Cf.   Legal  Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001)  (""Congress cannot recast a condition on funding  as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be  reduced to a simple semantic exercise.""). As Justice Kennedy has  explained:   If Government has a freer hand to draw  content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from  it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums;  every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or  redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government  to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at  all.   Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium,  Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 801 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the  judgment).   Although we agree with plaintiffs that  the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt  content-based restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely  what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult problem in First  Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's ""cases have not yet determined . .  . that government's decision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content  or another is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local  government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it builds a band  shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)?  The answer is not obvious.""  Denver , 518 U.S. at 750 (plurality  opinion);  see also   Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad ,  420 U.S. 546, 572-73 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""May an opera house  limit its productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May a  municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is it required to  book any potential producer on a first come, first served basis?"").   We believe, however, that certain  principles emerge from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In  particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range  of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through  government grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a  public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in  drawing content-based distinctions.   At one extreme lies the government's  decision to fund a particular message that the government seeks to disseminate.  In this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that government  chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most rational basis review, and  even viewpoint discrimination is permissible. For example, ""[w]hen Congress  established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to  adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C. § 4411(b), it was not constitutionally  required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy  such as communism and fascism.""  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173, 194  (1991);  see also   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541  (""[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the  government is itself the speaker, or in instances, like  Rust , in which  the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its  own program."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    Although not strictly controlling, the  Supreme Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as  Rust  and   Velazquez , are instructive for purposes of analyzing content-based  restrictions on the use of public fora. This is because the limitations that  government places on the use of a public forum can be conceptualized as  conditions that the government attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it  offers, namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thus resemble  those unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment challenges to  the conditions that the state places on the receipt of a government benefit.   See Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 544 (""As this suit involves a subsidy,  limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in the strict sense, yet they  do provide some instruction."").   Even when the government does not fund  the dissemination of a particular government message, the First Amendment  generally permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint  neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and state  universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination of private speech that  the government believes to have particular merit. Thus, in  NEA v.  Finley , 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court upheld the use of content-based  restrictions in a federal program awarding grants to artists on the basis of,   inter alia , artistic excellence. ""The very assumption of the NEA is  that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing  applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable.""  Id.  at  585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained  in his concurring opinion in  Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981),  the First Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state  university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce resources,  including limited public fora such as its meeting facilities:   Because every university's resources are  limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the  use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In  my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to  evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious,  for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a  particular time - one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an  amateur performance of Hamlet - the First Amendment would not require that the  room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I  see why a university should have to establish a ""compelling state interest"" to  defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the  other.   Id.  at 278 (Stevens, J.,  concurring in the judgment). (22)   The more broadly the government  facilitates private speech, however, the less deference the First Amendment  accords to the government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it  facilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designated public forum to  facilitate private speech representing a diverse range of viewpoints, the  government's decision selectively to single out particular viewpoints for  exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny.   Compare   Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 834 (applying heightened  First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited  public forum where the government ""does not itself speak or subsidize  transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a  diversity of views from private speakers""),  with   Finley , 524  U.S. at 586 (""In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many other  subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity of  views from private speakers."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).     Similarly, although the government may  create a designated public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the  government opens the forum to members of the general public to speak on that  topic while selectively singling out for exclusion particular speakers on the  basis of the content of their speech, that restriction is subject to strict  scrutiny. For instance, in  City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v.  Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission , 429 U.S. 167 (1976), the Court  held that where a school board opens its meetings for public participation, it  may not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers other than union  representatives from speaking on the subject of pending collective-bargaining  negotiations.  See   id.  at 175 (noting that the state ""has  opened a forum for direct citizen involvement"");  see also   Ark.  Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes , 523 U.S. 666, 680 (1998)  (distinguishing, for purposes of determining the appropriate level of First  Amendment scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting station  exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating candidates from a  debate that has ""an open-microphone format"").   Finally, content-based restrictions on  speech in a designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny  when the government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use by the general  public for speech on a virtually unrestricted range of topics, while selectively  excluding particular speech whose content it disfavors. Thus, in   Conrad , the Court held that a local government violated the First  Amendment when it denied a group seeking to perform the rock musical ""Hair""  access to a general-purpose municipal theater open for the public at large to  use for performances.  See also   Denver , 518 U.S. at 802  (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that strict scrutiny would  not apply to a local government's decision to ""build[] a band shell in the park  and dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),"" but would apply to  ""the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music might be  performed except for rap music"").   Similarly, in  FCC v. League of Women  Voters of Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened  scrutiny a federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting  stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal  program singled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted to  editorializing. As the Court later explained:   In  FCC v. League of Women Voters of  Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of  the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against  editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even  though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public  funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an  unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the  medium.   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at  543.   In sum, the more widely the state opens  a forum for members of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and  viewpoints, the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to  exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as such  exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state has created in  establishing the forum.  Cf.   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 544  (""Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting  arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the  traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or  student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases . . . ."").     Thus, we believe that where the state  designates a forum for expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the  public at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to  restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum particular speech  whose content is disfavored. ""Laws designed or intended to suppress or restrict  the expression of  specific  speakers contradict basic First Amendment  principles.""  United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803,  812 (2000);  see also   Denver , 518 U.S. at 782 (Kennedy, J.,  concurring in the judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that ""singles out one sort  of speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where  content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted"").  Compare    Forbes , 523 U.S. at 679 (holding that the state does not create a  public forum when it ""allows selective  access  for individual speakers  rather than general access for a class of speakers"") (emphasis added),   with   Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley , 408 U.S.  92, 96 (1972) (""Selective  exclusions  from a public forum may not be  based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content  alone."") (emphasis added).   We note further that to the extent that  the government creates a public forum expressly designed to facilitate the  dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of the public to  speak on any virtually any topic, and then selectively targets certain speech  for exclusion based on its content, the government is singling out speech in a  manner that resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme  Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in  Arkansas Writers'  Project, Inc. v. Ragland , 481 U.S. 221 (1987), and  Minneapolis Star  & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue , 460 U.S. 575  (1983), which we explain in the margin. (23)             Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny                       Selective Exclusion From a ""Vast Democratic Forum""           Applying these principles  to public libraries, we agree with the government that generally the First  Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print  materials to acquire for their collections to only rational review. In making  these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt collection  development criteria that reflect not simply patrons' demand for certain  material, but also the library's evaluation of the material's quality.   See  Bernard W. Bell,  Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment:  Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software , 53  Fed. Comm. L.J. 191, 225 (2001) (""Librarians should have the discretion to  decide that the library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the  satisfaction of the full range of human desires.""). Thus, a public library's  decision to use the last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works of  Shakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer the library to use the  same amount to purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view,  subject to strict scrutiny.  Cf.   NEA v. Finley , 524 U.S. 569  (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's decision to  award NEA grants on the basis of,  inter alia , artistic  excellence).   Nonetheless, we disagree with the  government's argument that public libraries' use of Internet filters is no  different, for First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they  exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis of librarians'  evaluation of their quality. The central difference, in our view, is that by  providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits  patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a  virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons'  access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment,  determines to be particularly valuable.  Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector &  Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995) (applying strict  scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state ""does not itself speak  or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers"").  See generally    supra  Section IV.C.    In those cases upholding the  government's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for  subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state actor exercising  the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that  the forum facilitates. Thus, in  Finley  the NEA examined the content of  those works of art that it chose to subsidize, and in  Arkansas Educational  Television Commission v. Forbes , 523 U.S. 666 (1998), the public  broadcaster specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to  participate in the debate.  See   id.  at 673 (""In the case of  television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakers would  be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their  editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and  statutory obligations."");  Finley , 524 U.S. at 586 (""The NEA's mandate  is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based 'excellence'  threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in   Rosenberger  - which was available to all student organizations that  were 'related to the educational purpose of the University . . . .'"") (quoting   Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 824);  see also   Cornelius v. NAACP  Legal Def. & Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 804 (1985) (""The Government's  consistent policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal  Campaign] to 'appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seeking  admission to obtain permission from federal and local Campaign officials. . . .  [T]here is no evidence suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission  is merely ministerial.""). The essence of editorial discretion requires the  exercise of professional judgment in examining the content that the government  singles out as speech of particular value.   This exercise of editorial discretion is  evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection. As  the government's experts in library science testified, in selecting a book for a  library's collection, librarians evaluate the book's quality by reference to a  variety of criteria such as  its  accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the  authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it  compares with other material available in the same genre or on the same  subject . Thus, the content of every  book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection  development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been  judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection  development policy. Although some public libraries use ""approval plans"" to  delegate the collection development to third-party vendors which provide the  library with recommended materials that the library is then free to retain or  return to the vendor, the same principle nonetheless attains.   In contrast, in providing patrons with  even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech  whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable  by either a librarian or a third party to whom the library has delegated  collection development decisions. Although several of the government's librarian  witnesses who testified at trial purport to apply the same standards that govern  the library's acquisition of print materials to the library's provision of  Internet access to patrons, when public libraries provide their patrons with  Internet access, they intentionally open their doors to vast amounts of speech  that clearly lacks sufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's  print collection. Unless a library allows access to only those sites that have  been preselected as having particular value, a method that, as noted above, was  tried and rejected by the Westerville Ohio Public Library,  see    supra  at 46-47, even a library that uses software filters has opened  its Internet collection ""for indiscriminate use by the general public.""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 47 (1983).  ""[M]ost Internet forums - including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and  the Web - are open to all comers.""  Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 880  (1997).   The fundamental difference between a  library's print collection and its provision of Internet access is illustrated  by comparing the extent to which the library opens its print collection to  members of the public to speak on a given topic and the extent to which it opens  its Internet terminals to members of the public to speak on a given topic. When  a public library chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g. chemistry, it  does not open its print collection to any member of the public who wishes to  write about chemistry. Rather, out of the myriad of books that have ever been  written on chemistry, each book on chemistry that the library carries has been  reviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, in the exercise of  his or her professional judgment, has deemed its content to be particularly  valuable. In contrast, when a public library provides Internet access, even  filtered Internet access, it has created a forum open to any member of the  public who writes about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of how  unscientific the author's methods or of how patently false the author's  conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputation or grammar, and  regardless of the reviews of the scientific community.   Notwithstanding protestations in CIPA's  legislative history to the contrary, (24)   members of the general public do define the content that public libraries make  available to their patrons through the Internet. Any member of the public with  Internet access could, through the free Web hosting services available on the  Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on any subject under the sun, and  tomorrow those musings would become part of public libraries' online offerings  and be available to any library patron who seeks them out.   In providing its patrons with Internet  access, a public library creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almost  none of which either the library's collection development staff or even the  filtering companies have ever reviewed. Although filtering companies review a  portion of the Web in classifying particular sites, the portion of the Web that  the filtering companies actually review is quite small in relation to the Web as  a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process, described in our findings  of fact, is intended to identify only a small fraction of Web sites for the  filtering companies to review. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be  exercising editorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when it  indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to  examine.  Cf.  Bell,  supra , at 226 (""[C]ourts should take a much  more jaundiced view of library policies that block Internet access to a very  limited array of subjects than they take of library policies that reserve  Internet terminals for very limited use."").    While the First Amendment permits the  government to exercise editorial discretion in singling out particularly favored  speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, we believe that  where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[],""  Reno ,  521 U.S. at 868, open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as  diverse as human thought,""  id.  at 870, and then selectively excludes  from the forum certain speech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are  subject to strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentally distorting the  unique marketplace of ideas that public libraries create when they open their  collections, via the Internet, to the speech of millions of individuals around  the world on a virtually limitless number of subjects. (25)   A public library's content-based  restrictions on patrons' Internet access thus resemble the content-based  restrictions on speech subsidized by the government, whether through direct  funding or through the creation of a designated public forum, that the Supreme  Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, as discussed above in Section IV.C.  Although the government may subsidize a particular message representing the  government's viewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny,  see    Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991) , strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that  selectively exclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed to  facilitate a wide range of viewpoints,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector  & Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819 (1995). Similarly, although  the state's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting particular speakers  for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subject to rational basis  review,  see   Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes , 523 U.S.  666 (1998), selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forum otherwise  open to any member of the public to speak are subject to strict scrutiny,   see   City of Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wis. Employment  Relations Comm'n , 429 U.S. 167 (1976).    And while the government may, subject  only to rational basis review, make content-based decisions in selecting works  of artistic excellence to subsidize,  see   NEA v. Finley , 524  U.S. 569 (1998), the Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny where the  government opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use by the public, but  selectively excludes disfavored content,  see   Southeastern  Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad , 420 U.S. 546 (1975), where the government  facilitates the speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitless number of  topics, but prohibits editorializing,  see   FCC v. League of Women  Voters of Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), and where the government funds a wide  range of legal services but restricts funding recipients from challenging  welfare laws,  see   Legal  Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533 (2001) . Similarly, where a public library opens a forum  to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited  number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions  of particular speech whose content the library disfavors.                     Analogy to Traditional Public Fora     Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use of software  filters, in our view, finds further support in the extent to which public  libraries' provision of Internet access promotes First Amendment values in an  analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in  which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict  scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is ""designed for freewheeling  inquiry.""  Bd. of Education v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982)  (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a ""mighty resource in the  free marketplace of ideas,""  Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist. ,  541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976), and represents a ""quintessential locus of the  receipt of information.""  Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown ,  958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992);  see also   Sund v. City of  Wichita Falls , 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 547 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (""The right to  receive information is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library .  . . ."");  cf.   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.  Lee , 505 U.S. 672, 681 (1992) (""[A] traditional public forum is property  that has as 'a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas.'"") (quoting   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 800  (1985)).   We acknowledge that the provision of  Internet access in a public library does not enjoy the historical pedigree of  streets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression. Nonetheless, we  believe that it shares many of the characteristics of these traditional public  fora that uniquely promote First Amendment values and accordingly warrant  application of strict scrutiny to any content-based restriction on speech in  these fora. Regulation of speech in streets, sidewalks, and parks is subject to  the highest scrutiny not simply by virtue of history and tradition, but also  because the speech-facilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes them  distinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many of these same  speech-promoting features of the traditional public forum appear in public  libraries' provision of Internet access.   First, public libraries, like sidewalks  and parks, are generally open to any member of the public who wishes to receive  the speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrow limitations.   See   Kreimer ,  958 F.2d  at  1260  (noting that a public library does not retain unfettered  discretion ""to choose whom it will permit to enter the Library,"" but upholding  the library's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whose offensive  personal hygiene precludes the library's use by other patrons) .  Moreover,   like traditional public fora, public  libraries are funded by taxpayers and therefore do not charge members of the  public each time they use the forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who  wish to receive information, whether via the Internet or the library's print  collection, is the time spent reading.   By providing Internet access to millions  of Americans to whom such access would otherwise be unavailable, public  libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide separating those  with access to new information technologies from those that lack access.  See  generally  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S.  Department of Commerce,  Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital  Divide  (1999),  available at    http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html .  Cf.  Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 546 (invalidating a content-based restriction on the  speech of federally funded legal services corporations and noting that given the  financial hardship of legal services corporations' clients, ""[t]he restriction  on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws  from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel""). Public  libraries that provide Internet access greatly expand the educational  opportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in the margin, would  otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this new medium. (26)   Just as important as the openness of a  forum to listeners is its openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are  paradigmatic loci of First Amendment values in large part because they permit  speakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. One can address  members of the public in a park for little more than the cost of a soapbox, and  one can distribute handbills on the sidewalk for little more than the cost of a  pen, paper, and some photocopies.  See   Martin v. City of  Struthers , 319 U.S. 141, 146 (1943) (""Door to door distribution of  circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people."");  Laurence H. Tribe,  American Constitutional Law  § 12-24 at 987 (2d ed.  1988) (""The 'public forum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should be  subject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal, that speech  occurs in areas playing a vital role in communication - such as in those places  historically associated with first amendment activities, such as streets,  sidewalks, and parks - especially because of how indispensable communication in  these places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (and more costly)  channels.""); Daniel A. Farber,  Free Speech without Romance: Public Choice  and the First Amendment , 105 Harv. L. Rev. 554, 574 n.86 (1991) (noting  that traditional public fora ""are often the only place where less affluent  groups and individuals can effectively express their message""); Harry Kalven,  Jr.,  The Concept of the Public Forum:  Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup. Ct.  Rev. 1, 30 (""[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck, have been  the media of communication exploited by those with little access to the more  genteel means of communication."").    Similarly, given the existence of  message boards and free Web hosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet,  address the public, including patrons of public libraries, for little more than  the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explained in  Reno v.  ACLU , 521 U.S. 844 (1997), ""the Internet can hardly be considered a  'scarce' expressive commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost  capacity for communication of all kinds.""  Id.  at 870. Although the cost  of a home computer and Internet access considerably exceeds the cost of a  soapbox or a few hundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of  the Internet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or the public library.  As Professor Lessig has explained:   The ""press"" in 1791 was not the  New  York Times  or the  Wall Street Journal . It did not comprise large  organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with  each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The  cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within  reason) could become a publisher - and in fact an extraordinary number did. When  the Constitution speaks of the rights of the ""press,"" the architecture it has in  mind is the architecture of the Internet.   Lawrence Lessig,  Code  183  (1999).   While public libraries' provision of  Internet access shares many of the speech-promoting qualities of traditional  public fora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional public fora  cannot. (27)   In particular, whereas the architecture of real space limits the audience of a  pamphleteer or soapbox orator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity,  the Internet renders the geography of speaker and listener  irrelevant:   Through the use of chat rooms, any  person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates  farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail  exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a  pamphleteer.   Reno , 521 U.S. at 870 . By  providing patrons with Internet access, public libraries in effect open their  doors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around the world, inviting  the speech of any member of the public who wishes to communicate with  library patrons via the Internet.   Due to the low costs for speakers and  the irrelevance of geography, the volume of speech available to library  patrons on the Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speech  available to audiences in traditional public fora.  See   id.  at  868 (referring to ""the vast democratic forums of the Internet""). Indeed, as  noted in our findings of fact, the Web is estimated to contain over one billion  pages, and is said to be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day.   See   id.  at 885 (noting ""[t]he dramatic expansion of this new  marketplace of ideas""). This staggering volume of content on the Internet ""is as  diverse as human thought,""  id.  at 870, and ""is thus comparable, from  the reader's viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millions of readily  available and indexed publications,""  id.  at 853. As a result of the  Internet's unique speech-facilitating qualities, ""it is hard to find an aspiring  social movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, without a website, a  bulletin board, and an email list."" Kreimer,  supra  n.27,   at  125. ""[T]he growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal.""   Reno , 521 U.S. at 885.   This extraordinary growth of the  Internet illustrates the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment  values in the same way that the historical use of traditional public fora for  speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to their effectiveness as  vehicles for free speech.  Cf.   Martin , 319 U.S. at 145 (""The  widespread use of this method of communication [door-to-door distribution of  leaflets] by many groups espousing various causes attests its major  importance."");  Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939)  (""[P]amphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of  opinion."").   The provision of Internet access in  public libraries, in addition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora  such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of the  speech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is open to the public  at large as both speakers and recipients of information, and provides a  relatively low-cost means of disseminating information to a geographically  dispersed audience.  See   Lamont v. Postmaster Gen. , 381 U.S.  301 (1965) (invalidating a content-based prior restraint on the use of the  mails);  see also   Blount v. Rizzi , 400 U.S. 410 (1971) (same).  Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postal system in  Lamont   seems equally apt as a description of the Internet today: ""the postal system . .  . is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal  affairs of the people are conducted . . . ."" 381 U.S. at 305 n.3.   In short, public libraries, by providing  their patrons with access to the Internet, have created a public forum that  provides any member of the public free access to information from millions of  speakers around the world. The unique speech-enhancing character of Internet use  in public libraries derives from the openness of the public library to any  member of the public seeking to receive information, and the openness of the  Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. In particular,  speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entry and the ability to reach a  mass audience, unhindered by the constraints of geography. (28)   Moreover, just as the development of new media ""presents unique problems, which  inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which may justify  restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts,""  United States v.  Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), the development of  new media, such as the Internet, also presents unique possibilities for  promoting First Amendment values, which also inform our assessment of the  interests at stake, and which we believe, in the context of the provision of  Internet access in public libraries, justify the application of heightened  scrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject to only rational  review in other contexts, such as the development of the library's print  collection.  Cf.   id.  at 818 (""Technology expands the capacity  to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the  Government is best positioned to make these choices for  us."").   A faithful translation of First  Amendment values from the context of traditional public fora such as sidewalks  and parks to the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internet access in  public libraries requires, in our view, that content-based restrictions on  Internet access in public libraries be subject to the same exacting standards of  First Amendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech in traditional  public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, and parks:   The architecture of the Internet, as it  is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the  founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution,  the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech  that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet - distributed,  noncentralized, fully free and diverse.   Lessig,  Code , at 167, 185.  Indeed, ""[m]inds are not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To an  increasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of  public consciousness occur in mass and electronic media.""  Denver Area Educ.  Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 802-03 (1996) (Kennedy,  J., concurring in the judgment).   In providing patrons with even filtered  Internet access, a public library is not exercising editorial discretion in  selecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in its collection, as  it may do when it decides to acquire print materials. By providing its patrons  with Internet access, public libraries create a forum in which any member of the  public may receive speech from anyone around the world who wishes to disseminate  information over the Internet. Within this ""vast democratic forum[],""   Reno , 521 U.S. at 868, which facilitates speech that is ""as diverse as  human thought,""  id.  at 870, software filters single out for exclusion  particular speech on the basis of its disfavored content. We hold that these  content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech are subject to strict  scrutiny.       Application of Strict Scrutiny     Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies to public libraries'  content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech on the Internet, we must  next determine whether a public library's use of Internet software filters can  survive strict scrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech  ""must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest. If a  less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the  legislature must use that alternative.""  United States v. Playboy Entm't  Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (citation omitted);  see also    Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n , 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d  Cir. 1990) (holding that a content-based burden on speech is permissible ""only  if [the government] shows that the restriction serves a compelling interest and  that there are no less restrictive alternatives"").    The application of strict scrutiny to a  public library's use of filtering products thus requires three distinct  inquiries. First, we must identify those compelling government interests that  the use of filtering software promotes. It is then necessary to analyze whether  the use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests.  Finally, we must determine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that  would promote the state interest.             State Interests     We begin by identifying those legitimate state interests that a public  library's use of software filters promotes.                      Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and        Material Harmful to Minors     On its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent public libraries'  Internet terminals from being used to disseminate to library patrons visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful"

Many losses are suffered by victims who thought they were paying start up costs for a small business of their own.   Pyramid schemes are illegal scams in which large numbers of people pay money to a few people. Each new participant pays for the chance to advance and profit from payments of others who might join later.  Pyramid schemes try to hide their true nature in order to fool potential participants and  evade law enforcers.   To join, a potential participant will have to pay money.  The only way of advancing in a pyramid is to recruit others who also pay money.  If enough new participants continue to join, the pyramid scheme continues to operate.  In order for everyone in a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of new participants.  Often the new recruits are a participant's friends and family.  In reality each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.  The pyramid may collapse at any time.  This places the  participant in the position of victimizing his or her own friends and family.   Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology.  Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money prey upon the potential victim's rational mind and fear of missing a good deal.  Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme.  Victims often find themselves tricked into participating.    It is important to recognize that inherent in the scheme is a double problem for the participant.  First the scheme may collapse as the new participant buys in, causing the participant's new recruits to look to him for refunds.  Second, if law enforcement finds out about the scheme,  prosecutors can file charges against the participant who has introduced others as well as against the promoter since both are considered violators of the law.    Some pyramid promoters try to make their schemes look like multi-level marketing methods.  Multi-level marketing can be a lawful and legitimate business which uses a network of independent distributors to sell consumer products.  The difference between a pyramid scheme and a multi- level marketing plan is that in the latter, money is only made through the retail sale of a product.  Participants can sell without paying to participate in the marketing scheme and consumers can buy without also joining the marketing scheme.   To avoid becoming both a victim and simultaneously violating the law, do not let anyone rush you into making hasty and unwise decisions.  A good opportunity to build a business in a multi-level structure will not disappear over night.  Take time to consider your investment before signing  anything or giving  someone your money.   Ask questions about the company and its officers, the products, their cost, fair market value, source of supply and the potential market in your area.  Ask about start up fees, required purchases and about the company's policy on the buy-back of required purchases.  Inquire about the average earnings of active distributors.   Get written copies of all available company literature.  Consult with others who have had experience with the company and its products.  Check to see if the products are actually being sold to consumers.  Try to determine whether these would be a market for the product if the multi-level  marketing structure did not exist. Verify all information; do not assume that official looking documents are either accurate or complete.    If you suspect that a company may be an illegal pyramid, contact your local law enforcement offices such as the police department, the sheriff's department or the district attorney of the county in which the pyramid is operating.  Every person who contrives, prepares or operates any endless  chain is guilty of a public offense which can be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in state prison for 16 months, two, or three years.
