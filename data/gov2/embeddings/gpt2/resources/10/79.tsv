Joints     from  Biomechanical Basis of Human Movement  by Joseph Hamill and Katheen M. Knutzen, Williams & Wilkins 1995, ISBN: 0-683-03863-X     Types of Diarthrodial Joints      Simple, Compound, and Complex Joints    The articulating surfaces found in the different joints in the body vary in size and shape. There is typically a concave surface on the adjacent bone, termed female and male surfaces, respectively. Also, there can be more than two contact points or articulating surfaces. A joint with only two articulating surfaces is termed a simple joint, while a joint with three or more articulating surfaces is known as a compound joint. A joint with more than two articulating surfaces and with a disc or fibrocartilage is called a complex joint. An example of a simple joint is the hip or the ankle (talotibial), of a compound joint is the wrist, and of a complex joint is the knee.    Close-Packed vs Loose-Packed Positions    As movement occurs through a range of motion, the actual contact area varies between the articulating surfaces.    The Plane or Gliding Joint    The first type of joint is the plane or gliding joint, found in the foot between the tarsals and in the hand among the carpals. Movement at this type of joint does not occur about an axis and is termed non-axial since it consists of two flat surfaces that slide over each other to allow movement. In the hand, for example, the carpals will slide over each other as the hand is moved to positions of flexion, extension, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation. Likewise, in the foot, the tarsals shift during pronation and supination, sliding over each other in the process.    The Hinge Joint    The hinge (ginglymus) joint allows movement in one plane (flexion, extension) and is termed uniaxial. Examples of the hunge joint in the body are the interphalangeal joints of the phalanges in the foot and hand, and the ulnohumeral articulation at the elbow.    The Pivot Joint    The pivot joint also allows movement in one plane (rotation; pronation, supination) and is uniaxial. Pivot joints are located at the superior and inferior radioulnar joint and the atlantoaxial articulation at the base of the skull.    The Condylar Joint    The condylar joint is a joint allowing primary movement in one plane flexion, extension) with small amounts of movement in another plane (rotation). It is found at the knee joint and the temporomandibular joint.    The Ellipsoid Joint    The ellipsoid joint allows movement in two planes (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction) and is biaxial. Examples of this joint can be found at the radiocarpal articulation at the wrist and the metacarpophalangeal articulation in the phalanges.    The Saddle Joint    The saddle joint only found at the carpometacarpal articulation of the thumb, allows two planes of motion (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction) with a small amount of rotation also allowed. It is similar to the ellipsoid joint in function.     The Ball-and-Socket Joint    The last type of diarthrodial joint, the ball-and-socket joint allows movement in three planes (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction; rotation) and is the most mobile of the diarthrodial joint. The hip and shoulder joints are example of ball-and-socket joints.       Other Types of Joints      Synarthrodial or Fibrous Joints    There are other articulations that are limited in movement characteristics but, nonetheless, play an important role in stabilization of the skeletal system. Some bones are held together by fibrous articulations, such as those found in the sutures of the skull. These articulations, referred to as synarthrodial, allow little or no movement to occur between the bones and hold the bones firmly together.     Amphiarthrodial or Cartilaginous Joints    There are also cartilaginous joint, called amphiarthodial, that are bones held together by either hyaline cartilage, such as is found at the epiphyseal plates , or by fibrocartilage, found at the pubic symphysis and the intervertebral articulations. The movement at these articulations is also very limited, although not to the degree of the synarthodial joints.
