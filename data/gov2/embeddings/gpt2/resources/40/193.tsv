GX094-82-7729849	"Census Bureau Section 515 Information Quality Guidelines                 The Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency of the Federal Government.  While best   known for the decennial census of population and housing, it conducts other surveys and   censuses that measure changing individual and household demographics and the economic   condition of the Nation.  The Census Bureau is responsible for quinquennial censuses of   manufactures, retail trade, wholesale trade, service industries, finance, insurance, real estate,   transportation, communication, utilities, mining, and governments.  The Census Bureau also   conducts approximately 200 surveys per year.  It is the source of household demographic surveys   sponsored by other Federal agencies, as well as by the Census Bureau.  It is also the source of the   country's official population estimates and projections that are used as the basis for allocating   federal funds each year.  Monthly, quarterly, and annual establishment surveys are funded by   Congressional appropriation to yield information on the current state of the economy.  Census   Bureau economic surveys provide a majority of the information the Bureau of Economic   Analysis uses to update Gross Domestic Product estimates, the data used by the Bureau of Labor   Statistics in reporting Producer Price changes, and the data used by the Federal Reserve Board as   input to indices of industrial production and capacity utilization.       Census Bureau programs support Department of Commerce Strategic Planning Goal 1:  Provide   the Information and the Framework to Enable the Economy to Operate Efficiently and Equitably ,   Objective 1.3:  Support Effective Decision-Making of Policymakers, Businesses, and the   American Public .       High quality publicly available statistics from Federal statistical organizations are essential for a   nation to advance the economic well-being and quality of life of its people. The statistical   information products provided by the Bureau of the Census are influential, shaping important   policy decisions that help improve our Nation's social and economic conditions:            Census Bureau data are used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding.       Census Bureau data are essential for estimating the gross domestic product (GDP) and     leading economic indicators.       Census Bureau data determine the apportionment of Congressional seats, as mandated in the     Constitution.       Census Bureau data inform us about education, income, poverty, and health insurance     coverage.       National, state, and local governments use Census Bureau data to formulate policy.       Large corporations and local businesses use Census Bureau data to devise their business     plans.             The Census Bureau is one of 10 principal statistical agencies in the Federal government. A   statistical agency, as defined in the  Federal Register  January 29, 1996 (Volume 61, Number 20,   pages 2875-2879), is an agency or organizational unit of the Executive Branch whose activities   are predominantly the collection, compilation, processing or analysis of information for   statistical purposes.  Statistical agencies have long been leaders in the development and   implementation of quality guidelines for information products.         The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in its February 22, 2002 issuance of   government-wide information quality guidelines, recognizes that Federal statistical organizations   provide a substantial variety of data.  Accordingly, while the Census Bureau is part of       a joint   Federal statistical agency notice on information quality guidelines , it presents its specific response to the   OMB directive on quality, including utility, objectivity, and integrity.  The Census Bureau considers   its published statistical information to be ""influential,"" and does not distinguish among the many data   it releases annually those which are more or less influential.  The original and supporting data it   collects and develops to generate its statistical information products are covered by the same   quality guidelines as the information it disseminates, and are proprietary and confidential.    The Census Bureau will demonstrate in its Paperwork Reduction Act clearance packages that each such draft information    collection will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with all applicable   information quality guidelines.  Analyses it conducts that become part of Census Bureau statistical information products are   covered by the same quality guidelines.  There is  a process in place for adding disclaimers to work produced under grants and   awards, and papers  written and speeches given by Census Bureau employees, which do not fall under section 515 information    quality guidelines as long as the documents are not disseminated by the Census Bureau.   These information quality  guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar    communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information the    Census Bureau has disseminated elsewhere.  These guidelines do not cover archival information disseminated by the Census Bureau   before October 1, 2002, and still maintained by the Census Bureau as archival material.  Nor do these guidelines cover    information limited to adjudicative processes, such as pleadings, including information developed during the conduct of    any criminal or civil action or administrative enforcement action, investigation or audit against specific parties, or    information distributed in documents limited to administrative action determining the rights and liabilities of specific    parties under applicable statutes and regulations.  Third-party information, such as from states and local governments, may   be included in information that the Census Bureau disseminates.     Although third-party sources may not be directly subject to Section 515, information from such sources, when used by the    Census Bureau to develop information products, must be of known quality and consistent with the Census Bureau's information quality guidelines.     When such information is used, any limitations, assumptions, collection methods, or uncertainties concerning it are taken into account    and disclosed.         These guidelines cover information disseminated by the Census Bureau on or after October 1, 2002, regardless as to when the information   was first disseminated.  However, the pre-dissemination review procedures incorporated in the guidelines shall be applied only to    information first disseminated by the Census Bureau on or after October 1, 2002.  Disseminated information covered by these guidelines    shall comply with all applicable DOC and OMB Information Quality Guidelines.       In implementing these guidelines, the Census Bureau acknowledges that ensuring the quality of information is an important management    objective that takes its place alongside other Census Bureau objectives, such as ensuring the success of Census Bureau missions,    observing budget and resource priorities and restraints, and providing useful information to the public.  The Census Bureau intends    to implement these guidelines in a way that will achieve all these objectives in a harmonious way.       These guidelines use the definitions for ""quality,"" ""utility,"" ""objectivity,"" ""integrity,"" ""information,"" ""government information,""    ""dissemination,"" ""influential,"" and ""reproducibility"" found in the OMB Final Guidelines published in the  Federal Register , Vol.    67, No. 36, February 22, 2002.     These guidelines may be revised periodically, based on experience, evolving requirements at the Census Bureau, and concerns expressed by the public.          The Census Bureau maintains the quality of its data and information products by setting high   standards of performance in its activities.  These activities include:           The development of      concepts and methods;       The planning and design      of surveys and other means of collecting data;       The collection of data;       The processing and editing of        data;       The analysis of data;       The production of estimates or     projections;       The establishment of review procedures; and       The dissemination of data by      published reports, electronic files, and other media requested by users.                                Utility     The Census Bureau shall ensure that information disseminated to the public shall be useful to its intended users.    The requirements of utility are ongoing for a Federal statistical agency like the Census Bureau, which must be engaged in the continual    development of more useful data.        In establishing its priorities for statistical programs for the purpose of   providing objective information that is relevant to policy and   program needs, the Census Bureau works closely with the users of   information in the executive branch, the Congress, interested   nongovernmental people and groups, advisory committees, and the   sponsors of its reimbursable surveys, as well as conducting ongoing   surveys of data users and product reviews.  The demographic and   economic data and information the Census Bureau produces are critical to   understanding the health and well-being of the population, business and   industry. Our goals and programs reflect a commitment to respond to the   Nation's growing need for extensive, timely, and accurate data to   understand the increasing complexities of its population and its economy.        The data content requirements of some of our key programs, such as   the decennial census, are reviewed by OMB and by the Congress.  The   Constitution of the United States mandates the taking of the census every   ten years, and the decennial census is the foundation on which our   democratic system of government is built.  Title 13 of the United States   Code includes provisions about how the decennial census shall be taken,   and also grants authority for the economic censuses, which seek to   measure virtually all economic activity in the U.S.         The Census Bureau maintains ongoing contact with a broad spectrum   of users to ensure that its information continues to remain relevant.     Information collected by the Census Bureau is designed to provide measures that are relevant.    These measures are released to the public as official statistics.  Relevance is the     degree to which information products provide useful information for both current needs     and anticipated future needs.             The Census Bureau disseminates statistical information products to the public in a timely manner.     Timeliness encompasses frequency of data dissemination, as well as the closeness    of the release to the data's reference period.  Efforts are made to collect and publish data   in a time interval that allows high quality data to be disseminated to the public and also    ensures that the information is usable.        The Census Bureau disseminates statistical information products to the public    in a manner that allows them to be accessible to a broad range of data users with    different requirements for data availability and understandability.     Accessibility is the ease of access or effort needed for customers to acquire statistical data,    products, or services.  The Census Bureau conducts usability tests to ensure that its statistical    products are accessible and understandable to its data users.        The Census Bureau strives for ongoing improvements to meet our   customers' expectations for ease of access, quick turnaround times,   simple interface mechanisms, and comparability among different    data sources.   We also continually enhance the quality of our products   and services through greater functionality in data collection instruments as   we migrate to e-commerce and computer-assisted technologies.                                 Objectivity     The Census Bureau shall provide information that is accurate, reliable    and unbiased and shall ensure that its information products are presented in an accurate, clear,    complete and unbiased manner.  This objectivity is achieved by using reliable data sources and   sound analytical techniques and by using highly qualified people to prepare data products that are   carefully reviewed.        In the area of statistical information, objectivity also requires   acknowledging that errors in statistical estimates are unavoidable.  These   areas generally fall under the categories of ""sampling"" and ""nonsampling""   errors.  Sampling errors result when estimates are based on a sample and   not a complete canvass of the population of interest (as in a census).  The   Census Bureau provides information quantifying what is known about the   magnitude of these errors, such as variances or coefficients of variation to   quantify the magnitude of sampling errors.  Though quantifying   nonsampling errors is more difficult, the Census Bureau provides what   information it can on their magnitude.       The Census Bureau's commitment to quality and professional standards of   practice includes: the use of modern statistical theory and practice in all   technical work; the development of strong staff expertise in the disciplines   relevant to our mission; the implementation of ongoing quality assurance   programs to improve data validity and reliability, including improving the   processes of compiling, editing, and analyzing data; and the development   of a strong and continuing relationship with appropriate professional   organizations in the fields of statistics and relevant subject-matter areas.         Use of Reliable Data Sources         The Census Bureau bases its information products  on reliable,   accurate data that have been validated.      The Census Bureau assumes    responsibility for determining sources of data (including administrative records    and other data sources),  measurement methods, and methods of data collection and    processing for its censuses and surveys while minimizing respondent burden.  This    encompasses the development and determination of survey requirements and objectives,    precision desired, geographic scope, collection mode and respondent, the sampling frame,   sample design, estimation specifications, variance estimation specifications, and other    quality measurement specifications.        The Census Bureau builds measurement of quality, process control,   and performance into its data collection processes, thereby making   evident the quality and objectivity of its statistics.  The secure handling   of collected data will be assured by appropriate means throughout the   entire data collection process to preserve confidentiality and privacy.        The Census Bureau comprehensively documents all components of the   data collection process to assure the consistency of our processes.          Use of Sound Analytic Techniques             The Census Bureau uses sound analytical techniques to ensure   objectivity in our statistical information products.  The Census Bureau   assumes responsibility for determining and employing appropriate   methods of analysis.  We evaluate the techniques used to analyze data,   continually searching for more effective, accurate, and reliable analysis   tools.  We evaluate and report on the quality of our analyses.         The Census Bureau performs appropriate statistical tests, addressing   the characteristics of the sample design in official products, and   documents measures of sampling error.   Preliminary quality checking   and exploratory data analysis techniques are utilized to identify, where   possible, instances of nonsampling error, including missing data,   measurement error, processing error, and specification error.  Additional   quality checks are used to prevent errors in the analysis, including the data   used for the analysis; the computations; and the text, tables, and figures   used to report the analysis results.           Pre-Dissemination Review Required for the Release of Data                   All documents released by the Census Bureau undergo an extensive   review that encompasses the content, statistical and survey   methodology, and policy implications of the document.   The review ensures that   the data and text of the document meet Census Bureau standards for quality.  If a potential   data product is determined by the Census Bureau as unfit for use because it does not meet    Census Bureau requirements for quality, the Census Bureau reserves the right to withhold    the data product from dissemination to the public.         Informing Users of Data Quality and Methodology             The Census Bureau informs users of the concepts and methodologies   used in collecting and processing the data, the quality of the data it   produces, and other features of the data that may affect their use or   interpretation.   The availability of sound methodological practices and   the use of those methodologies are critical in ensuring the quality of the   statistics.  By providing information on methodology and concepts to data   users, the Census Bureau will enable users to make judgments and verify   that the data they are using are similar in conceptual framework and   definitions to the data they need to complete their work.  It also allows   users to more accurately assess the errors which restrict their use of the   data.  Specifically:        Statistical products are accompanied by descriptions of, or references to    descriptions of, the methods and procedures used in their development, and    other information about the data that may affect its use.         The documentation provided to users conveys useful information on   data quality, and engenders an awareness of quality as an issue in the   proper use of the data.         The Census Bureau provides indicators of the quality of the statistical    information it disseminates to the public, along with definitions and descriptions    of the concepts and methods.         The information on methodology provided or referenced permits the user to    determine whether the data adequately approximate what they wish to measure, and    whether the estimates they wish to use were produced with tolerances acceptable for    their intended purpose.         The level of information provided in documentation on data quality or   methodology depends on the type of data collection, data sources, and   analysis; confidentiality protection required by statute; the medium of   dissemination; the range and impact of uses of the data; and the total   budget of the statistical program.                  Policy for correcting errors            In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the Census Bureau has   established mechanisms providing the public with the opportunity to seek   correction of information disseminated by the organization that does not   comply with our information quality guidelines.   Corrective actions will   vary. Possibilities include immediate correction or replacement of information on the   Census Bureau website ( http://www.census.gov ), revision of   subsequent issues of recurring products, and issuance of errata for   printed reports and other data products.   Written or electronic requests   for correction communicated to the Census Bureau should specifically   identify the information or procedures of concern, explain why the information is not   in compliance with the information quality guidelines, indicate any potential adverse impact, and   provide a return address for our response.  If we agree that an error was   made, we will determine if the data will be corrected.  These guidelines   are not intended to imply any rights of individuals to request amendment   of their own records beyond those permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 or   other organization specific laws .    Click here to access the complete   correction request procedure .                                 Integrity     Information disseminated by the Census Bureau to the public, independent of the    specific distribution mechanism, shall be safeguarded from improper access, modification,   or destruction.  The Census Bureau will ensure that disseminated information, including    original and supporting information, is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude    of harm that could result from the loss, misuse or unauthorized access to or modification    of such information.       All electronic information disseminated to the public by the Census Bureau adheres to the    standards set out in Appendix I, ""Security of Federal Automated Information Resources""; OMB   Circular A-130; the Computer Security Act; and the Government Information Systems Reform Act.       Confidentiality of data collected by every agency within the Department of Commerce is    safeguarded under legislation including the Privacy Act and titles 13, 15, and 22 of the    U.S. Code.  For any formal statistical data releases to the public, the Census Bureau    maintains strict procedures to protect premature disclosure of the data before the publicly    scheduled date and time of the release.                 Transparency and Reproducibility                                In adopting Information Quality performance standards for objectivity, the Census Bureau    will continue its long-standing practice of making our statistical information as transparent   as possible.  Census Bureau quality guidelines require that our statistical products be    accompanied by descriptions of or references to descriptions of the methods and procedures used    in their development and other information about the data that may affect its use.  The Census    Bureau provides indicators of the quality of the statistical information it disseminates to the    public, along with definitions and descriptions of the concepts  and methods. The information on    methodology provided or referenced permits the user to determine whether the data adequately    approximate what they wish to measure, and whether the estimates they wish to use were produced    with tolerances acceptable for their intended purpose. While the Census Bureau utilizes internal    peer review to ensure quality in content and subject matter as well as in the application of    statistical methodology, and external peer review in content development for many of our programs,    and for the review of results in our most highly critical activities, it fully meets    OMB section 515    requirements of objectivity in analytic results by ensuring disclosure of the specific quantitative    methods and assumptions that have been employed, and the disclosure of error sources affecting    data quality.       Statistical information products disseminated to the public by the Census Bureau must be reproducible    following prescribed methodology.  Reproducibility means that there is the capability to use the    documented methods on the same data set to achieve a consistent result.  Documentation provided by    the Census Bureau must allow results to be repeated.  However, data released by the Census Bureau    generally will not be directly reproducible by the public because the underlying data sets used to    produce them are confidential.  In such cases, our documented methods can be reviewed by users in    lieu of an actual recreation of the results. In addition, some results may not be easily reproduced    by third parties due to the complexity and detail of the methods and data.  In these cases, greater    emphasis is placed on periodic review by outside panels of technical experts, and we apply especially    rigorous robustness checks, as described in our Performance Principles for Census Bureau activities (below).        Some statistical information is not available to the public because of its sensitive and proprietary    nature, or because it is unfit for use.  For example, while the original and supporting data the    Census Bureau collects and develops to generate its statistical information products are covered by    the same quality guidelines and statistical standards as the information it disseminates, the original   and supporting data are proprietary and confidential and not subject to reproducibility requirements.     Additionally, if a potential data product is determined by the Census Bureau as unfit for use because    it does not meet Census Bureau requirements for quality, the Census Bureau reserves the right to withhold    the data product from dissemination to the public.  Whether statistical information products are fit for    use depends on the intended uses and on their fundamental characteristics of quality as defined in the    Census Bureau's quality principles and quality standards, as well as on the expectations of users for    what is acceptable for these characteristics of quality.  The range of quality characteristics    underlying fitness for use includes relevance, accuracy, timeliness, interpretability, and coherence.         Finally, we also achieve transparency through the wide dissemination of our   information.   Many reports and other data products are available both as printed and   electronic documents.  They are announced on the Census Bureau web site and most   electronic versions can be accessed and downloaded directly from the site.  The Census   Bureau is committed to making every document on its internet server accessible to all.    Currently, we are reviewing our site and making modifications to those pages which are   not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.                                        Performance Priniciples for Census Bureau Activities            The development of      concepts and methods;       The planning and design      of surveys and other means of collecting data;       The collection of data;       The processing and editing of        data;       The analysis of data;       The production of estimates or     projections;       The establishment of review procedures; and       The dissemination of data by      published reports, electronic files, and other media requested by users.

This is what ALA's Intellectual   Freedom Office was so thrilled with, especially section 9.   ********   PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES   USE OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS   EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000   The following procedures are designed to facilitate the equitable   distribution of electronic resources at all Alachua County Library   District locations.   1. Computer workstations are designed for use by one person. Exceptions   may be made by library staff.   2. Patrons are allowed to download from the Internet to a disk only.   Patrons must provide their own disk.   3. Patrons' personal software or hardware may not be used or installed on   library equipment.   4. Printing from Internet Workstations is available at a nominal cost to   the patron. There is no limit to the number of pages a patron can print.   5. All copyright laws apply to the Internet workstations. Refer patrons   with questions to the posted signs at the print release stations and   provide copies at the service desk for patron review.   6. Because workstations are located in public areas, what is viewed is not   private. Under Florida Statute Chapters 847.011(1) and 847.0133(1), the   display of obscene materials to minors, viewing child pornography and the   printing of such materials is illegal and punishable. Staff who observe or   have patrons report these situations should contact their Department   Manager or person-in-charge. Document the incident with a Problem Behavior   Report.   7. All standard Internet Workstations are equipped with privacy screens.   Staff should remove a privacy screen only upon a patron request. All   workstations are set to ""time out"" after a set period of no activity.   8. Patron comments about Internet service or content should be handled   through discussion as any other complaint or concern. If patrons wish to   formally comment on Internet content, staff should give them a ""Patron   Comment on Materials"" form to complete. The completed form will be   forwarded to the Automated Services Coordinator within one working day of   its receipt by library staff. The Automated Services coordinator will   appoint a staff committee to review the challenged internet content in   light of the INTERNET ACCESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMER. This committee will   then formulate a written recommendation, responding to the patron comment   and will forward this recommendation to the Library Director within four   (4) weeks of the committee appointment. (This process is similar to the   one in place for comments on print and audio-visual materials.)   Within one week of receiving the committee's recommendation, the Library   Director will prepare a final written response to the patron. This   response will be forwarded to the patron and to the Board of Trustees.   Comments relating to adding or deleting websites from a filtered   workstation will be reviewed and the committee will forward the request to   the Library Director who will forward the request to FIRN, if appropriate,   and will respond to the patron. At any time, patrons will be able to   communicate directly with FIRN from our screens, if they wish to do so.   9. On all Internet workstations, patrons will be able to choose, from a   menu, filtered or unfiltered access to the Internet. Library staff will   not monitor, control or restrict anyone's access to the range of   information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law.   Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access   of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet   and other forms of electronic information. Children who visit the library   without a parent or guardian will be responsible for their own decisions   and behaviors.   10. When necessary, to facilitate access to high-demand resources, staff   in-charge can change the designated login on a workstation.   11. Internet users will have access to Web-based and AFN e-mail, chat and   games within the limits of State/Federal law. The Library District does   not provide e-mail accounts for users but simply provides access to   patrons' existing e-mail accounts   *********   And here's our SIGNUP PROCEDURE:   *********   PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES   SIGN-UP OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS   EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000   To ensure equitable access to Internet Workstations for all library users,   Branch or Department Managers may deem it necessary to sign-up patrons for   Internet use during peak hours. When sign-up is used, all library   facilities will adhere to the following guidelines.   1. Patrons must schedule a session for the Internet workstations at the   public service desk, using existing sign-up sheets supplied by HQPS.   2. A scheduled session is at least a 30 minute block of time. Sessions are   scheduled on the half-hour or hour. Each Branch Manager shall establish a   consistent timetable of half hour and/or hourly sessions. Timetables   should be compatible with traffic patterns in the library.   For example:   Timetable A: indicates a peak traffic pattern 2pm-closing Monday - Friday   and weekends.   10 am -2 pm Monday-Friday sessions are 1 hour.   2 pm-closing Monday-Friday sessions are 30 minutes   Saturday-Sunday sessions are 30 minutes   Timetable B: indicates peak traffic pattern all open library hours.   30 minute sessions all open library hours   Timetable C: indicates ample available equipment during all open library   hours including peak.   1 hour sessions all open library hours   3. Patrons may sign up for the next available session at the end of their   1st session.   4. Scheduled sessions are limited to 2 per person per day.   5. Reservations can be taken, either in-person or on the phone, for same   day or next library business day.   6. If a patron does not arrive within 5 minutes after the session is   scheduled to begin, library staff can offer it to another patron.   7. Internet Workstations are available during the hours the library is   open. In order to facilitate printing, finishing documents, etc. at   closing time, the last scheduled session will be one hour before closing.   ***********   The thing that makes this work is a series of screens designed by our   staff where the user has to FIRST, agree to accept our internet policy,   and SECOND, choose either filtered or unfiltered use. If you don't   accept, OR don't choose to filter or not, you can't get to the Internet.   This solution was thought up by a committee of our staff and we all   thought it was brilliant. We still do...but of course we still get   complaints! -ch   Carol Hole   Alachua County Library   Gainesville, FL     chole@exchange.acld.lib.fl.us                 Last updated:  07/17/2003         by Theresa C.

GX232-40-3694918	"INTERNET ACCESS POLICY I. PURPOSE. The Internet, as an information resource, enables the Library to provide access to a vast array of law- related information, ideas, commentary, and research tools beyond the confines of its own collection. The Law Library believes that the Internet's vast resources should be broadly available. However, all users of electronic information resources such as the Internet are also e xpected to use these resources in a responsible manner, consistent with the law- related educational and informational purposes for which the Law Library provides access, and subject to the following guidelines. II. DISCLAIMER. A. The Library does not vouch for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of information obtained through the Internet. Verifying the accuracy of information is the responsibility of the originator or producer, and assessing accuracy and timeliness of information is the responsibility of the user. B. Internet resources may contain material of a controversial nature. Selection policies governing the Library's acquisition of library materials are not applicable to general Internet access. The Library does not endorse any viewpoints represented on the Internet, but does not attempt to control access to or content of materials available on the Internet, and can not protect users from offensive information. C. The Library currently accesses the Internet through Maricopa County's proxy server. The County has decided to prevent access to certain sites. The Library does not necessarily endorse the use of a proxy server, and has not been involved in determining which sites may or may not be accessed. If you have any problems or concerns about t he limitations imposed by proxy server access, or if you are denied access to a site you believe is of research value, please contact the Library's reference staff. D. Library system menus may identify specific resources and starting points for research. However, the Library can not control Internet access points, which can change rapidly and unpredictably. E. The Library assumes no responsibility for any damages, direct or indirect, arising from use of its computer and network facilities, or from provision of access to Internet services. III.

F. In a manner that disrupts or interferes with other Library computer users. This includes, but is not limited to: harassment of others, and displaying or printing text or graphics that may reasonably be construed as offensive to others. G. Use of Library system resources to falsely represent yourself or the Library. IV. LIMITATIONS ON USE.

A. The Library reserves the right to regularly delete files from computer and network disk drives. B. The Library reserves the right to impose time limitations on the use of Library computers. C.

Permanent barriers to creating                      noninfringing copies goes far beyond the constitutional copyright                      protection that protects works ""by securing for limited                      times"".

A large number of digital media works are released                        with extra material not available in analog format. Therefore,                        following the Register's own logic, it is reasonable to                        create an exemption to allow users to access these works                        if the use is legitimate and lawful.

The                        problem is: 1) Criminals are implementing copyrighted technology                        that controls access to works which may be considered protected                        under the DMCA (i.e., the tool used is copyrighted and the                        work protected is copyrighted), 2) Government agencies often                        lack the ability to create tools capable of circumventing                        copyrighted works protected by copyrighted technological                        measures; therefore relying on the private sector to make                        tools available. The DMCA does not make exceptions when                        1) the copyrighted tool used to protect access was used                        for criminal activity, 2) the protected work involves criminal                        activity, or 3) the trafficking of circumventing tools when                        designed for use in situations where there are exemptions                        such as the need to access protected works in the course                        of an investigation.                                                                                                                                                              Comment                                           comment                      text  (2 pages)                                                                                                                                                                        8                                                                 Anthony                        Burokas                                                                                Class                                            All Classes:                      literary works; musical works; dramatic works; pantomimes                      and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural                      works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound                      recordings; and architectural works.                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary                                            We                          need to ensure an individual's access to works they create                          or purchase.                         First: Current encription and digital watermarking prohibit                          an individual from making as many digital copies of their                          own created muscal works as they want. I record my music                          on Minidisk. I digitally copy it to a CD Recorder. I then                          try to make dupes of that master CD in the CD recorder                          but this is impossible. I am disallowed access to my own                          music through the implimentation of SCMS ""bits""                          that mark one an original, another a copy and prohibit                          any copies of copies. If I lose my original, I cannot                          access my music for any digital duplication because of                          the hardware restrictions that already exist in the market.                         Secondly, when I purchase musical works or motiopn pictures                          (for example), I fully expect to be able to access that                          music on any and all means available to me. However, current                          CD ""protection"" schemes actually inhibit the                          playback of said CDs on my Macintosh. The simply do not                          work, and caused the computer to be unable to eject the                          CD. Another example: I purchase a DVD for home enjoyment,                          but do not have a DVD for the children to watch in the                          car. I would like to make a VHS copy of the DVD but copy                          protection means I, and my children, cannot access the                          movie in the car. I am forced to purchase the motion picture                          twice. Another consideration: For convenience I prefer                          a single CD of 150 MP3 songs (that I legally own) to having                          to bring along 10-15 different CD's with 10-15 songs each                          and change them every hour in the car. I don't want to                          deal with CD cases, swapping disks and all that while                          on the road. It is safer and more convenient for me to                          access my music on one MP3 CD I create of my own music.                          I paid for the right to access my media, I should be allowed                          to access it where, and how, I see fit.

Motion pictures stored on DVDs are usually encrypted.                          2. Encryption of motion picture on a DVD prevents fair                          uses of the motion picture.                          3. Fair uses of a copyrighted work are legal, so circumvention                          of encrpytion for these purposes should be exempt.

While ""Trading""                          (Stealing) or sale of physical reproductions of such works                          should clearly be illegal, the current regulations, which                          consist of a blanket ban against the breaking of digital                          copy protection methods inhibit fair use of products legally                          purchased in the following ways.                         1) Copy protection methods currently in force can prevent                          the legal playing of protected works in most computer's                          sound systems, and occasionally in Auto CD players, and                          even more rarely in some makes and models of dedicated                          Home CD players.                         2) Current regulations make illegal any methods of compressing                          such copy protected files for otherwise legal listening                          on commercially available ""MP3 Players"" (much                          like a ""walkman"", or Automobile sound system                          MP3 decks.) Such compression allows the user to carry                          with them a much larger number of songs than would be                          practicable in the native cd format.                         3) Current rules are the logical equivalent of executing                          all of the residents of a town to make sure you get the                          one serial killer among them. This alone classifies the                          current regulations as ""Not in the public interest""                         4) Copying digital media for legal, ""Fair Use"",                          purposes is not an exercise in ""Interstate Commerce""                          and is therefore not subject to Federal Regulation.                         I would add, as an aside, that I am both a musician and                          a professional software publisher. As such I most certainly                          do not approve of the pirating of Copyrighted materials.                          None the less, preserving the legal concept of ""Fair                          Use"" is beneficial not only to the end users of such                          products, but to the producers of those products as well.

The DCMA can be interpreted as making the publishing of                          information related to security flaws that if exploited                          would lead to circumventing some protection mechanism                          illegal. This is not consistant with the first amendment,                          nor is it consistant with common sense - we need the flaws                          to be identified so they can be fixed, particularly when                          they relate to the protection of computer systems from                          malicious exploitation. Therefore, it is important to                          exempt and exclude these text documents. An executable                          computer program whose purpose is the circumvention of                          a protection measure would not be included in the class,                          but a description of how such a program could be written                          would be included.

Circumvention                          of access controls for Public Domain works can not be                          a violation of 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(C) since that section                          refers only to copyrighted works.                         2.Commercially distributed software that is distributed                          with the intention of gathering information on users surreptitiously                          without their knowledge or consent is called ""Spyware""                          by computer security specialists. While obstensively the                          Spyware program is distributed to perform one function,                          it is actually a Trojan Horse collecting information about                          the user of the software without their knowledge and relaying                          it back to the distributer of the software. It uses the                          same technology and means of distribution as computer                          viruses. The only difference is that Spyware is less malicious                          than many computer viruses which may collect passwords                          and credit card numbers to commit fraud. Computer viruses                          may use encryption to change their appearance and hide                          their true operations. Spyware also uses encryption to                          hide the information collected, transmitted, or to prevent                          reverse engineering of the code to determine just what                          it truly is doing. Since Spyware is a computer program                          it is also a copyrighted work that may also claim to be                          using encryption to control access to its workings or                          as a part of a copy protection ""technology.""                          The prohibition on circumvention affects the ability of                          computer security specialists to determine what is or                          is not Spyware and what information has been compromised.

Non infringing use prevented - evaluation of the security                          of software packages. In particular, security audits assessing                          the likelihood that unauthorized users can utilize installed                          software to illegally hijack the resources of the computer                          system in which this software is installed.                         How this circumvents the encryption - the testing process                          unencrypts portions of the binary translation by describing                          any potentially dangerous and/or subversive behaviors                          the software possesses that may pose a threat to system                          integrity.                         Why this is otherwise protected - ""Clean room""                          implementations of software (precise descriptions of software                          behavior which exactly duplicate the behavior of another                          system created without access to the original software's                          unencrypted content) are protected under fair use (IBM                          lawsuit to prevent i386 clones). In addition, the quoting                          of portions of content for reporting purposes is explicitly                          permitted under fair use doctrine.                         Harm 1- Encourages non-US security researchers to explicitly                          prevent US citizens from accessing their work. (See RedHat                          advisory board for RHLinux for details of one such example                          (1)) This is done to protect researchers in countries                          that do not accept the validity of the DMCA within their                          borders from potential lawsuits in the US. This places                          US system administrators at a disadvantage against potential                          attackers since they are denied access to descriptions                          of how attackers can hijack their systems resources (preventing                          the deployment of countermeasures) while criminal attackers                          have full access.                         Harm 2- Discourages prompt reporting of system flaws                          to system administrators. Since those reporting flaws                          can experience (and have been threatened with) legal retaliation                          by software manufacturers, there is a significant disincentive                          to provide the information necessary to enact effective                          countermeasures. These information disclosures are typically                          unpaid. When a significant potential financial burden                          is attached, the rewards of providing the needed information                          are dwarfed by potential liabilities.                         Harm 3- Encourages complacency by software providers.                          Prior the DMCA's circumvention provision, companies with                          defective software were compelled by bad publicity to                          release well-tested patches quickly. Evidence provided                          below indicates that at least some companies are abusing                          the DMCA’s anti-circumvention clause to prevent                          their customers from discovering their vulnerability to                          criminals by threatening legal action against those individuals                          who publish this information(2).                         Harm 4- Recent reports from the Bush administration have                          reaffirmed the role rank and file system administrators                          have in securing the nations internet infrastructure against                          assault by terrorist organizations and rouge states. The                          DMCA's circumvention clause in relation to source code                          provides a significant hindrance to protection of the                          internet from hostile attack. System administrators are                          not only highly decentralized, but are scattered throughout                          a wide range of private and public enterprises. Effectively                          disseminating the information necessary to predict and                          prevent large scale assaults on the infrastructure are                          only possible if the information needed to prevent these                          assaults is protected against legal retaliation. Evidence                          that this threat is real is provided by the recent large-scale                          assaults against the DNS root servers in the past month                          (3).                                                  Specific examples cited in this work-                         (1)Descriptions of vulnerabilities discovered in software                          packages utilized in the Red Hat Linux operating system                          are published by foreign researchers in a fashion that                          bars US citizens from accessing this information. The                          researchers explicitly state that their decision to ban                          access by US citizens was motivated by fears of legal                          retaliation in the US under the DMCA’s anti-circumvention                          clause.                         (2)On July 19, 2002 HP sends legal notice to Adriel T.                          Desautels of Secure Network Operations, Inc. that they                          intend to prosecute under the DMCA’s circumvention                          clause unless they make every possible effort to retract                          publication of the security flaws in HP’s True64                          Unix operating System – full text of this letter                          provided below.                         (3)Sophisticated attack against dns root servers - Recently,                          a massive denial of service attack was launched against                          the 'root dns' servers - those computers that provide                          the means to translate word based internet addresses into                          raw IP addresses. The attack was both of exceptionally                          sophisticated and conducted in a manner suggesting of                          a test. The system was attacked for a brief time, then                          the attack was stopped by the attacker before the underlying                          structure of the internet could be significantly degraded.                          Both the unusually high degree of sophistication in the                          attack and the exploratory nature of the attack lend credibility                          to the threat of a future sophisitcated large scale assault                          against critical internet resources on which the economy                          is now dependant.

Example: E-books                        CLASS 2: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that tether the recording to a specific device or platform,                          thereby preventing a lawful possessor from using the work                          on an unsupported system in a non-infringing way.                          Example: Access-Restricted CDs                         CLASS 3: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that tether the work to                          a specific device or platform, thereby preventing a lawful                          possessor from using the work on an unsupported system                          in a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                         CLASS 4: Literary works restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention allows a lawful possessor to                          use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: E-books                         CLASS 5: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention of the technology allows a lawful                          possessor to use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: Copy-restricted CDs                         CLASS 6: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that limit access to and                          post-sale uses of the work, where circumvention of the                          technology allows a lawful possessor to use the work in                          a non-infringing way.

Example: E-books                         Summary:                           When a publisher distributes an E-book tethered to a specific                          device or platform, the DMCA prevents purchasers from                          reading content they lawfully acquire on the devices of                          their choosing. An exemption for this class of works would                          allow purchasers of E-books to lawfully circumvent access                          controls for the lawful purpose of reading a literary                          work on multiple devices or platforms.                          Facts:                          Literary works distributed in electronic format, often                          called E-books, are increasingly restricted by technological                          access controls that prevent owners from reading the book                          on the system they choose. For example, some Adobe E-books                          employ access control measures that prevent users from                          reading an E-book on any machine other than the one it                          was first downloaded onto. This is a problem for E-book                          purchasers who upgrade their computers or switch operating                          systems and are unable to read the E-books they had lawfully                          purchased on their new machine. It is also a problem for                          E-book purchasers who choose to read their E-books on                          a different computer or device, such as a laptop or PDA,                          from the one onto which it was originally downloaded.                         Argument:                          There is a legitimate need for purchasers to be able to                          move their E-books from a desktop to a laptop, from an                          IBM to a Macintosh, or from a Tablet to a PDA. Consumers                          have long exercised the option to read books on planes                          and on trains and in their backyard and in bed. Copyright                          law has never been construed to allow authors to prevent                          a reader's freedom to read a lawfully purchased literary                          work where and how they choose. No less opportunity should                          be available because the reader purchases an electronic                          book. E-books that employ technological restrictions that                          deny someone in lawful possession from accessing it where                          and how and on which device they choose allow content                          creators much greater ability to control reader's choices                          than they have ever had under copyright law.                          Furthermore, tethering literary works to a specific device                          limits an E-book owner's ability to exercise the full                          bundle of property rights long associated with ownership                          of a book. For example, the First Sale doctrine allows                          a reader to resell a book after she has finished it. Access                          controls that restrict the platforms on which an E-book                          can be read interfere with that right. If an E-book is                          tethered to a platform that becomes obsolete, the owner                          can no longer exercise her option to resell or otherwise                          dispose of the Ebook according to her choosing. Since                          the First Sale Privilege is a limitation on a copyright                          holder's ability to control distribution of that work,                          circumvention should be permitted on technological control                          measures that restrict redistribution of an E-book by                          tethering it to a particular device or system.                          Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          E-books to specific devices or platforms is necessary                          to allow purchasers to read and resell literary works                          with the same ease and versatility that they have historically                          exercised. By preventing circumvention of this class of                          access controls, the DMCA both denies purchasers of literary                          works the rights they retained under copyright's historic                          balance and endows creators with new rights to restrict                          how literary works are used in a manner never before contemplated                          or permitted. We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption                          to the DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access                          control measures that tether literary works to specific                          platforms or devices.                         -------------------                         CLASS 2: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that tether the recording to a specific device or platform,                          thereby preventing a lawful possessor from using the work                          on an unsupported system in a non-infringing way.                          Example: Access-Restricted CDs                         Summary:                          The DMCA prevents CD purchasers from listening to recordings                          they lawfully acquire on the devices of their choosing,                          when copyright holders distribute CDs that are tied to                          a specific device or platform. An exemption for this class                          of works would allow purchasers of CDs to lawfully circumvent                          access controls for the lawful purpose of listening to                          their recordings on multiple devices or platforms.                                                Facts:                          Compact Discs (CDs), music downloaded from the Internet,                          and other types of sound recordings are increasingly restricted                          by technological access controls that prevent owners from                          listening to their own recordings on the system they choose.                          For example, some distributors tether sound recordings                          to CD players, preventing lawful possessors from listening                          to the music on a computer (See: ""IBM Updates Copy-Protection                          Software"" by Tom Spring, CNN, April 10, 2002, at                          http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/ 04/10/copyright.software.idg/index.html,                          describing how the latest CD release by pop star Celine                          Dion employed access controls that prevented playback                          on a personal computer, and ""Sony: Downbeat For a                          New Online Music Battle"" by Laura Rohde, CNN, Sept.                          27, 2001 at http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/09/27/sony.music.battle.idg/index.html,                          describing how Sony Music employed access controls to                          certain Michael Jackson CDs that prevented playback on                          computers and CD-ROMs). Other distributors tether sound                          recordings downloaded from the Internet onto the device                          they are originally downloaded (See: ""Music So Nice,                          You Pay Twice"" by Brad King, Wired News, Feb. 4,                          2002 at http://www.wired.com/news/mp3/0,1285,49188,00.html                          describing how Universal Music Group employed access control                          measures on the downloadable recording of ""Fast &                          Furious -- More Music"").                       Argument:                          There are many reasons why consumers want to be able to                          move their sound recordings from their computer to CD                          player, from their CD player to their Diamond Rio, or                          just from their living room to their car. Some users want                          to download music onto a portable MP3 player to listen                          to it while jogging. Others want the ability to wirelessly                          ""beam"" music from one device to another for                          easier or continued use. There is also a cultural heritage                          of making mix-tapes for one's girlfriend, or to listen                          to on road trips. Today, digital technology enables people                          to access their music collection in unprecedented new                          ways. Transportability is one of the chief consumer benefits                          of digital technology, giving consumers the ability to                          ""space-shift"" or ""place-shift"" their                          music from one physical location to another. This versatility                          and portability has historically been part of the rights                          of ownership of a sound recording and copyright law has                          always been construed to empower users to 'rip, mix, burn,                          and create'. Content owners have never been allowed to                          control where and how and in what order a user listens                          to her lawfully owned music. The DMCA changed that by                          preventing circumvention of access control measures that                          tether works to specific devices. To return copyright                          law's traditional balance between creator and users, listeners                          should be permitted to circumvent access controls that                          restrict lawful listening to sound recordings on the users'                          chosen platforms.                         As further evidence of the desirability and support for                          such an exemption, many of these portability fact-patterns                          prevented by the DMCA had previously been found by courts                          to be protected uses. Adopting this class exemption would                          be in line with the many court decisions that have upheld                          space or time-shifting. Most recently, in RIAA v. Diamond                          Multimedia Systems, Inc., 180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir.1999),                          a court held that ""space-shifting"" of sound                          recordings between different devices is considered a lawful                          personal use. Most famously, in Sony Corp. of America                          v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the US                          Supreme Court held that ""time- shifting"" an                          entire copyrighted television show using the VCR constituted                          fair use under the Copyright Act, and thus was a protected                          act.                         Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          CDs to specific devices or platforms is necessary to allow                          purchasers to listen to their music with the same ease                          and versatility that they have historically exercised.                          By preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of music the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with rights to restrict how sound recordings                          are used in a manner never before contemplated or permitted.                          We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the                          DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access                          control measures that tether sound recordings to specific                          platforms or devices.                         --------------------                         CLASS 3: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that tether the work to                          a specific device or platform, thereby preventing a lawful                          possessor from using the work on an unsupported system                          in a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                                                    Summary:                          The DMCA prevents DVD purchasers from watching motion                          pictures they lawfully acquire on the device of their                          choosing, when the movie studios distribute the DVD tethered                          to a specific device or platform. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of DVDs to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of watching                          their motion pictures on multiple devices or platforms.                                                    Facts:                          Motion pictures in Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) format                          are increasingly restricted by technological access controls                          that prevent owners from watching the movie on the platform                          they choose. For example, under the Hollywood movie studios'                          region coding system, consumers cannot play DVDs purchased                          in one region, such as Japan, India, or Europe on machines                          they purchased in another region, such as the United States.                          Also, DVDs can be tethered to a single platform, preventing                          users from playing the same DVD on a computer and a stand-                          alone DVD player, or on a Macintosh and an IBM. The DMCA                          prevents users from circumventing the technology tethering                          a DVD or DVD player to the region where it was purchased                          or tethering a DVD to a designated platform or device.                                                 Argument:                          There are many reasons why consumers may want to play                          DVDs purchased in one region on a device manufactured                          in another region. They could be planning time abroad,                          have been given a gift from an overseas relative, or have                          purchased a souvenir movie of a vacation spot. And there                          are equally as many reasons why consumers might want to                          watch a movie on multiple platforms. They could have different                          DVD player in different rooms of their house, wish to                          upgrade their technology, or want to play a favorite movie                          for their children on a computer on a long plane ride.                          Without a new specific exemption from the Librarian, the                          public will be prevented from accessing their DVDs on                          their own equipment in perfectly lawful and previously                          protected ways.                         The DMCA permitting movie studios to have total control                          over a DVD's use contrasts vividly with copyright's history                          of balancing the interests of publishers, creators, and                          users. First, copyright owners' use of tethering to enforce                          region coding conflicts with 17 U.S.C. Section 602(a),                          which states that consumers do not infringe a copyright                          owner's exclusive rights if they import single copies                          of copyrighted works for personal, noncommercial uses.                          Second, the alienability of copyrighted works is restricted                          because owners are limited in acquiring and disposing                          of works that are not playable on local devices or on                          current device models. Third, innovation is limited because                          movie studios have a de facto legal monopoly over who                          can build DVD players. This unprecedented new power permits                          Hollywood to enforce anti-competitive practices, such                          as requiring a substantial cash bond upfront to build                          a software DVD player, and anti-competitive license terms,                          which by their very conditions, do not permit open source                          software development of DVD playing software. Together                          with the monopoly on who can build DVD players, functionality                          and design restriction choices of major studios prevent                          many lawful uses of a motion picture.                         The practice of tethering DVDs allows copyright owners                          to legally enforce region coding and consequently, price                          discrimination. It also allows copyright owners to increase                          revenues by forcing consumers to purchase multiple copies                          of movies to play on their various platforms, devices                          and operating systems. This interferes with numerous non-infringing                          uses of motion pictures and other audiovisual works distributed                          in digital format. It is particularly troublesome as the                          copyright owners uses the DVD format as its sole means                          for delivering motion pictures to users. DVDs can only                          be accessed on devices or systems authorized and licensed                          by the copyright owners through its licensing entity DVD-CCA.                          This means that the copyright owners can control both                          who makes the devices and what kinds of devices and features                          are available for viewers to watch their lawfully purchased                          movies. By preventing users from circumventing access                          control measures on either DVDs or DVD players, the DMCA                          allows copyright owners an unprecedented amount of control                          over which devices enter the market, how much DVDs and                          players cost, what functions and features are forbidden                          to include on a DVD player, and where and how users watch                          their motion pictures.                                                This is most famously demonstrated by the continued lack                          of any device to watch movies on the Linux operating system.                          Besides stand-alone DVD players, computer software can                          also be written which allows for viewing a DVD on a personal                          computer. Despite Hollywood's years of promises and press                          releases, there is still no licensed DVD player for the                          Linux operating system available for consumer purchase                          (See: ""Corporate Paws Grab for Desktop"" by Brad                          King, Wired News, Sept. 9, 2002 at http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,54941,00.html).                          Because of the DMCA's restriction on circumventing access                          controls, users cannot circumvent the technology tethering                          movies to a Microsoft operating system in order to play                          those movies on a Linux operating system. And they cannot                          purchase content designed for a Linux machine, as the                          copyright owners do not market movies for that platform.                          Thus users of the Linux operating system are de facto                          prevented from viewing their legally obtained movies on                          their computers.                       Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          DVDs to specific devices or platforms is necessary to                          allow purchasers to watch motion pictures with the same                          ease and versatility that they have historically exercised.                          By preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of movies the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with new rights to restrict how movies are used                          in a manner never before contemplated or permitted. We                          urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the DMCA's                          general ban on circumvention of access control measures                          to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access control                          measures that tether motion pictures to specific platforms                          or devices.                         --------------------                          II. Dual Purpose Technology                         CLASS 4: Literary works restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention allows a lawful possessor to                          use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: E-books                         Summary:                          When a publisher distributes an E-book in a format where                          one technology limits access to and limits post-sale uses                          of the book, the DMCA's restriction on circumventing an                          access control technology prevents the user from circumventing                          the post-sale control technology. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of E-books to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of exercising                          the full bundle of their post-sale rights.                                                 Facts:                          Literary works distributed in electronic format, often                          called E-books, are increasingly restricted by technological                          controls that both prevent owners from accessing their                          book and limit owner's post-sale non-infringing use of                          their book. For example, Adobe's E-book access-restriction                          technology allows publishers to disable many post-sale                          lawful uses of the book, such as printing a single page,                          reading the text aloud, or 'space-shifting' an E-book                          to a hand-held device for more convenient reading. Since                          it is often the same technology that restricts access                          to an E-book that also restricts its post-sale use, the                          DMCA's ban on bypassing access controls allows E-book                          publishers to also control the consumer's use of the E-book                          by technology that cannot be lawfully circumvented (See:                          ""Digital Copyright Overkill"" by the Economist,                          Dec. 5, 2002 at http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1482259                          and ""Security Technologies Could Backfire Against                          Consumers"" by Robert Lemos, CNET News, Nov. 7, 2002                          at http://news.com.com/2009-1001-964628.html describing                          how dual-purpose technologies inhibit post-sale uses of                          literary works).                       Argument:                          Ebook readers have a legitimate need to be able to circumvent                          and disable certain post-sale access controls in order                          to exercise the traditional rights of book ownership.                          These post-sale access controls, colloquially termed Digital                          Rights Management Systems (DRMS), allow E-book publishers                          to prevent a wealth of fair uses, including the right                          to print, parody, space shift, sell, and trade the book.                          Together with the rights protected under the DMCA, DRMs                          give E-book publishers unprecedented control over an individual's                          reading experience. The traditional copyright balance                          has tipped dramatically against the consumer and must                          be corrected if readers are to retain their lawful rights                          to use books in the digital realm.                         The exemption is also necessary to satisfy Congress'                          intent in passing the law. In enacting the DMCA, Congress                          specifically intended to permit the circumvention of access                          controls where it was necessary for users to exercise                          fair uses. E-book publishers and technology companies                          are 'circumventing' Congress' clear intent by applying                          dual use technologies to E-books. By doing so, they prevent                          readers from bypassing any of the post-sale use restrictions                          lawfully, because to do so would also mean bypassing the                          access controls which is forbidden by the DMCA.                         Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to read, print, use and resell literary works with the                          same ease and versatility that they have historically                          exercised. By preventing circumvention of this class of                          access controls, the DMCA both denies purchasers of literary                          works the rights they retained under copyright's historic                          balance and endows creators with rights to restrict how                          literary works are used in a manner never before contemplated                          or permitted. We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption                          to the DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of the                          work, where the post sale use is protected under copyright                          law.                         -----------------                         CLASS 5: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention of the technology allows a lawful                          possessor to use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: Copy-restricted CDs                         Summary:                          When a recording company distributes a sound recording                          in a format where one technology limits access to and                          limits post-sale uses of the recording, the DMCA's restriction                          on circumventing an access control technology prevents                          the user from circumventing the post-sale control technology.                          An exemption for this class of works would allow purchasers                          of CDs to lawfully circumvent access controls for the                          lawful purpose of exercising the full bundle of their                          post-sale rights.                          Facts:                          Compact Discs (CDs), music downloaded from the Internet,                          and other types of sound recordings are increasingly restricted                          by technological controls that both prevent owners from                          listening to their music and limit owners' post-sale use                          of their music. Growing numbers of copy-restricted CDs                          are distributed to the public treated with a technology                          that disable consumers ability to copy or otherwise use                          CDs in various lawful ways. If music CDs are only available                          in a restricted format, then individuals will not be able                          to engage in many lawful uses, including fair use of the                          work, whether for review and criticism or for personal,                          noncommercial copying. For example, users' ability to                          copy their music so that they can listen to it on other                          devices is being increasingly restricted by the release                          of CDs protected by access control technologies (See:                          'No more music CDs without copy protection', claims BMG                          Unit', John Lettice.

The Register, November 8, 2002 at http://theregister.co.uk/content/54/28009.hyml,                          describing the types of post-sale access controls that                          are being placed on CDs).                          Argument:                          The DMCA distinguishes between circumventing access controls                          and circumventing copy controls and allows circumvention                          of copy controls in order to engage in fair use. In passing                          the DMCA, Congress clearly intended the public to continue                          to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls on sound                          recordings for lawful purposes. While in theory, consumers                          continue to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls                          to make fair use or to engage in other lawful uses of                          sound recordings, the law still forbids bypassing access                          technology, and since its not possible to bypass copy                          controls without also bypassing access controls with dual                          use technologies, consumers are prevented from exercising                          the right to bypass the copy controls on sound recordings                          in order to make lawful use of their music.                          Copyright holders only have the right to control public                          performances of works under copyright law. But the private                          performance of a work -- the private experiencing of a                          work -- is intended to remain under the control of the                          individual. In total disregard to thiis clear limitation                          of rights, copyright owners are usurping the individual's                          private performance right through the use of technological                          access controls that ""double"" as use controls.                          Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to enjoy their sound recordings with the same ease and                          versatility that they have historically exercised. By                          preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of music the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with rights to restrict how sound recordings                          are used in a manner never before contemplated or permitted.                          We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the                          DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of the                          sound recordings, where the post sale use is protected                          under copyright law.                         ----------------                         CLASS 6: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that limit access to and                          post-sale uses of the work, where circumvention of the                          technology allows a lawful possessor to use the work in                          a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                         Summary:                          When a movie studio distributes a movie in a format where                          one technology limits access to and limits post-sale uses                          of the audiovisual work, the DMCA's restriction on circumventing                          an access control technology prevents the user from circumventing                          the post-sale control technology. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of movies to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of exercising                          the full bundle of their post-sale rights.                                                 Facts:                          Motion pictures distributed in Digital Versatile Disc                          (DVD) format are increasingly restricted by technological                          access controls that both prevent owners from accessing                          their movies and limit owners' post-sale uses of their                          movies. For example, many DVDs are distributed with an                          access control technology called the Content Scrambling                          System (CSS) that also controls post-sale use of the movie                          (See: ""'Tarzan' DVD forces viewers through a jungle                          of previews"" Greg Sandoval, CNET News March 2, 2000                          at                          http://news.search.com/click?sl,news.43.282.1278.0.1.%22                          fast+forward%22+dvds.0,http%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ecom%2Ecom%2F2100%2D1017%2D237585%2Ehtml                          describing how Disney's ""Tarzan"" DVD prevents                          the consumers from fast-forwarding through the DVD's initial                          advertisements).                       Argument:                          The DMCA distinguishes between circumventing access controls                          and circumventing copy controls and permits circumvention                          of copy controls in order to engage in fair use. In passing                          the DMCA, Congress clearly intended the public to continue                          to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls on motion                          pictures for lawful purposes. However, by exploiting the                          DMCA's ban on bypassing technological access controls,                          copyright owners are gaining greater control over the                          post-sale experience and use of a motion picture. This                          is beyond what copyright law grants or that the First                          Amendment permits. By using the same technology to regulate                          access to, and to regulate use of a DVD, the movie studios                          have created the de facto right to control private performances                          where a de jure right never existed.                         Furthermore, by refusing to license the creation of DVD                          players that permit copying or allow other lawful post-sale                          uses, copyright owners are using the DMCA to eliminate                          consumers' control over their own experience of audio-visual                          works. Without the ability to circumvent use controls,                          individuals are forced to experience motion pictures in                          a manner controlled by the movie industry. For example,                          parents who want to fast-forward through age-inappropriate                          movie-previews are prevented from that legitimate activity                          by CSS access controls and consumers are forced to watch                          advertisements, since bypassing the technology that prevents                          fast-forwarding during those ads would be a DMCA violation.                                                 Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to view movies with the same ease and versatility that                          they have historically exercised. By preventing circumvention                          of this class of access controls, the DMCA both denies                          purchasers of movies the rights they retained under copyright's                          historic balance and endows creators with rights to restrict                          how motion pictures and other audiovisual works are used                          in a manner never before contemplated or permitted. We                          urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the DMCA's                          general ban on circumvention of access control measures                          to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of their                          movies, where the post sale use is protected under copyright                          law.

CSS prevents quotation of ancillary                          audiovisual works distributed on DVDs for purposes of                          commentary and criticism, which is a noninfringing use                          under current law. Consideration of the factors enumerated                          in § 1201(a)(1)(C) supports the conclusion that an                          exemption is warranted. An exemption will have no effect                          on the availability for use of copyrighted works: the                          vast number of ancillary audiovisual works are not available                          in unprotected formats; CSS access control on DVDs does                          not support a model beneficial to the public; and, availability                          of ancillary works on DVDs is driven by consumer demand                          and filmmaker enthusiasm. The effect on the availability                          for use of copyrighted works for nonprofit archival, preservation,                          and educational purposes is negative. The impact that                          the prohibition on the circumvention of technological                          measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism                          and comment is highly negative: fair use criticism and                          comment are a core concern of the First Amendment and                          must be granted special solicitude; the DMCA is a criminal                          statute and effects on free speech concerns must be scrutinized                          with particular care; ancillary materials are particularly                          important elements to quote for purposes of comment and                          criticism; the mere possibility of copying without violating                          § 1201(a)(1) is not sufficient to protect strong                          First Amendment rights; and, there is significant harm                          to an amateur reviews website and its contributors. The                          effect of circumvention of technological measures on the                          market for or value of copyrighted works is slightly positive,                          with no negative effects. In the alternative, the Librarian                          of Congress may determine that CSS is not an access control                          device because it does not control access to a work.

A slightly broader way to describe this class: copyrighted                        content for which the copyright holder consents to provide                        *open access*, when ""open access"" is defined as                        access permitting the unrestricted reading, downloading,                        copying, sharing, storing, printing, searching, linking,                        and crawling of some body of work.                         The most important works in this class are scientific                          and scholarly journal articles, at least when the copyright                          is retained by the author or transferred to an open-access                          journal. (When the author's copyright is transferred to                          a traditional journal, the new copyright holder will virtually                          never consent to open access, so we're not talking about                          that case.)                          Scientific and scholarly journal articles are in this                          class because scholarly authors are not paid for journal                          articles and do not expect payment. They are paid by their                          employers and share their research articles freely for                          the sake of advancing knowledge. They write for impact                          and not for money. When they retain copyright, or transfer                          it to an open-access journal, then the copyright holder                          will typically consent to open access. Access-blocking                          DRM would frustrate this intention.                          For the purpose of this rule-making, it shouldn't matter                          whether copyright-holder consent to open access is rare                          or frequent (hence, whether this class is small or large).                          In fact, the class is small but growing larger every day.                          The exemption is needed on the merits and in order to                          give this class a better chance of growing larger.                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary                                            The                          argument: When copyright holders consent to relinquish                          revenue, or consent to open access, then the copyright                          statute should not stand in their way. Copyright holders                          have a right to waive their rights, just as much as they                          have a right to enforce them. When authors sacrifice revenue                          in order to reach a larger audience, or in order to share                          and advance knowledge, then readers ought to get the benefit                          of the author's sacrifice. At the very least, access-blocking                          DRM will thwart, not serve, this class of copyright holders.                         For this class of works, an exceptionless anti-circumvention                          clause threatens readers with criminal penalties for gaining                          the kind of access that the copyright holder desires to                          make available. When authors consent to open access, then                          all use is non-infringing use. Preventing readers from                          taking advantage of this gift from authors not only frustrates                          copyright holders who wish to make this gift, but negates                          their sacrifice in relinquishing revenue, obstructs the                          free exchange of scientific ideas, and impedes research.                                                 For these reasons, most works in this class will be published                          in open-access archives or open-access journals, without                          DRM, and consequently circumvention will never be an issue.                          But the exemption is needed for the occasional works of                          this class for which user access is hindered by DRM barriers.                          Here are some examples:                         1. A scholar makes a point of publishing her research                          in an open-access journal. But several years later, the                          journal is sold to a publisher who changes the business                          model of the journal, and makes back issues accessible                          only to paying customers. The copyright holder's consent                          to provide open access has not changed.                         2. A scholar's work is published online by an open-access                          journal. But that journal is indexed by a search engine                          that also indexes many priced and access-restricted journals.                          Rather than discriminate and give free access to the free                          articles and priced access to the priced articles, it                          charges for full-text access to any article that comes                          up in response to a search.                         3. A government agency decides to outsource its publishing,                          bypassing the GPO and its open-access policies. The private-sector                          publisher makes the (public-domain) papers and other documents                          of the agency available only to paying customers.                          The general principle behind this request for an exemption                          was also asserted in a public statement by France's Académie                          des Sciences on December 6, 2001. The French Académie                          called on the European Commission not to apply ordinary                          copyright rules to scientific publications for which the                          authors seek no payment.                           http://www-mathdoc.ujf-grenoble.fr/DA/                          For more on open access, see the Budapest Open Access                          Initiative. (For example, the BOAI makes clear that many                          authors consenting to open access wish to retain copyright                          rather than put their works into the public domain.)                          http://www.soros.org/openaccess/                                                                                 Comment                                           comment                      text  (2 pages)                                                                                                                                                                        23                                             Don R.

To preserve these works, it is imperative that they                          be migrated to modern storage systems and that the reproductions                          be accessed to verify the accuracy and completeness of                          the transfer. This must be done before the formats or                          media become obsolete or damaged. This use is a non-infringing                          use protected by Sections 107, 108 and 117 of the Copyright                          Act. The proposed exemption is important to preserving                          the availability of the works and enabling archiving,                          future scholarship, and commentary. Furthermore, the proposed                          exemption is narrowly drawn and does not damage the market                          for the works. Without the ability to circumvent access                          controls in order to access archived reproductions, we                          have no way of ensuring this essential non-infringing                          use, and these works will vanish from the historical record                          of the 21st century.

We propose this exemption                        because currently deployed anti-copy technology does not                        support fair use of this class of works intended by Congress.

At present, much research                          of this type is impossible due to the prohibition on acts                          of circumvention in 1201(a)(1). The requested exemption                          would allow this research to proceed.                          The current state of the art in access control technology                          is due in large part to past research on those technologies.                          Yet today’s state of the art does not provide the                          desired level of protection for copyrighted content, so                          future research is needed. Without an exemption for legitimate                          research, much of the needed research will not occur.                          The requested exemption is not limited to encryption research                          but would cover all of the legitimate access control research                          that is being prevented by 1201(a)(1).                          My account of the harms caused by 1201(a)(1) – harms                          that would continue to accrue absent an exemption –                          is based in part on my direct personal experience in performing                          access control research prior to the effective date of                          1201(a)(1), and on my personal plans to resume such research                          should an exemption be granted. My account is also based                          on my general knowledge about my colleagues in the computer                          security research community, and my colleagues in other                          scholarly fields.                          I realize that the Librarian might conclude that it is                          impossible, within the confines of the NOI to grant an                          exemption for legitimate research. The Librarian might,                          for example, reach such a conclusion based on a determination                          that the NOI does not allow the Librarian to create an                          exemption that is narrowly tailored to enable legitimate                          research. If the Librarian does conclude that the NOI                          does not allow an exemption to protect legitimate research,                          I ask the Librarian to state that conclusion clearly,                          so that it is clear that any legitimate-research exception                          to 1201(a)(1) would require Congressional action.

The exemption would apply to “any lawfully                          acquired copy or phonorecord including a copyrighted work                          falling within any category in section 102 that, due to                          its nature and the users who typically use it, is likely                          to be lawfully used in particular environments under the                          fair use doctrine. The exemption shall apply only to such                          users in connection with such fair use” (e.g., the                          exemption would protect a university professor who circumvents                          a lock on a lawfully acquired e-book to use a short excerpt                          in a classroom setting, but would no longer protect the                          professor from suit under section 1201 if the professor                          then posts the (unlocked) e-book on the public Internet).                         3. “Per se Educational Thin Copyright Works”                          – Thin Copyright Works are works that contain limited                          copyrightable subject matter, and which derive significant                          value from material in the public domain, such as facts,                          processes, ideas, or other elements that are beyond the                          scope of copyright protection. To satisfy concerns of                          vagueness, the Copyright Office should recommend a specific                          list of types of works that are subject to the exemption,                          i.e., a “per se” list. The list proposed herein                          is focused on those works most often lawfully used in                          research and education. Thus, this class of exempt works                          consists of “particular subcategories within section                          102 and 103, namely databases, histories, statistical                          reports, abstracts, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and newspapers.”                         4. “Thin Copyright works” – This category                          consists of “works that contain limited copyrightable                          subject matter, and which derive significant value from                          material in the public domain, such as facts, processes,                          ideas, or other elements that are beyond the scope of                          copyright protection.”                         5. “Any work to which the user had lawful initial                          access (i) during the period of lawful access, or (ii)                          after any period of lawful access if the user has physical                          possession of a copy of the work.”                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          The works fall within a category set forth in section                          102, and thus fall within the 2002 NOI’s stated                          preference that section 102 constitute a “starting                          point” for the exempt class. “Per se”                          Educational Fair Use Works, due to their nature and the                          users who typically use them, are highly likely to be                          used in educational environments for fair use purposes                          such as teaching and scholarly research. Thus, application                          of TPMs that prevent access to such works will adversely                          affect the ability of users to engage in such fair use.                          If the Copyright Office is concerned about potential abuses                          of the exemption, a “user and environment”                          restriction could be placed on this “per se”                          list, as described in proposed exemption no. 2.                         2. Contrary to the Librarian’s determination as                          reflected in the 2000 Final Rule, the relevant section                          1201 “classes of works” may be defined with                          reference to the users of such works as well as the type                          of use to which such works are put. The statute, in defining                          the scope of the exemption, expressly references the “persons                          who are users” of the copyrighted work at issue,                          17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(B). Similarly, the statutory                          provision that provides for this rulemaking refers to                          the “users” who are adversely affected in                          their ability to make “noninfringing uses,”                          17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(C), and the provision that                          provides for publication of exempt classes of works refers                          to the “users” to whom the prohibition shall                          not apply. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(D).                           This proposed category of “Fair Use Works”                          does nothing more than permit users to engage in their                          legal right of fair use, unimpeded by access control technologies.                          As Congress expressed throughout the legislative history,                          the triennial rulemaking was specifically meant to permit                          such activity.                         3. Works in the above category most likely derive significant                          value from material in the public domain, such as pure                          facts, or other elements beyond the scope of copyright                          protection, such as ideas. Thus, the application of an                          effective TPM to such works would preclude users from                          obtaining access to elements of a work that are not protected                          by copyright law. While the Librarian noted in the 2000                          Final Rule that such works also include copyrightable                          elements, the use of such elements remain subject to copyright                          law remedies (e.g., infringement suits) notwithstanding                          the proposed exemption. Copyright owners should not be                          able to preclude the public from accessing non-protectible                          features of a “Thin Copyright” work. The scope                          of 1201 was not meant to extend beyond copyrightable features                          of a work, and it is well established that the raw facts                          and ideas in a work may be copied at will. See, e.g.,                          Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499                          U.S. 340, 348, 350 (1991).                         4. Because the “per se” list in exemption                          no. 3 could leave out significant categories of Thin Copyright                          works, this more flexible exemption also should be adopted.                          Although not necessary, a limitation as to the types of                          users (professors, staff, and students) and context of                          use (education and research) could be applied to this                          category.                         5. Congress intended to distinguish between access control                          and use control TPMs. The content community has made clear                          that it intends to use technologies that it classifies                          as “access control” to implement use control,                          effectively eliminating the distinction Congress intended                          to preserve. Recent multi-industry consortia concerned                          with protection of content on CDs (“Secure Digital                          Music Initiative” (SDMI)), DVDs (“DVDCCA Call                          for Proposals” on a watermarking technology), and                          digital broadcast television (“Broadcast Protection                          Discussion Grouop” (BPDG)) confirm the major content                          owners’ goals of end-to-end technological control                          over all uses of their content. The proposed exemption                          no. 5 prevents this result and preserves the rights of                          users to engage in lawful uses of lawfully acquired content.                          The scope of the exemption is appropriate, because the                          exemption does not apply after the initial, lawful access                          unless the user possesses a physical copy (in which case                          the user should be entitled to continue accessing the                          work, while his use thereof will be subject to copyright                          law and, in appropriate cases, license).

Those literary works, musical works and audiovisual works,                        for which a person has lawfully obtained a right of use,                        protected by access control mechanisms which include features,                        flaws or vulnerabilities that (a) expose (i) the works to                        be protected or (ii) other assets of the users of such measures--including                        computers, computers systems or computer networks or the                        data or other protected works used with them--to infringement,                        compromise, loss, destruction, fraud and other adverse actions                        or (b) permit the privacy of such users to be compromised.                         2. Those literary works representing computer software                          programs and databases, for which a person has lawfully                          obtained a right of use, that operate to control access                          to works protected under the Copyright Act but contain                          features, flaws or vulnerabilities that (a) expose (i)                          the works to be protected or (ii) other assets of the                          users of such measures--including computers, computers                          systems or computer networks or the data or other protected                          works used with them--to infringement, compromise, loss,                          destruction, fraud and other adverse actions or (b) permit                          the privacy of such users to be compromised.                          3. Compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked                          by filtering software applications.                         4. Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          Access control mechanisms that fail to provide adequate                          security to the works they are intended to protect are                          also likely to expose the authorized user of a computer,                          computer system, or network to damage or loss, including                          the loss of privacy. The presence of these flawed mechanisms                          exposes other protected works on related computers, computer                          systems, and networks, to unauthorized access. The requested                          exemption permits those with a lawful right of access                          to conduct additional research, scholarship and criticism                          regarding the adequacy of the control mechanisms, as well                          as protected works, within the scope of fair use. Prohibiting                          circumvention relating to the proposed exempt class of                          works is estimated to cost the American economy significant                          amounts per year (although precise cost estimates are,                          for a variety of reasons including underreporting of losses                          and the existence of indirect losses, !                          virtually impossible to ascertain) due to (a) unauthorized                          access through defective control mechanisms, (b) costs                          incurred by consumers and businesses to repair features,                          flaws or vulnerabilities in such control mechanisms and                          (c) lost revenues from users who avoid expenditures on                          protected works and related computer-based expenses out                          of concern for security and privacy risks associated with                          the related access controls. The proposed exemption will                          have no adverse impact upon the owners of the classes                          of works for which the exemption is requested.                         2. Computer software programs and databases that operate                          to control access to works protected under the Copyright                          Act can contain features, flaws or vulnerabilities that                          expose the computers, systems, networks and other assets                          of authorized users to damage or loss, including the loss                          of privacy. In furtherance of the exemptions relating                          to circumvention available under Section 1201(e), 1201(g)                          and 1201(j), the proposed exemption permits authorized                          users to vigorously research, test and verify the functionality                          of the class of works to which the proposed exemption                          relates, and to publish related results and criticisms                          regarding such works, within the scope of fair use. The                          costs of prohibiting circumvention of the proposed exempt                          class of works are enormous. The failure to be able to                          test, and subsequently remediate, security flaws in software                          and databases is estimated to cost the American economy                          significant dollar amounts per year due to (a) unauthorized                          access through de!                          fective control mechanisms, (b) costs incurred by consumers                          and businesses to repair features, flaws or vulnerabilities                          in such control mechanisms and (c) lost revenues from                          users who avoid expenditures on protected works and related                          computer-based expenses out of concern for security and                          privacy risks associated with the related access controls.                          These costs are matched by the continued risks of substantial                          harms not yet realized from future adverse events related                          to the inability to circumvent and test access controls                          protecting the class of work.                         3. The proposed exemption is fully supported by the rationale                          adopted by the Register in the initial exemption rulemaking                          under Section 1201(1)(a)(3). There have been no changes                          in the marketplace or in the related technologies or business                          practices that mitigate against the necessity for continuing                          the exemption.                         4.

Identification of Class 2:                          Sound recordings and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures) embodied in copies and phonorecords, protected                          by access control mechanisms which require the use of                          a computer operating system, media player, codec or digital                          rights management system specified by the copyright holder                          in order to gain lawful access.                          Identification of Class 3:                           Sound recordings and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures) embodied in copies and phonorecords, protected                          by access control mechanisms employed by or at the request                          of the copyright holder which tether the lawfully made                          copies and phonorecords to a particular digital playback                          device.

Identification of Class 5:                          Sound recordings, literary works (including computer programs                          and databases), and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures), protected by access control mechanisms by or                          at the request of the copyright holder which require,                          as a condition precedent to granting access, that the                          user directly or indirectly disclose personally identifiable                          information to the copyright holder other than such information                          as is reasonably necessary to complete a bona fide business                          transaction.                         Identification of Class 6:                          Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                         Identification of Class 7:                          Works embodied in copies or phonorecords that have been                          lawfully acquired by users or their institutions who subsequently                          seek to make noninfringing uses thereof.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            Summary                          of Argument for Class 1 Exemption:                           This proposed class is narrowly crafted to permit lawful                          use of access control technology (hereafter “ACT”)                          to protect exclusive rights or the copyright holder while                          providing a public safety valve in the event a copyright                          holder uses ACT to prevent the access needed to perform                          a work privately, thereby extending copyright-holder control                          beyond the limits of the copyright grant and infringing                          upon lawful (and noninfringing) uses encouraged by the                          Copyright Act.                         The exclusive right to perform a work privately has never                          been granted any copyright owner. It is always a non-infringing                          use. The performance right is specifically limited in                          subsections 106(4) and 106(6) to the exclusive right to                          perform a work “publicly.” As a result, it                          can never constitute copyright infringement to perform                          a work privately. Nevertheless, many copyright owners                          are making the right to perform their works privately                          exclusive to themselves by using ACTs to condition the                          grant of a license to reproduce a work into copies or                          phonorecords on the licensee’s conveyance to the                          copyright holder of control over private performances.                          This conveyance may be carried out in part by a required                          End-User License Agreement (“EULA”) (see proposed                          Class 4) and carried out by the use of ACTs.                          When copyright holders employ ACTs to control lawful                          uses of works – uses that fall outside of the scope                          of the exclusive rights of the copyright holders –                          they are misusing ACTs to expand the scope of their copyrights                          and infringe upon rights reserved to the public. Since                          such use of ACTs does nothing to protect copyrights from                          infringement, but has the sole purpose and effect of capturing                          for the copyright holder a right Congress reserved to                          the public, it would serve the public interest without                          impairing the rights of the copyright holder to permit                          the lawful circumvention of such ACTs for the purpose                          of privately performing these works.                         Summary of Argument for Class 2 Exemption:                          Since the beginning of copyright law, authors have relied                          upon the creativity, ingenuity, business skill, invention,                          and competition of others to disseminate their works to                          the public. Until just recently, authors generally had                          no means to distribute their works to the masses themselves.                          Indeed, copyright law must have been invented precisely                          because reliance upon private contractual terms in which                          the author attempted to maintain privity of contract with                          each person receiving a work was a very poor method of                          promoting science and the useful arts, or even serving                          the author’s economic interests. Copyright law lifted                          the “business” burden from authors, and provided                          for a careful balance of public rights that served authors                          as a means of serving the public.                          Thus, even as major companies amassed large copyright                          holdings, it has long been the case that they relied upon                          delivery systems owned or controlled by others. Book publishers                          profited most by not trying to also be printers, paper                          mills or bookstores, music publishers profited most by                          not having to become (or control) vinyl record or record                          player manufacturers, radio and television broadcasters                          relied upon radio and television manufacturers, and so                          on. Today, that trend continues, even as the digital dissemination                          of copyrighted works relies upon ever more complex systems,                          including electronic devices (computers, routers, servers,                          drives, sound cards, speakers) and computer software (media                          players, codecs and security software).                         This system of keeping the exclusive rights of copyright                          holders within strict limits has served us well. There                          is absolutely no “copyright interest” to be                          advanced by permitting copyright holders to leverage their                          lawful copyright monopolies into dictating which computer                          operating systems, media players, codecs or digital rights                          management systems must be used by those exercising licensed                          exclusive rights of reproduction or public performance                          or, worse, by those exercising rights that have never                          belonged to the copyright holder, such as the right to                          perform a work privately.                          Recognizing this, our judiciary has produced a long line                          of cases condemning the use of one copyright to bolster                          the value of other material, copyrighted or not. Provision                          of an exemption is a necessary corollary to respect for                          the limits upon the copyright established by Congress.                          Allowing competition in the development of competing technologies                          used in the dissemination of copyrighted works serves,                          rather than hinders, the public interest in copyright                          law. Allowing such competition in no way impairs the exclusive                          rights of copyright holders. Suppression of such competition,                          in contrast, can serve no public interest. Accordingly,                          where copyright holders seek to use technological devices                          to enlarge their limited rights into control over broader                          non-exclusive areas of public and private discourse, over                          technology, over various distribution systems, over media                          channels, and over the Internet itself, the public must                          have at its disposal the freedom to use its own technological                          devices to break free.                         Summary of Argument for Class 3 Exemption:                           Copyright holders are increasingly employing technological                          devices to deny access to works which, once lawfully made,                          are attempted to be played on devices other than the one                          to which the copyright holder has “tethered”                          the copy or phonorecord. As in the case of proposed Classes                          1 and 2, such tethering does nothing to advance any legitimate                          interest of the copyright holder. More importantly, tethering                          serves to deny downstream users the ability to access                          the works, completely voids application of the first sale                          doctrine and the operation of Section 109 of the Copyright                          Act, destroys all lawful trade and commerce competing                          sales, rentals, lending and gifts that might compete with                          “original” access in a monetized transaction                          benefiting the copyright holder, and denies access to                          copyrighted works to those millions of Americans who,                          due to lack will or means to pay full price for a “new”                          reproduction, rely upon the used market, public libraries,                          private lending and gift economies to satisfy their thirst                          for learning, art and entertainment.                         Summary of Argument for Class 4 Exemption:                          With increasing frequency, copyright holders are using                          ACTs to require assent to EULAs as a condition precedent                          to gaining access to copyrighted works. Some EULAs can                          have public and private benefits if they spell out rights                          of the copyright holder that are being licensed (or not)                          to the end user. Others, however, require users to agree                          to give the copyright holder additional rights denied                          to them in the Copyright Act.                          In some cases, the copyright holder may use the ACT to                          require the user to give the copyright holder control                          over noninfringing uses that fall entirely beyond the                          scope of the copyright. Such would be the case of EULAs                          giving the copyright holder control over non-exclusive                          rights such as nonpublic performances of a work, for example.                          In other cases, the ACT will be used to require assent                          to waiving limitations placed upon the copyrights, such                          as the limitations in sections 107-122 to which all section                          106 rights are subject. An ACT used to require assent                          to terms preventing the lawful redistribution (meaning                          redistribution of physical objects) of lawfully made copies                          and phonorecords would be but one example.                          When the purpose and effect of an ACT is to enlarge the                          scope of the copyright beyond the limits imposed by Congress,                          the EULAs themselves should be void as against public                          policy. Naturally, any use of ACTs to require assent to                          such EULAs should be considered copyright misuse. It would                          serve the public interest without harming any rights of                          the copyright holder to permit circumvention of ACTs used                          by copyright holders to leverage the licensing of lawful                          rights into assent to copyright-enlarging EULAs.                          Summary of Argument for Class 5 Exemption:                          The courts have already recognized the application of                          the First Amendment to the protection of anonymous speech.                          Congress has further extended such protection to the private                          sector by prohibiting private disclosure of personally                          identifiable information concerning users of audiovisual                          works, literary works and other materials used by library                          patrons. This proposed class furthers the dual objectives                          of the Copyright Clause of the Constitution and the First                          Amendment to the Constitution by allowing users of copyrighted                          works to circumvent efforts by copyright holders to require                          that they disclose personally identifiable information                          as a condition precedent to obtaining access.                         Just to be clear what this class does not do, this exemption                          would not invalidate a requirement that persons seeking                          access disclose personally identifiable information where                          necessary to complete a bona fide business transaction,                          such as in the provision of credit card information or                          account-holder information for payment. Rather, this exemption                          would only mean that everyday actions such as preventing                          a DRM from reporting to the copyright holder the identity                          of the user of a lawful reproduction as part of separate                          data-mining activities of the copyright holder would not                          be actionable as a violation of Section 1201(a).                          Summary of Argument for Class 6 Exemption:                          This exemption is identical to an exemption currently                          in effect, 37 C.F.R. § 201.40(b)(2). Because there                          are already market examples of such malfunction, damage                          or obsolescence that prevent noninfringing use for which                          the product was intended, this exemption should be extended                          for another term.                          Summary of Argument for Class 7 Exemption:                          This proposed class follows the proposal of the National                          Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”)                          in its September 29, 2000 letter to the Register of Copyrights.                          As the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information                          explained at the time on page 4 of the letter, “this                          construction is appropriate because the definition of                          classes of works [in Section 1201(a)(1)(B)] is not bounded                          by limitations imposed by Section 102(a) of the Copyright                          Act, but incorporates an examination of ‘noninfringing                          uses’ of the copyrighted materials.”                          The greatest appeal of this Class 7 is its simplicity                          (making it easy for the average citizen to understand),                          its comprehensiveness (covering all noninfringing uses),                          its furtherance of the pubic interest (by encouraging                          unfettered use of lawfully acquired content), and its                          incentive for copyright holders to facilitate lawful uses                          rather than to impede them (by discouraging copyright                          holders or their licensees from using access control technologies                          to infringe upon the public’s rights).                          A major substantive difference in Class 7 as previously                          proposed by the NTIA from the other classes proposed herein                          is that this exemption would apply without regard to whether                          the ACT was imposed by or at the request of the copyright                          holder. The other proposed classes would not create an                          exemption for competitive business models offered independent                          of the copyright holder and which do not unlawfully extend                          the scope of the copyright holder’s copyright monopoly                          through use of ACTs.

Such evidence has played an important role                          in                          litigation such as the _Mainstream Loudoun v. Loudoun                          County Library_ library censorware case, or the Children's                          Internet Protection Act (CIPA) case. Studies of censorware                          blacklists are vastly hindered by not being able to access                          those blacklists. In particular, studying structural,                          architectural issues, such as ""loophole"" sites,                          requires                          access to the decrypted blacklist.

Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                         3. Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that are at high                          risk of failure in the near-term future because of malfunction,                          damage or obsoleteness. In order to invoke this case,                          the potential malfunction, damage, and/or failure must                          not be due intentional damage meant to invoke this clause.                         4.

Literary works (including computer software and databases),                          musical works, and motion picture works which are region                          encoded, and for which the nearly identical product except                          for being keyed for a region containing the United States                          does not exist for mass-market consumption within the                          United States.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          Previously, the Librarian of Congress decided to exempt                          this class of works from the access provisions of the                          Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Research done                          under this exemption has resulted in a number of findings,                          many of which are of interest to the general public. It                          is therefore requested that this class be considered for                          renewal.                         2. The Librarian of Congress previously decided to exempt                          ""literary works, including computer programs and                          databases, protected by access control mechanisms that                          fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage or                          obsoleteness"" from the access provisions of the Digital                          Millennium Copyright Act's access previsions for the current                          exemption period. And just like the previous period, literary                          works are still subject to malfunction, damage, or obsoleteness.                          It is therefore requested that this class be considered                          for renewal.                         3. The Librarian of Congress previously decided to exempt                          ""literary works, including computer programs and                          databases, protected by access control mechanisms that                          fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage or                          obsoleteness"" from the access provisions of the Digital                          Millennium Copyright Act's access previsions for the current                          exemption period. But during my personal reading of the                          Library's explanations, I did not notice any discussion                          on how to handle works that are likely to fail in the                          near-term future.                          It is therefore requested that the Librarian of Congress                          either renew the previous exemption case with an additional                          clause permitting, or to add an additional allowed case                          to allow recovery of works likely to fail in the near                          term future, when such failure is not intentionally aggravated                          to invoke this clause.                         4. Sometimes, access control mechanisms only allow a                          user indirect access to a work. A literary work may be                          sealed away in a vault, stored on a medium sealed inside                          another, accessed only indirectly via an interpreter,                          etc.                           Such situations often leave the work's owner/licensor                          no clue as to the health of the literary work itself.                          It is therefore critical that a user be able to access                          a work itself as well as its storage medium in order to                          determine its status. This case is meant to compliment                          case #3.                          5. This case was contained within case #2 as a permissible                          reason to bypass an access control for the current period.                          But the fact that this was allowed was only made clear                          by the Library's comments. When a copyright holder, company,                          or other party in charge of maintaining an access control                          fails to support users of said access control means, the                          access control technically has not malfunctioned, been                          damaged, or become obsolete; rather, the access control                          provider is just being stubborn.                          It is therefore requested that the Librarian of Congress                          renew case #2 as before, but also clarify it by adding                          this case. Since the final report in response to the previous                          comment period covered this contingency, adding this case                          (assuming case #2 is renewed) should be a trivial matter.                         6. Previously, the Librarian of Congress decided that                          this class of works did not qualify for an exemption.                          However, the Librarian did admit that this situation will                          have to be revisited should the situation change.                          Since the time of the previous rulemaking, a number                          of factors have occurred that changed the situation. Major                          retailers have announced they are discontinuing and/or                          decreasing sales of non-region encoded products offerings                          in favor of region encoded ones. General sales estimates                          have shown sales of some of these to exceed those of the                          non-region encoded forms, with the likelihood of the variety                          of certain non-region encoded items to be shortly cut                          back and/or discontinued.                          Region coded works, while providing the copyright holder                          with some benefits, also provide the consumer with significant                          drawbacks. Only ""mass marketable"" items tend                          to be sold in any given market, restricting those whose                          tastes do not match the average person’s. Prior                          to the DMCA, those with different tastes from the mainstream                          were able to import works from other countries. Region                          coding, combined with other existing legislation, prohibits                          this in many cases.                          An argument was made during the previous comment round                          that people wishing to use foreign works that contained                          region-code access controls could simply purchase products                          capable of playing them. But given these products are                          typically sold in foreign markets, they may not meet U.S.                          standards for import and/or sale. Products that can handle                          works from multiple regions often limit the number of                          times they can switch between regions, severely hampering                          owners of multi-region collections of works. Furthermore,                          the cost to purchase all the necessary support equipment                          can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of importing                          the work itself, when there is no difference in storage                          formats other than that due to the region access code.

II. Technological measures designed to control access                          to and use of eBooks and other literary works in electronic                          media are currently being implemented in a manner which                          fails to permit access by individuals with visual or print                          disabilities who utilize ""screen readers"" or                          similar text-to-speech or text-to-braille devices as aids                          to perception. Fewer than 10% of books published in the                          United States are ever made available to such individuals                          in accessible formats (such as braille or ""talking                          books"") that are not subject to access controls.                          Moreover, the availability of works in such formats is                          typically delayed until months after a work is first released                          to the general public.

Historically, book publishers                          relied upon printers and paper mills, player piano roll                          manufacturers relied upon player piano manufacturers,                          vinyl record manufacturers relied upon record player manufacturers,                          radio and television broadcasters relied upon radio and                          television manufacturers, and so on. This paradigm persists                          today as the digital dissemination of copyrighted works                          relies upon increasingly complex systems, including electronic                          hardware (computers, routers, servers, drives, video and                          sound cards, monitors, speakers) and computer software                          (operating systems, browsers, media players, codecs and                          security software).                         However, the goals of copyright are not advanced when                          copyright holders are permitted to leverage their lawful                          copyright monopolies into control over which computer                          operating systems, browsers, media players, codecs or                          digital rights management systems must be used by those                          exercising licensed exclusive rights of reproduction or                          public performance or, worse, by those exercising rights                          that have never belonged to the copyright holder, such                          as the right to perform a work privately.                         American jurisprudence is replete with cases condemning                          the use of copyright to leverage market power in related                          or adjacent markets for other products or services, copyrighted                          or not. Although the question whether prosecutors or private                          parties may obtain relief from such abusive practices                          is not before us, provision of an exemption is a necessary                          corollary to respect for the limits upon the copyright                          established by Congress and reaffirmed in the courts.                          Allowing competition in the development of competing technologies                          used in the dissemination or use of copyrighted works                          serves, rather than hinders, the public interest in copyright                          law. Allowing such competition in no way impairs the exclusive                          rights of copyright holders and inherently benefits consumers                          and innovation.

Class #2 (DVD Region Coding): Audiovisual works stored on                        Digital Versatile Disks (“DVDs”) that are not                        available in Region 1 DVD format and access to which is                        prevented by technological measures.                        Class #3 (Unskippable DVD Advertising): Audiovisual works                        released on DVD that contain access control measures that                        interfere with the ability to control private performance,                        including the ability to skip promotional materials.                        Class #4 (Public Domain Film on DVD): Audiovisual works                        that are in the public domain in the United States and that                        are released solely on DVDs, access to which is prevented                        by technological protection measures.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            “Copy-protected”                          CDs are intended to prevent the unauthorized reproduction                          of sound recordings. Unfortunately, the technological                          protection measures involved can malfunction so as to                          make the copy-protected CDs unplayable in certain playback                          equipment. A consumer should be entitled to take steps                          to restore the playability of such a CD. To the extent                          this activity may constitute a violation of Section 1201(a)(1),                          consumers should be exempted from liability.                         DVDs are region coded, so they can only be played on                          a DVD player coded to the same region as the DVD. A substantial                          and growing number of Americans wish to view foreign DVDs                          that are not available in Region 1 versions. An exemption                          is required to allow these consumers to modify their DVD                          players to view their legitimately obtained foreign DVDs.                         Movie studios are able to make certain DVD content “unskippable”                          during playback. Some studios have abused this feature                          by preventing the skipping of advertising shown prior                          to the start of the feature presentation. DVD owners should                          be entitled to eliminate these mandatory ads, or, in the                          alternative, defeat the “UOP blocking” feature,                          and should enjoy an exemption from DMCA liability when                          they do so.                         Public domain works are increasingly being released or                          re-released only on CSS-protected DVDs, which preclude                          consumer access to, and use of, these works for a range                          of non-infringing purposes. To the extent that the Librarian                          considers that public domain works which are stored on                          CSS-protected DVDs fall within the prohibition in Section                          1201(a), an exemption to circumvent CSS is required for                          consumers to access and use these public domain works.

The exemption requested is to permit circumvention of                          the region coding mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            Audiovisual                          works on DVD video discs currently are released with a                          ""regional locking"" mechanism that prevents discs                          manufactured in one part of the world from being played                          on DVD players or DVD-ROM drives sold in other parts of                          the world. This region coding functions as an access control                          as per subsection 1201(a)(1)(A). We argue that this access                          control causes substantial adverse impact on devotees                          and students of foreign cultures or languages since a                          significant quantity of foreign audiovisual material is                          available for purchase only on DVDs coded for use outside                          the United States. Specific markets are discussed and                          examples offered. Such individuals are forced to spend                          hundreds of dollars on specialized yet essentially redundant                          equipment in order to view the material they have purchased.                          The remedy proposed is to allow such individuals to circumvent                          the region locking mechanism on their DVD playback device                          for the purpose of noninfringing viewing of materials                          in the exempted class.                         The Library's reasons for rejecting such an exemption                          in 2000 are reexamined in light of marketplaces changes.

TITLE 17: CHAPTER 1: Sec. 117(a)(1) of the US Code.                          This section properly covers the essential processes of                          utilizing programs on computers (complex electronic devices                          that arguably anything with microprocessors [most playback                          devices and appliances] would have such status).                          Why is the DMCA circumventing the law on copyright? Playing                          audio involves this exact process of decoding (and copying                          the data to a buffer) prior to directing the audio to                          its output (usually speakers). The copyright law allows                          for this essential need. While it would be better to have                          this section of the DMCA repealed, the only other logical                          choice is make audio information exempt.                         TITLE 17: CHAPTER 1: Sec. 107(4) of the US Code.                          The fair use clause allows for reproduction of a work                          under certain conditions. Subsection 4 is arguably the                          most important as it requires the consideration of the                          effect of this copy on the value of the work.                         If the work was properly purchased, what possible negative                          effect is placed on the work by allowing the purchaser                          to play this same recording on the player of his/her choosing                          for the sole purpose of his/her private use? The answer                          is it has no negative effect... even if the listener has                          to copy it from the original recording to the audio playing                          device (like an ipod).                         I am not arguing that music should be free, that there                          shouldn't be copyrights or anything of the like. I am                          arguing that the rights of the purchaser are being removed                          by my government! If I chose not to buy records from some                          draconian and bullying entertainment conglomerate, a small                          company could grow and fill the niche of leaving me with                          the rights due a legitimate customer. However, this is                          no longer possible since I am subject to the DMCA even                          if company concerned with my rights and preserving my                          freedoms is selling me a recording.                         Imagine for a moment that you lose all rights related                          to recordings. You have to play it on a specific player.                          The player licensed to decode it might be sold only by                          the recording vendor or perhaps it is only sold through                          one computer software company. It would be illegal to                          play the recording on a player or the PC I own, I'd have                          to get a different one. THAT is ridiculous. If you think                          this isn't going to happen, you are mistaken. This law                          is written such that the player can be dictated to the                          consumer as it is the only method allowed to decode the                          work. Legally the consumer won't be able to use a different                          player and manufacturers of alternative players will likely                          get sued for circumvention of the ""protections""                          put in place.                         The only way to preserve fair use is to support the exemption                          of all media from the DMCA bill which tries to supersede                          other, better written, laws like those of copyright law.

For example,                          if I buy a compact disc, it should be within my rights                          to make a copy for my cassette player, my .mp3 player,                          or any other format for which I own the hardware.

The section interferes with many legal, non-infringing                          uses of digital computing and prevents scientists and                          technologists from circumventing access technologies in                          order to recognize shortcomings in security systems, to                          defend patents and copyrights, to discover and fix dangerous                          bugs in code, or to conduct forms of desired educational                          activities.

Making such ephemeral recordings                          to computer servers is necessary for most Internet webcasting.                          As Congress recognized in enacting the section 112(a)                          exemption to liability for circumvention for the purpose                          of making of a single ephemeral recording, the circumvention                          capability requested by DiMA implicates section 1201(a)(1).                          An exemption therefore is justified for the narrow purposes                          of making permitted multiple ephemeral recordings, so                          as to facilitate Internet webcasting.                         Factual and legal support for this exemption is set forth                          in the attached document.

I would like to give an example of copying for personal                              use and a few common ways that this private is implemented                              that I feel should be protected:                              The copying: Making copies of digitalized works for                              archival and backup purposes.                              Often the medium upon which digitalized products are                              shipped is of low quality, regular use of the medium                              often leads to deterioration of the medium making                              it either unusable or making the use of the product                              less enjoyable than was planned. By archiving the                              product, the information therein can be used/enjoyed                              without the risk of further damage to the original                              medium. It is common knowledge the well-cared for                              LP's last much longer than music CD's.                              Personal use over home-networks: According to the                              DMCA it would be illegal to make copies of the protected                              works no matter what the intended use. If I want to                              enjoy a music file, that is protected, through my                              PC, by following the DMCA I would habe to block my                              CD-ROM to use the file. If I could archive the files,                              I would still have access to all of the functions                              that the PC allows, and be able to enjoy the music/film                              etc.                               I am a US citizen an registered voter currently living                              in Germany, this does not relieve me from my responsibility                              to voice my concerns when I feel thta the rights of                              US citizens are being infringed upon.

Heard                          of them? Probably not. They are all (very) local Maine                          artists that I have played on my radio shows on our 110-watt                          college music station. The artists get little-to-no exposure                          beyond our college station's broadcasts. They can potentially                          benefit immensely from a wider (internet) audience. Please                          consider an exemption for college radio stations. The                          artists benefit. The ""harm"" is the denial of                          an expanded exposure for these struggling artists and                          the loss (by the potential listeners) who will never get                          to hear these artists.

As a self published, distributed, and promoted musician,                        I can personally attest that such outlets are vital in reaching                        an audience. The consolidation and dwindling competion of                        the broadcasting and publishing industries has made it very                        difficult for small artists to gain exposure. Already, a                        number of small/amateur broadcast outlets have been forced                        to close as a result of the royalty rates set recently.                        Some of our friends in the music industry have thereby lost                        their only broadcast connection to their audience, and thus                        have lost the only significant marketing tool available                        to them. Small broadcast outlets must be permitted to thrive                        economically for the independent music community to thrive                        as well.

Digital media commonly used to distribute motion pictures                          and other audiovisual works have a finite lifespan. There                          is yet no experience that the lifespan of digital media                          equals or exceeds the lifespan of familiar analog media                          used for analog motion pictures and other audiovisual                          works.

GX271-39-0000000	"Kenai Community Library TECHNOLOGY PLAN 2000-2003 VISION STATEMENT The Kenai Community Library endeavors to provide resources and services that will meet the ongoing information needs of the residents of the City of Kenai and the surrounding area within the Kenai Peninsula Borough. Access to current information technology is an essential element to carrying out this mission. High-speed Internet access and other information technologies has become a necessity for the staff to adequately perform traditional library tasks such as book acquisition, cataloging, interlibrary loan and reference services. These technologies now include an electronic magnifier for the visually impaired, fax and telephone service, CD-ROMs, a microfiche/microfilm reader printer, a photocopier, automated library catalog and circulation system, a dial-up link for at-home users and full Internet access. The Kenai Community Library is a small Alaskan library funded by the City of Kenai that offers free access to all of its resources. Additional and improved electronic resources will enable the library and its users to gain information from a variety of sources available regionally, nationally, or globally. The Internet, with its resources, proves to be an invaluable tool for Alaskan residents who, by their geographical location, might otherwise be isolated from educational opportunities. Patrons can employ these emerging technologies to assist them with their personal growth and prepare them for employment opportunities. Through the use of additional information technology, the Kenai Community Library will be able to offer access to resources otherwise beyond its financial means and its space constraints. Participation in the Universal Service Fund discount program will mean that the library will be able to continue to offer these and additional services well into the next century.   163 Main Street Loop Kenai, AK 99611-7723 Library Director- Ewa Jankowska  GOAL 1  IMPROVE ACCESS TO LIBRARY COLLECTIONS Objective: Make Library's catalog available through the Internet FY 2000-2001 Purchase Windows NT server and other hardware components from Ameritech Purchase graphic Dynix WebPAC software Send two staff members for Dynix WebPAC training Redesign the Library web page that would serve as a gateway to the catalog FY 2001-2002 Replace all text-based terminals with PCs Add printers Create databases mounted with the catalog  such as community information, bestsellers lists, specialized bibliographies, etc. FY 2002-2003 Review the existing online catalog  upgrade to the newer version and/or consider a different vendor GOAL 2  IMPROVE AND PROMOTE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE SERVICES Objective: Improve the existing telephone system FY 2000-2001 Replace the existing system with Norstar Compact ICS LS/DSS and standard software Replace the existing telephones Install one cordless phone at the circulation desk Add one jack and wire Install an answering machine FY 2001-2002 Add a cellular phone to communicate with remote storage Objective: Enhance access to electronic reference sources FY 2000-2001 Redesign Library web pages;

Internet access shall be made reasonable, fair, and equitable to all users. 2. Internet communications shall be considered private and confidentiality will be encouraged within the limits of a public environment, the technology of the equipment, and the requirements of law. 3. Violations of library guidelines and engaging in certain prohibited practices in Internet use may lead to the suspension or revocation of Internet access through the Library. Guidelines for Responsible Use It is expected that the user of the Internet: 1. Shall make only authorized access to systems, netware, software, and databases for educational, informational, and recreational purposes only. 2 . Shall avoid the sending, receiving, and displaying of text or graphics that may be reasonably construed as sexually explicit or offensive. A written definition of what constitutes ""sexually explicit"" material is available at the front desk. 3. Shall obey the law and regulations in their application to copyright, licensed software and data. 4. Shall be aware that violations of these guidelines for responsible use may lead to the suspension or revocation of your Internet access within the Library.  Statement of Responsibility 8   163 Main Street Loop Kenai, AK 99611-7723 Library Director- Ewa Jankowska The Internet with its highly diverse and often controversial content is an unregulated resource and can be used only at your own risk. Beyond its home pages, Kenai Community Library cannot control the information found on the Internet and is not responsible for its accuracy, correctness nor its suitability.  * A Special Note to Parents Internet's ""user friendliness"" and intrinsic flexibility to access a wide range of well known and many lesser known information resources demands diligent and thoughtful parental supervision. It should be understood that the Kenai Community Library cannot act as a censor nor substitute parent. It is the responsibility of the parent to provide the oversight to ensure their children's use of the Internet in an appropriate and safe manner. Internet Offerings and Limitations 1. Library access to the Internet is available at work stations that use software designed to browse the World Wide Web (WWW). Dial in access is not available through the library. 2. You will need a current Kenai Community Library card in order to check in for computer use. You may use the computer one time per day, up to one hour. 3. You may not use your own software programs on the library computers. This will help prevent computer viruses that are common on public computers. 4. Bring your own used disk, formatted for an IBM PC compatible, if you wish to save files. There is a system printer for printing at $.25 per page. 5. Misuse of the computer or Internet access will result in loss of your computer privileges. 6. Because of library scheduling, Internet-trained staff may not always be available.

Introduction             The Free Library of Philadelphia provides access to information in              all formats, including electronic formats. Electronic resources are              defined in this document as materials which are accessed through computers,              terminals, or computer networks as well as the equipment itself.             This document is designed to provide instruction to staff and public              regarding the resources available, and the proper use of those resources              within the Free Library system in a manner consistent with existing              policies. The Librarys  Policy on Electronic Resources              and the Internet  will be issued as a separate document.             II. Electronic Resources                            A. Workstations               Under the supervision of the administrative staff, Library agencies                are responsible for:                               establishing and enforcing computer use schedules, including                  posting of time limits, implementing a sign-up process (in-person,                  telephone, etc.), and maintenance of user waiting lists.                  designating computers to be reserved for those using the Librarys                  electronic resources, and computers for those using the computers                  for recreational activities (unstructured Internet searching,                  etc.). These responsibilities include clearly indicating the uses                  for which the computers are assigned, and maintaining separate                  sign-up sheets.                  providing access to workstations without restrictions based                  on the age of the user.                 implementing Library policies on printing and fees for service.                 scheduling workstations for special programs, such as school                  visits, or programs.                             Computer users are not required to have a library card in order                to use the Librarys electronic resources within Library agencies.                The use of the Librarys resources from other locations, however,                may require that the user have a library card. Agency staff may                encourage computer users to register for a library card so that                they can take full advantage of all of the Librarys services.                Some Library agencies have received private funding for the establishment                of technology labs for the technical training of the public. While                these extensions of service are valued by staff and public, they                tax the resources available for technical support. The Library cannot,                therefore, continue to accept projects which would expand these                services beyond current commitments. Staff are  not  to encourage                the general public, or potential donors regarding gifts of this                kind.               B. Electronic Materials               The Librarys electronic materials collection includes, but is                not limited to CD-ROMs, diskettes, online search services, Internet-based                databases, the Librarys public access catalog, the Librarys Web                site, and World Wide Web sites linked from the Librarys Web site                or catalog. These materials are designed to serve the same basic                purpose as other Library materials; that is, to ""be guided                by the principle that the Library is an educational force, an intellectual                and cultural center, and a catalyst for economic and community development.""                 (Materials Selection Policy, PS #56, p.1)               Electronic materials are developing rapidly in both their content,                and the options for delivery to users. In selecting materials, the                quality of the content  its accuracy, authoritativeness, completeness,                currency and uniqueness, the relevance to the entire collection,                and the ease of use will be considered of primary importance.               Electronic materials are made available with the following provisions:                               All electronic materials provided to both the public and the                  staff are subject to copyright restrictions.                 All electronic materials are provided according to agreements                  with the materials producers/vendors. The terms of these agreements                  must be adhered to by both staff and public, and will be posted                  as necessary.                 If an electronic resource requires verification of the users                  right to access it from computers outside the Library system (authentication),                  the Library will determine the formula, method, and procedure                  for issuing such authentication. User authentication is not transferable.                 No software installed on Library computers may be copied without                  authorization by Information Technology Division. No software                  installed on Library computers may be copied for use on a non-Library                  computer.                 No software may be installed on, or downloaded to Library hardware                  without authorization by Information Technology Division. Software                  includes, but is not limited to, computer programs, helper applications,                  and CD-ROM-based products.                 No changes may be made by staff or public to any Library software                  that has been installed on Library equipment without authorization                  by Information Technology Division.                             All user requests for specific electronic materials will be reported                to the Collection Development Office through the Materials Request                Form currently in use.               At this time, no software is circulated to the public. Some print                materials are produced and packaged with diskettes and/or CD-ROMs.                These materials are circulated as books with inserts.               C. Internet               The Free Library seeks to balance the users free access to information                with the Librarys mission, and with the concerns and needs of other                users. The Free Library assumes responsibility for information contained                in its Web site. Electronic databases, and sites which are linked                to these pages and/or cataloged by Library staff, become part of                the Librarys collection and meet the selection criteria listed                in the Librarys Materials Selection Policy. Other Internet sites,                even though they may be accessible, have not been evaluated by Library                staff. Internet users are responsible for the particular points                they reach.               The structure of the Internet, and the nature of an open-access                computing environment allow users to access some sites which are                problematic for the following reasons:                               Internet sites may not provide reliable, accurate, complete,                  and up-to-date information.                 Internet sites change rapidly and may not be available, or access                  may be very slow at certain times.                 Internet users may access sites which provide information and                  images which fall outside the scope of the Librarys mission,                  and which may be inappropriate for viewing in a public library                  setting.                 Children who use the Internet may need monitoring, and guidance                  from parents or caregivers. The Library will support parents and                  caregivers in understanding the Internet, and how their children                  can use it safely.                             The Library does not, at this time, limit access to the Internet.                The Library will, however, continue to pursue technical capabilities                to provide parents and caregivers with an option for restricting                access for their children.               Communication through the Internet               Although access to means of communication through the Internet                is available, it is not guaranteed.               Electronic Mail               Access to and use of electronic mail on the Internet is growing.                Although the Library does not support use of email for interpersonal                communication, computer users make significant use of it. Staff                may assist computer users with accessing and using personal email.                If email is being used as part of a school assignment, or as an                option for forwarding data retrieved from electronic resources,                staff should assist users in accessing and using it. Staff will                also assist users, and provide access to computers if use of email                is part of a Library-sponsored or Library-supported program.               Chat Rooms               The Library does not encourage, or support the use of chat rooms                by computer users unless they are part of a Library-sponsored or                Library-supported program. Library staff will ask users to close                out chat rooms if they are violating ""Library Standards of                Acceptable Behavior."" Staff may actively discourage unattended                children from using chat rooms.                         III. Staff Use of Electronic Resources                            A.  Technical Training for Staff               Training of staff is essential to the performance of their duties                in providing access to electronic resources, and assistance to the                public. Information Technology Division is responsible for all technical                training within the Free Library. Public Service Division staff                is responsible for training on the content of electronic materials.                Priorities for technical training of staff are based on the staff                members need for training in tasks required to perform the duties                of their current positions, not their inclinations or interests.                Information Technology, in consultation with Public Service, is                responsible for insuring that all staff members receive the technical                training needed to perform their jobs.               B. Staff Instruction of the Public               Library staff will provide a similar level of instruction and assistance                with electronic resources as they provide with other resources.                All Public Service librarians and library assistants are expected                to be able to perform the following tasks on a routine basis:                               use workstation keyboards                 enter and exit programs and databases                 load and change diskettes                 use documentation, print and electronic                 operate the printer                 refer users to appropriate staff for help in formulating searches                 report and follow up on hardware and software problems                             All Public Service librarians are expected to be able to perform                the following tasks:                               know the electronic materials that are available, and the types                  of questions for which each can be used                 perform searches of electronic materials                 interpret basic error messages                 refer users to pertinent sections of documentation                 assist users in performing routine operations                             Staff will assist users in accessing any electronic resource, but                staff are not expected to work through every step of any program                with individual users. At the staff members discretion extra assistance                can be provided as time permits. Assistance with manipulating personal                data, such as resumes, term papers, etc., may be considered beyond                the normal level of assistance.               When the standard level of assistance to an individual becomes                problematic, staff should offer options such as documentation in                the form of books, manuals, tip sheets, Library programs, and referral                to training workshops.               Staff will answer telephone requests for information from the Internet                under the same guidelines of time and resource availability as are                used with print materials. (See PS #40 Reference and Readers Advisory                Service)               C. Staff Use of Electronic Resources               In order to become proficient in the use of electronic resources,                staff must use them on a regular basis. Through access to the administrative                systems, electronic mail, the Internet, and other information resources,                staff are encouraged to use the Librarys electronic resources to                support operations, enhance communication, and foster professional                development.               The electronic resources located in public areas are designed for                public use. If it is necessary for staff to use a computer located                in a pubic area, staff must not store their work on that computer.                No Library work must be left on a computer used by the public.               Access to electronic resources is solely for the purposes stated                above. Use for other purposes may result in termination of employment                and/or legal action. The Free Library reserves the right to access                all information stored in its computer system for the purpose of                insuring compliance with state and federal laws, and the conditions                listed below:                               Electronic resources may not be used for illegal purposes, including,                  but not limited to unauthorized access to systems, software, or                  data.                 Accounts are not transferable. Individuals will be held responsible                  for the use of their accounts.                 Privacy of other staff must be respected. Accounts belonging                  to others may not be used. Unauthorized staff must not attempt                  to access, delete, or edit files or mail belonging to others.                             Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to the following:                               interfering with the work of others or with their ability to                  use computer facilities                  unauthorized alteration of information in Library records                 abusive, threatening, obscene, or profane correspondence and/or                  chain letters of any kind                 unauthorized sharing of information about access to Library                  systems                 interrupting or degrading the operation of systems or networks                 unauthorized installation of hardware, software, or peripherals                 using electronic resources for personal business, or activities                  unrelated to the Library, including marketing, advertising, fundraising                  or other profit or not-for-profit activities                             Any breach of computer security by staff or users must be reported                immediately to the Information Technology Division. Breaches of                security are grounds for severe disciplinary action that may include                dismissal.               D.  Maintenance               Information Technology Division coordinates the maintenance of                electronic resources. All requests for maintenance and repair must                be communicated through the Help Desk. Routine cleaning of electronic                equipment including the screen, keyboard, mouse, etc., as determined                by Information Technology, should be part of the general housekeeping                in agencies.                         IV. Public Use of Electronic Resources             According to the Free Librarys Policy on Electronic Resources and              the Internet, the Librarys priorities for public use of electronic              resources, in priority order, are the following:                           access to resources unique to the Free Library               access to resources acquired for specific projects of programs               access to information for which there is no print equivalent at                any agency               access to databases and resources which duplicate in whole or                in part print versions               access to educational software               access to word processing, resume writing, and data processing                                                  Anyone who uses the electronic resources of the Free Library is subject              to the Librarys guidelines as a condition of that use.                            A. User Responsibilities               Because the publics demand for electronic resources exceeds the                Librarys ability to provide access, the Free Library reserves the                right to limit individual use. Guidelines for users are established                for the entire Library system, but schedules for use, sign up procedures,                and time limits are established within an agency. See Section II.                A.               Parents of minor children must assume responsibility for their                childrens use of the electronic resources through the Library,                and for monitoring, limiting, or controlling the Internet activities                of their children.               The Library assumes no responsibility for any damages, direct or                indirect, arising from use of its World Wide Web server, or from                its connection to other Internet resources.               Computer users are responsible for the following:                               using resources appropriately.                 maintaining the security and privacy of their personal data.                 respecting the integrity of the Library files as installed and                  configured by the Library.                 resolving any problems related to the invasion of their own                  privacy or loss of data. The Library assumes no liability for                  damage to the computer users data or for any damage or injury                  arising from invasion of the computer users privacy.                 storing all data on diskette. The Library may delete any information                  saved on or written to its system by computer users.                             B.  Limitations on Use               While access to electronic resources is provided equally to Library                users, there are necessarily some limitations on that use. Use is                limited in the following ways:                               Personal system software, programs, or data may not be installed                  or stored on Library computers or computer systems.                 Personal system peripherals or hardware may not be attached                  to Library computers or computer systems without authorization                  by Information Technology.                 Personal laptop computers may be plugged into electrical outlets                  in agencies, but not into data lines. Personal paper may be used                  only after staff have determined that it is compatible with printing                  capabilities.                 Computer users may not use Library resources for commercial                  activities.                 Computer users who access the Librarys electronic resources                  from non-Library computers or systems are subject to all applicable                  guidelines contained in this document as a condition of signing                  onto the system.                 Computer users should be aware of computer viruses and other                  destructive computer programs, and take steps to avoid being victims                  or unwitting distributors of these processes.                 When working with resources which include audio and/or visual                  elements, users must not use sound or images in ways which disturb                  other users or staff. Library staff will determine if one users                  activities are interfering with the activities of other patrons                  of the Library.                 Users must abide by computer use schedules set by individual                  agencies.                 Library electronic resources may be used for legal and acceptable                  purposes. Examples of illegal and unacceptable purposes include                  but are not limited to the following:                                       Destruction or damage to equipment, software, or data belonging                      to the Library or to other computer users.                     Unauthorized use of copyright-protected materials. The individual                      using copyrighted material is responsible for any infringement.                     Violation of Library computer system security or structure.                     Unauthorized use of computer access codes or passwords.                     Violation of other computer users privacy.                     Disruption of or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.                     Violation of telecommunications network usage policies,                      guidelines, rules, or regulations.                     Use of computing systems or facilities in ways which necessarily                      impede or disrupt the computing or library activities of others.                     Any and all other matters which the Library. in its sole                      discretion, and in consideration of the best interests of                      the public, determines to be an unacceptable use.                                                               C. Sanctions               Violations of the guidelines described above for general, legal,                acceptable, and cooperative use of electronic resources will be                dealt with in a serious manner, up to and including loss of Library                privileges. Wanton destruction of, or damage to equipment will be                charged to the individual causing the damage and/or parent or guardian                in the case of damage by a child. Illegal acts involving Library                electronic resources may also be subject to prosecution by local,                state, and federal authorities.                         V. Conclusion             These guidelines concern use of resources that are in a state of              change and development. These guidelines will be reviewed and updated              regularly.                                                                                        Content managed by: Communications and Marketing Department 215.686.5424"

Setting quantitative standards for technology is like nailing jello to a tree. Wisconsin has been able to set some quantities (number of computers and size of workspace around computers.) in setting guidelines for space needs. Beyond these basics, many states have found it difficult to define excellence in the use of technology.   In planning for technology improvements, a library must look at technology in a broad context. Adding x number of computers because patrons are standing in line is not good planning. A library cannot decide to ""add some more computers"" without knowing if the infrastructure (LAN, WAN, etc.) is designed to work well with the additional computers. Specifications for the computers cannot be chosen without knowing the function to be served by the computer. It is not reasonable to increase the number of Internet computers from 10 to 15 without considering that bandwidth may need to be increased and LAN cabling re-evaluated. Just as collection development staff must be aware of community wants and needs, collection policies, collection budgets, shelving space, etc., to do well in developing collections, libraries must know how technology will fit into the services/collections goals of the library.   Setting standards for technology improvement decisions are based on many variables: functions, infrastruture, technical support, etc. Quantitative technology standards are difficult because of technology's relationship to other areas of running a library.   Within this context, some minimum standards for number of computers for the staff and the public can be given, along with some other minimum requirements. Beyond mimimum standards, the Alabama Public Library Service has developed standards to address quality service and collections rather than concentrating on numbers.     Buildings       Buildings should be surveyed for electrical outlets and for locations for   cabling.  Servers should be on own circuits.   Technology related to building programs, new or renovated, is addressed in     Buildings section .     Also, see ""Public Library Space Needs"" at the   State of Wisconsin website:  http://www.dpi.state.wi.us/dlcl/pld/plspace.html    Americans with Disabilities Act -- ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities   (ADAAG)  http://www.access-board.gov/adaag/html/adaag.htm     see also  Acoustics  -- For soundproofing ideas, see the SilentSource web pages:  http://www.silentsource.com/index.html         Technology Planning and Management           A library should have a budget plan that addresses the ongoing cost of   technology, including hardware/software upgrades and maintenance and Internet   services.             Access to a full-time systems manager with full-time computer technicians.     This staff can be within the library, within the city government or     available as contracted service with a nearby university or other entity.           A library should have staff within the library who are regularly trained     to manage/troubleshoot the system.              Cooperation/Collaboration           It is recommended that public libraries contribute to statewide databases,   such as catalogs and union lists of serials.             Access to the databases provided by the Alabama Virtual Library with     output options to include printing, saving and e-mail.       Library Catalog           A library will have an automated library system using PAC, circulation and   cataloging modules.       Library software upgrades are scheduled (lag no greater than one version   behind current version )         USMARC format recommended for catalog records.   Records are   from reliable sources (not usually keyed in from scratch).           Librarians should follow the rules for bibliographic description found in     the latest edition of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules AACR2 (currently     2nd ed., 1998 rev.)             It is recommended that librarians use the latest edition of the Library of     Congress Subject Headings, to ensure that all materials about a subject will     be consistently listed under the same heading.             It is recommended that public libraries do provide web access to their     library catalogs.             The library is backing up circulation and OPAC data on a regular schedule     - making disks or tapes of that information and keeping it separate from its     original location.           Retrospective conversion of your collection can take from 11/2 to 2 years     depending on the size of your library. You can pay vendors for the     conversion process, however, fine-tuning must be done by librarians to make     sure the database is correct.   Select a vendor based on technical reports of their system, demonstrations   of their systems, and visits to libraries that use their systems. Base   selection of a vendor on the needs of your user population (such as dial-in   access).   Libraries planning networks with other libraries to provide circulation and   public access catalogs should follow the same criteria as above.  Some   other suggestions follow:           A Request for Proposal (RFP) should be developed by the library staff       and should include questions from all departments of the library. The       proposal should be detailed enough to allow the vendors to understand how       your network is to function.       Site visits to libraries using these systems are very important. Discuss       the efficiency of the system with library staff that will use the system.       Be sure that your vendor can supply software that allows each library in       the system to have their own fines and loan period. Some aspects of the       system will have to be a network policy that affects all members.       A library should have the ability to load third party records onto their       automated library system.           Electronic Collections     Libraries should explore enhancing collections through the use of databases and educational programs, available on CD-ROM, DVD and other multimedia/data storage devices.       Technology Training       Written guidelines outline how patrons should be instructed, either in a   group or one-on-one, in the basics of computer use and needed applications,   e.g., Alabama Virtual Library.     A computer lab separate from public computers are recommended for group     classes and hands-on instruction.       The Internet         Remote access for patrons to the library catalog and AVL databases.       Internet Policy lists responsibilities of Internet use.               Refer to  http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/internetusepolicies.html .               Internet Policy should be reviewed at minimum every six months.         Signed Internet use agreement should be kept on file acknowledging     guidelines.                 Adopt a comprehensive, written Internet use policy that addresses at least     the following--                      Sets forth reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions             Expressly prohibits any use of library equipment to access material  that is obscene, is child pornography, or is harmful to minors (consistent with any applicable state or local law)                       Provides for the privacy of users with respect to public terminals                       Protects the confidentiality of records, electronic or otherwise, that       identify individual users and link them to search strategies, sites     accessed, or other specific data about the information they retrieved     or sought to retrieve.                    Communicates the relevant policies for use of Internet-access           computers to        all library users, and include the parents of children who may use           the library           without direct parental supervision. Does so in a clear and conspicuous manner sufficient to alert library users that filtering software is not utilized             or is utilized and how.                      Posts notices at all Internet-access computers that use of library     equipment to access the illegal materials specified in the Internet use policy is  prohibited.                       Offers a variety of programs, at convenient times, to educate library     users,  including parents and children, on the use of the Internet. Publicize     them widely.                   Offers library users recommended Internet sites.            Web Pages            A library web site is recommended that describes library services and     collections and containing links to selected related sites.                Hyperlinks on web pages to web-available reference materials and other       pertinent information.                  Web pages are registered with different search engines.                  Meta tags succinctly describe your web pages.                  Webpages are constructed with the objective of training/educating in       service/collection areas emphasized by the library, e.g., genealogy       research.                         Computers and Networking       Minimum Recommendations for Communication Links--       1 to 3 PC's--56K v.90 Dialup Modem     4 to 15 PC's-- ISDN or Frame Relay, or DSL     16 and above --Fractional T1, T1, T3 or fiber       Libraries with 3 or more computers should have a Local Area Network     (LAN)--connecting computers and sharing printers, access to the Internet and     the catalog.   Some computers are designated for staff use only.   The library has created profiles so that groups and users are defined.    Staff and patrons should have controls on what they can  and cannot view   or perform on computers.   The suggested protocol for both LAN's and WAN's is TCP/IP using Static IP   Addressing or DHCP.     The library has written documentation of availability of Z39.50 protocol     [which flavor] for staff and patron use.     The library has provisions for and written documentation describing the     use of portable technologies, e.g., laptops, e-books.     Written guidelines are provided to staff to describe appropriate use of     staff computers, including responsibilities for security and backing up     files.     Written guidelines outline regular maintenance requirements for hardware, software,     files and computer equipment.     A written computer replacement schedule should be in place. Given a     three-year life span, a recommended computer replacement schedule would be     replacing one third of machines each year. (Older machines can be used for     less demanding applications, e.g., word processing.)     A library should have a written basic diagram of their network describing     the physical layout of wiring and functions of hardware and components.     A library has written documentation addressing adaptive needs, describing     equipment available to assist persons with disabilities, training available     and policies/procedures.     A library should use an Intranet to provide information for staff:     training, policies, procedures, guidelines, forms and to offer     opportunities for collaborative work and to streamline the work     environment.                                ********************************   Sources of General Guidelines   Weaving a Secure Web Around Education: A Guide to Technology Standards and Security     A pdf  publication of the National Center For Education Statistics' National Forum on Education Statistics   *******************   All-in-One Web Sites for Technology Issues                        The Library Web Manager's Reference Center       http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Web4Lib/RefCenter/     Internet Software; Assistive Technology; Training Materials; HTML; XML;  Library-Specific Design; Graphics Editors; Clip art olor tools | Fonts| Scripting & Programming; Web Server Administration;   Anti-Virus Measures; System Recovery;  Application Launchers; Session Monitors; Print Managers;| Security Software; Windows;Proxies; Filters;  Metadata...and more.        Last updated   04/19/2003  by Theresa C.

GX001-29-9633431	"EXPLORATORY CENTER GRANTS FOR HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH   RELEASE DATE:  October 16, 2002   RFA:  GM-03-003     National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)   ( http://www.nigms.nih.gov )    LETTER OF INTENT RECEIPT DATE:  February 13, 2003; standard time limit  for P20s  APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE:  March 13, 2003   THIS RFA CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION  o Purpose of this RFA o Research Objectives o Mechanism(s) of Support o Funds Available o Eligible Institutions o Individuals Eligible to Become Principal Investigators o Special Requirements  o Where to Send Inquiries o Letter of Intent o Submitting an Application o Peer Review Process o Review Criteria o Receipt and Review Schedule o Award Criteria o Required Federal Citations  PURPOSE OF THIS RFA  The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) invites  applications for P20 Exploratory Grants that will support multi- investigator teams to conduct research using human embryonic stem cells  (HESC). The purpose of this RFA is to encourage and enable basic  biologists with little or no prior HESC experience to work with HESC  and establish the utility of HESC as a model system by: 1) supporting  the development of an institutional infrastructure for research using  HESC; 2) encouraging research on the growth and maintenance  requirements of HESC; 3) identifying biochemical and molecular markers  of HESC; 4) stimulating research that will lead to a better  understanding of the unique properties of HESC; and 5) supporting pilot  projects that exploit the advantages of HESC as a model system to  further the study of fundamental research problems. The source of HESC  will be limited to federally approved stem cell lines listed on the NIH  Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry, which can be found at   http://escr.nih.gov .   RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Background  On August 9, 2001, President Bush announced his decision to allow  Federal funds to be used for research on existing human embryonic stem  cell lines. Subsequently, the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry  was created to provide a listing of federally approved Human Embryonic  Stem Cell Lines  http://escr.nih.gov  that may be used for such research.  The availability of HESC for federally funded research affords a unique  opportunity for investigators to use these cells to address fundamental  research questions. However, most institutions and investigators have  little or no prior experience in growing and maintaining HESC and  remarkably little is known about the molecular and genetic properties  of HESC that distinguish them from more differentiated cells.  Therefore, NIGMS hosted a workshop on the Basic Biology of Mammalian  Stem Cells in order to bring stem cell researchers and basic biologists  together to 1) better understand the unique properties of embryonic  stem cells and 2) to consider how embryonic stem cells might be  exploited as a model system to advance the study of fundamental  research problems. The report of that workshop can be found at   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/reports/stemcellworkshop.html .  The workshop report summarizes many fascinating opportunities to use  HESC to study important biological problems and identifies activities  that need to be addressed in order to stimulate and facilitate the use  of HESC as a model system. These activities include: continued  interdisciplinary collaborations and discussions between stem cell  researchers and basic biologists; characterization of improved  conditions for the growth of HESC and their maintenance in a  pluripotent, undifferentiated state; characterization of molecular  markers that distinguish HESC from more differentiated cells (including  adult stem cells); and funding initiatives to encourage, enable and  train basic biologists to work with HESC and to initiate pilot projects  using HESC as a model system. As a result, NIGMS is issuing this RFA to  stimulate HESC research and to address these immediate needs.   Scope of Research  The objective of this RFA is to encourage and enable basic biologists to  work with HESC and to initiate pilot projects using HESC as a model  system to study research problems that are central to the mission of  NIGMS. NIGMS supports basic research that addresses fundamental  biological questions. Applicants should visit the NIGMS website at   http://www.nih.gov/nigms  for detailed information on NIGMS areas of  research interest. NIGMS does not support research that is targeted to  specific organ systems or diseases.   Areas of research that are appropriate for support by this RFA include:   1) studies on improved conditions for the growth of HESC and their  maintenance in an undifferentiated state  2) further characterization of the unique molecular properties of HESC  that distinguish them from other stem cell populations (e.g., adult  stem cells) and from more differentiated cells  3) development of reagents that will facilitate the use of HESC as a  model system 4) comparative studies of HESC and adult stem cells or animal stem  cells 5) pilot studies on the use of HESC as a model system to address basic  research problems that may include, but are not limited to: o  regulation of gene expression and gene expression networks  o  epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including genomic  imprinting o  determinants of differentiation, dedifferentiation and nuclear  reprogramming  o  chromosome, chromatin and telomere structure and function o  regulation of cell proliferation   o  the basis of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division  o  signaling pathways required for cell adhesion and cell migration 6) pilot studies on the use of HESC as a primary cell type for drug  discovery.  NIGMS strongly encourages potential applicants to discuss their ideas  with NIGMS program staff and to send a letter of intent prior to  submission to ensure that the application will be responsive to the  NIGMS mission and the intent of this RFA.   Exploratory Center Grant Activities  Exploratory Center Grants will be expected to: 1) establish and support  institutional core facilities that can be used for the growth and  maintenance of HESC, for the further characterization of HESC  properties, and for development of reagents and tools that will enhance  the use of HESC as a model system; 2) propose three pilot research  projects that test the usefulness of HESC as a model system to address  basic research problems; 3) provide research and training opportunities  for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows interested in working  with HESC; and 4) sponsor interdisciplinary workshops or meetings that  foster an exchange of ideas and information between stem cell  biologists and basic biologists. NIGMS expects to bring Exploratory  Center Grant awardees to the NIH at least once during the term of the  awards to discuss progress and exchange information. Travel funds  should be budgeted for this purpose.    MECHANISM OF SUPPORT   This RFA will use the NIH P20 Exploratory Center Grant mechanism.  Applicants will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and  executing the proposed project. This RFA is a one-time solicitation  with an expected award date in September, 2003.   Although P20 Exploratory Grants will not be renewable, NIGMS expects to  issue a subsequent RFA to support full-scale research centers, using  the P50 mechanism. Such centers would have expanded core capabilities  to grow and characterize HESC, to develop tools and reagents needed for  HESC research, and to manage and disseminate experimental data. Such  centers would be expected to support multiple research projects  utilizing HESC to address important biological problems and to offer  research training and community outreach activities. While award of a  P20 Exploratory Grant may enhance an institution's subsequent ability  to apply for a P50 Center Grant for HESC research, receipt of a P20  Exploratory Center award will not be a pre-requisite for submission of  future P50 Center applications.   This RFA uses just-in-time concepts and the non-modular budgeting  format (see  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/modular/modular.htm ).    FUNDS AVAILABLE    NIGMS intends to commit $2 million in FY 2003 to fund two to three new  P20 Exploratory Grants in response to this RFA. An applicant may  request a project period of three years and up to $500,000 direct costs  per year. Costs for major items of equipment or indirect costs  associated with consortium or sub-contractual arrangements will not be  considered as part of the $500,000 direct cost limit. Because the  nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to  application, the size of each award also may vary. Although the  financial plan of NIGMS sets aside funds to support this initiative,  awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of  funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious  applications. Exploratory Center Grants will not be renewable.   ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS   You may submit an application(s) if your institution is a domestic  organization and has any of the following characteristics:   o  Non-profit organizations  o  Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges,  hospitals, and laboratories  o  Units of state and local governments o  Eligible agencies of the Federal government    Applications from foreign institutions and for-profit organizations  will not be accepted; however, subcontracts to foreign institutions and  for-profit organizations may be included.   INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS     Any individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to  carry out the proposed research is invited to work with his/her  institution to develop an application for support. Investigators are  not required to have prior experience with HESC. Individuals from  underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with  disabilities are always encouraged to apply for NIH programs.     SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS    The Principal Investigator of the Exploratory Center Grant will be  expected to commit a minimum effort of 25%. Applications may be  considered for Federal funding only if the cell line(s) proposed for  use is listed on the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry  ( http://escr.nih.gov ). Applications must specify the HESC cell line to  be used and include the NIH identification number in the Description on  page 2. Awards will not be made until access to eligible HESC is  documented.

Sunshine, Ph.D.  Office of Scientific Review  NIGMS 45 Center Drive, Room 3AN.12F Bethesda, MD 20892-6200   APPLICATION PROCESSING: Applications must be received by the  application receipt date listed in the heading of this RFA. If an  application is received after that date, it will be returned to the  applicant without review.   The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will not accept any application  in response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently  pending initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending  application. The CSR will not accept any application that is  essentially the same as one already reviewed. This does not preclude  the submission of substantial revisions of applications already  reviewed, but such applications must include an Introduction addressing  the previous critique.  PEER REVIEW PROCESS     Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by the CSR  and responsiveness by the NIGMS. Note that applicants are required to  include the NIH code number identifying the eligible cell line that is  to be used in the proposed research. Applications that do not provide  this information will be returned without review.  Applications that are complete and responsive to the RFA will be  evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer  review group convened by the NIGMS in accordance with the review  criteria stated below. As part of the initial merit review, all  applications will:  o  Receive a written critique o  Undergo a process in which all applications will be discussed and   assigned a priority score o  Receive a second level review by the National Advisory General  Medical Sciences Council.    REVIEW CRITERIA  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.   In the written comments, reviewers will be asked to discuss the  following aspects of an application in order to judge the likelihood  that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the  pursuit of these goals:   o Significance  o Approach  o Innovation o Investigator o Environment    The scientific review group will address and consider each of these  criteria in assigning an application's overall score, weighting them as  appropriate for each application. An application does not need to be  strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific  impact and thus deserve a high priority score. For example, an  applicant may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is  not innovative but is essential to move a field forward. If the P20  Exploratory Center Grant application includes distinct subprojects, the  scientific merit of each will be assessed, based on its merit as an  independent effort and its potential importance/contribution to the  success of the overall effort (however, the projects will not receive  separate scores).  (1) SIGNIFICANCE:  Do the PI and other investigators address an  important problem? If the aims of the pilot research projects are  achieved, how do they advance scientific knowledge? What will be the  effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive this  field?  (2) APPROACH:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and  analyses adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the  aims of the projects? Do the investigators acknowledge potential  problem areas and consider alternative tactics?  (3) INNOVATION:  Do the projects employ novel concepts, approaches or  methods? Are the aims original and innovative? Do the projects  challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or  technologies?  (4) INVESTIGATORS:  Has the PI demonstrated the necessary experience,  judgment and expertise to lead and manage the Center? Are the  investigators appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this  work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to their experience level?  (5) ENVIRONMENT:  Does the scientific environment in which the work  will be done contribute to the probability of success? Do the proposed  core and pilot projects take advantage of unique features of the  scientific environment or employ useful collaborative arrangements? Is  there evidence of institutional support?  ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your  application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o PROTECTIONS:  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans,  animals, or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely  affected by the project proposed in the application.  o INCLUSION:  The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both  genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as  appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Plans for the  recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated (see  Inclusion Criteria included in the section on Federal Citations,  below).  o BUDGET:  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested  period of support in relation to the proposed research.  OTHER REVIEW CRITERIA:  o Do the proposed plans for the core appear adequate to grow, maintain  and further characterize HESC?  o Are the choices of pilot projects good ones to exploit the unique  potential of HESC as a model system?  o If the investigators do not have prior experience or preliminary data  using HESC, is their overall expertise consistent with proposed core  activities and pilot studies using HESC? Have they adequately described  plans to acquire additional expertise?  RECEIPT AND REVIEW SCHEDULE  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:  February 13, 2003 Application Receipt Date:  March 13, 2003 Peer Review Date:  June/July, 2003 Council Review:  September, 2003 Earliest Anticipated Start Date:  September, 2003  AWARD CRITERIA  Award criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o Scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o Availability of funds o Programmatic priorities.   REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS   MONITORING PLAN AND DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARD: Research  components involving Phase I and II clinical trials must include  provisions for assessment of patient eligibility and status, rigorous  data management, quality assurance, and auditing procedures.  In  addition, it is NIH policy that all clinical trials require data and  safety monitoring, with the method and degree of monitoring being  commensurate with the risks (NIH Policy for Data Safety and Monitoring,  NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, June 12, 1998:   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html ).    INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH: It is the policy  of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub- populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research  projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided  indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of  the subjects or the purpose of the research. This policy results from  the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT  ""NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in  Clinical Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide  for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html ); a  complete copy of the updated Guidelines are available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm .  The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition  of clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories in  compliance with the new OMB standards; clarification of language  governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials consistent with the new  PHS Form 398; and updated roles and responsibilities of NIH staff and  the extramural community.  The policy continues to require for all NIH- defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all applications or  proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to  conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender  and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b)  investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group  differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN  SUBJECTS: The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals  under the age of 21) must be included in all human subjects research,  conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and  ethical reasons not to include them. This policy applies to all initial  (Type 1) applications submitted for receipt dates after October 1,  1998.  All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should  read the ""NIH Policy and Guidelines"" on the inclusion of children as  participants in research involving human subjects that is available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm .   REQUIRED EDUCATION ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECT PARTICIPANTS: NIH  policy requires education on the protection of human subject  participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for research  involving human subjects.  You will find this policy announcement in the  NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcement, dated June 5, 2000, at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html .  HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS (HESC): Criteria for federal funding of  research on HESCs can be found at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/stem_cells.htm  and at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-005.html .   Only research using HESC lines that are registered in the NIH Human  Embryonic Stem Cell Registry will be eligible for Federal funding (see   http://escr.nih.gov ). It is the responsibility of the applicant to  provide the official NIH identifier(s) for the HESC line(s) to be used  in the proposed research. Applications that do not provide this  information will be returned without review.    PUBLIC ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT:  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 has been  revised to provide public access to research data through the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA) under some circumstances.  Data that are (1)  first produced in a project that is supported in whole or in part with  Federal funds and (2) cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency  in support of an action that has the force and effect of law (i.e., a  regulation) may be accessed through FOIA.  It is important for  applicants to understand the basic scope of this amendment.  NIH has  provided guidance at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm .  Applicants may wish to place data collected under this RFA in a public  archive, which can provide protections for the data and manage the  distribution for an indefinite period of time. If so, the application  should include a description of the archiving plan in the study design  and include information about this in the budget justification section  of the application. In addition, applicants should think about how to  structure informed consent statements and other human subjects  procedures given the potential for wider use of data collected under  this award.  URLs IN NIH GRANT APPLICATIONS OR APPENDICES: All applications and  proposals for NIH funding must be self-contained within specified page  limitations. Unless otherwise specified in an NIH solicitation, Internet  addresses (URLs) should not be used to provide information necessary to  the review because reviewers are under no obligation to view the  Internet sites. Furthermore, we caution reviewers that their anonymity  may be compromised when they directly access an Internet site.  HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to  achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of  ""Healthy People 2010,"" a PHS-led national activity for setting priority  areas. This RFA is related to one or more of the priority areas.  Potential applicants may obtain a copy of ""Healthy People 2010"" at   http://www.health.gov/healthypeople .  AUTHORITY AND REGULATIONS: This program is described in the Catalog of  Federal Domestic Assistance No. 93.821; 93.862; 93.859 and is not  subject to the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order  12372 or Health Systems Agency review.  Awards are made under  authorization of Sections 301 and 405 of the Public Health Service Act  as amended (42 USC 241 and 284) and administered under NIH grants  policies described at  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/policy.htm   and under Federal Regulations 42 CFR 52 and 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92.   The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke- free workplace and discourage the use of all tobacco products.  In  addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits  smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a  facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care,  health care, or early childhood development services are provided to  children.  This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and  advance the physical and mental health of the American people.

Yet the            distinctions between these terms are important when understanding the            roles and responsibilities of board members.            4.1 POLICIES            Policies are written statements that become administrative documents            reflecting the library's and its governing body's goals and objectives.            They also serve as guidelines for the conduct of library personnel in            the performance of their duties. Policies are flexible, which does not            mean that they are made to be broken, but that they are dynamic and            can be changed as the need arises. Library policies should be reviewed            regularly, and, as goals and objectives change, should be revised to            keep them current. As policies are approved by the library advisory            board, a board officer generally submits these policies to its governing            body (the city council for municipal libraries or the county commissioners            for county libraries) for formal adoption. The library director can            advise the board whether or not revisions to existing policies must            be submitted to its governing body for adoption or if revisions can            be submitted to an administrative official for approval. Usually, revisions            involving fees must be presented to the governing body but other revisions            may require only administrative approval. Policies often must be submitted            to the governing body's attorney for review prior to adoption by the            governing body. There are two types of policy: external and internal.                     4.2 EXTERNAL POLICIES            External policies determine the kind of interaction between the library            and its users and the ways in which programs and services are delivered.            These policies should be prefaced by the library's mission statement,            its goals and objectives, and definitions of its primary roles in the            community. The policies themselves may include topics such as collection            development, challenged materials, gifts and donations, circulation            of materials, conditions for issuing library cards, use of meeting rooms,            fines and fees assessed by the library, access to electronic resources            such as online databases and the Internet, and public relations activities.                     As of this writing, Texas public library boards are developing policies            determining public access to the Internet and discussing attendant issues            such as the use of filters, privacy screens, and software designed to            protect users' confidentiality. At this time, policy decisions for this            service area are in question due to the initiation of laws to regulate            these activities in libraries receiving federal funding. Currently,            these proposed laws are in debate but not yet passed, and the resolution            of these laws may affect many Texas public libraries receiving federal            grants. Some local governments already require libraries under their            jurisdiction to either use filters or eliminate the service altogher.            Citizens' rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union are            challenging such regulations in court, and the outcome of these actions            is yet to be determined.            The purpose of the above discussion is to point out that despite efforts            to support intellectual freedom by recommending policies designed to            ensure free public access to library services and resources, occasionally            these decisions are beyond the control of library boards, staffs, and            other intellectual freedom advocates. It also exemplifies the importance            of library board members' staying abreast of legislative issues that            impact their library's services.           return to top            4.3 INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND THE FREEDOM TO READ            Well written, duly adopted policies are crucial in a library's defense            and resolution to challenged materials and resources. A challenge occurs            when an individual or a group seeks to remove or limit access to library            materials (books, videos, audio tapes, etc.) or library resources (electronic            media, the Internet, etc.). A ban occurs when an individual or a group            succeeds in convincing the library's governing body to order the withdrawal            of materials or resources from the library.            Although public perception of challenged materials focuses on ""dirty            books,"" there are many reasons other than sexual content that precipitate            challenges to library holdings. History books on the Salem witch trials            have been challenged for their discussion of witchcraft; Laura Ingalls            Wilder's  Little House on the Prairie  books have been challenged            for their treatment of native Americans;  Huckleberry Finn  has            been challenged for its depiction of juvenile independence as well as            its characterization of Huck's friend, Jim. At the time of this writing,            a library's offer of free public access to the Internet can generate            acrimonious debate in Texas communities. Although Internet access is            generally challenged on the grounds of the pornographic content of many            of its web sites, it is frequently challenged on philosophical and political            issues similar to those described above.            At their most disruptive extremes, such challenges can cause sufficient            upheaval that all other work of a library can virtually stop while the            library's board, director, and staff devote their time and energy to            answering citizen inquiries, providing media interviews, planning meetings,            and working with the governing body's attorneys, administrators, and            elected officials to resolve the issue.            The library board's responsibility in these cases is to uphold the            principles of intellectual freedom and the freedom to read. A library's            mission statement may include language providing for ""wide and diverse            collections in a variety of formats;"" or for providing ""a safe and confidential            environment in which users may freely pursue intellectual interests.""            Mission statements including such language place advocates in the position            of defending intellectual freedom as the library's stated mission as            well as on the broarder principle of intellectual freedom. It is essential            that board members, the director, staff, and other library advocates            in the community show respect for opposing viewpoints at all times,            and remain sensitive to the right of all citizens to express their opinions            and concerns.            Intellectual freedom is a term encompassing the broad ideal ""freedom            of the mind"" and includes not only the constitutionally protected freedoms            of speech and of the press, but also, by extension, the freedoms to            hear, view, and read. These freedoms are at the heart of library service            to the public. These are simplistic definitions for complex and volatile            issues. They are presented thoroughly in the American Library Association's            publication,  Intellectual Freedom Manual, Fifth Edition , compiled            by the ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom and published in 1996; and            the Texas Library Association's publication, Intellectual Freedom Handbook,            Fifth Edition, prepared by the Intellectual Freedom Committee of TLA,            also published in 1996. (This manual is available in print and on the            TLA home page at  www.txla.org/docs/ifhbk.html .)                     These books present historical and philosophical overviews of intellectual            freedom issues, as well as interpretations and practical guidelines            and resources available to libraries facing challenges to their materials.            They also provide sample policies modeling protection of users' intellectual            freedom rights. Appendix A of this manual, ""Library Position Papers,""            provides more in-depth discussion of intellectual freedom issues and            includes the TLA and ALA intellectual freedom statements and their interpretations.            Three crucial components of a library's defense against challenges            to its holdings are the materials selection policy, the Internet access            or acceptable use policy, and the policy for handling challenged materials.                     Materials Selection Policy . All libraries should have a written            policy determining the process by which library staff select books and            other materials and resources. The policy will include review sources            and other professional tools used for selection as well as other criteria            for selecting materials.            Internet Access Policy (Acceptable Use Policy) . Each library            offering public access to the Internet must decide how to develop its            Internet access policy. At this time, most libraries have a separate            policy for Internet use; however, there is a trend in Texas public libraries            to incorporate their Internet policy into the body of their materials            selection policy. Issues generally covered in an Internet policy include            issues such as conditions under which a user may access the Internet,            time constraints to allow fair access, use of filters, cost (if any)            for printing, protection of confidentiality, and permissibility of downloading            onto a personal disk. A sample Internet access policy is included at            the end of this chapter.            Policy for Handling Challenged Materials (Reconsideration of Materials).              Many user complaints against library materials can be dealt with            simply through discussion between the library director and the user            making the complaint. If discussion does not satisfy the user, then            a written form should be available for the user to fill out and sign.            The point at which a user files a written statement requesting withdrawal            of the title is the point at which the complaint becomes a challenge.            Subsequent procedures will be delineated in the policy, including some            point at which the user will be invited to attend a board meeting to            formally present the challenge for board review.            The library board should recommend all such policies to the library's            governing body for adoption. As liaison between the library and its            citizens, board recommendation of the policy adds credibility for the            user. Once the governing body adopts the policy, it carries the authority            of governmental resolution or ordinance. These steps provide more favorable            conditions for successfully withstanding a prolonged or united challenge.                     Access to Services and Confidentiality of Users' Records . Two            other intellectual freedom issues citizens and outside agencies occasionally            become involved with are access to services and confidentiality of users'            records and the materials and services they request. These issues are            more fully covered in Appendix A and Appendix B of this handbook.            return to top           4.4 INTERNAL POLICIES            Internal policies determine the way a library provides its services.            Types of internal policies found in public libraries and the issues            they cover may include:                       Circulation  - the types of documents accepted for proof of              residency; items that may not be checked out or renewed; loan periods              on high demand items; chain of command in dealing with disputes over              fines               Reference  - how many reference questions may be answered              per call; the extent to which criss-cross directory service will be              delivered; the extent to which homework help will be provided; the              order in which telephone and inhouse users will be handled during              peak times               Cataloging and technical services  - what to do when a new              version of the Dewey Decimal System is issued; to what extent materials              will be classified; how to code, classify, and shelve special collections;              how vendors will be selected; who selects various types of materials             Safety/Security  - who has oversight for opening and closing              the building; who will be called in emergency situations when the              library is closed; who has oversight for maintaining fire extinguishers;              evacuation of the building in case of fire or other disaster              Intellectual freedom issues  - chain of command in dealing              with user complaints, and points at which complaintants are referred              to the next level; who speaks for the library in various stages of              challenges              Personnel  - who has oversight for scheduling; who has oversight              of time sheets; how many employees may be scheduled to be off duty              at the same time; how scheduling is communicated between departments              and to the library director; who evaluates employees              Collection development  - who selects various types of materials              and formats; who receives various types of review tools; who weeds              various collections and nonfiction titles; how ""last titles"" and discarded              items are handled              New and used materials donations  - who officially accepts              gift books; what types of materials are accepted, and what types are              not; how gifts of used materials are stored and who reviews and selects              them for inclusion into the collection; how donated materials not              selected for the collection are handled              Volunteers  - who is in charge of recruiting, training and              supervising volunteers; who determines assignments for volunteers;              what the criteria are for allowing court ordered community service              volunteers to work in the library; what the dress code is for volunteers                     4.5 PROCEDURES            Procedures are guides to action and are subordinate to and aid in implementing            policies. Procedures describe how a service is to be executed, establish            a method of handling repetitive tasks, and specify how a policy is to            be implemented. Procedures tend to be chronological, listing a sequence            of steps to be performed, or providing a timetable. Examples of procedures            include the steps to be taken to process an interlibrary loan request,            issue a new library card, sign up for computer time, or reserve meeting            rooms.            The library director and departmental supervisors establish and revise            procedures to provide the most effective, efficient methods for carrying            out general operating policies. The library board generally does not            become involved in establishing and implementing procedures unless those            procedures significantly impact the board itself, such as developing            and posting agendas, or determining the content and distribution of            board meeting packets. Staff reports to the board should, however, mention            changes in procedures that impact the public perception of service delivery,            such as procedures for registering for story times. Knowing such procedural            changes prevents board members from being surprised by, and not knowing            how to respond to, users' questions concerning such changes.

GX040-77-3301075	"Descriptive Resource Needs from the Reference Perspective:  Report on a Survey of US Reference Librarians  for the   Bicentennial Conference on Bibliographic Control for the New Millennium   Library of Congress  November 15-17, 2000  by  Carolyn Larson  Business Reference Librarian  Science, Technology, & Business Division  Library of Congress  and  Linda Arret  Network Development Specialist  Marc Standards and Network Development Office  Library of Congress   Final version      This paper presents a discussion of what reference librarians require with regard to the bibliographic control of networked resources, based on 200 responses to a survey of U.S. reference providers and on comments made at an open meeting on this topic sponsored by the Library of Congress at the July 2000 American Library Association (ALA) Annual Meeting in Chicago.     Overall, the responses to the survey reflect the growing reliance of reference providers on Web-based resources. Almost half reported consulting print/microfilm resources and local networked digital resources ""somewhat"" or ""much less frequently,"" than a year ago whereas considerably more than half reported consulting subscription Internet resources, search engines, and other freely available web-based resources  ""somewhat"" or ""much more frequently"" than a year ago.     Approximately forty percent of the responding libraries reported providing access to  online subscription  or  selected free Internet  resources through the OPAC. Most of the remainder  provide access only through web lists or book marks. In contrast, over eighty percent of the respondents indicated that, in their opinion, selected Internet-based resources  should be  included in the OPAC. Overall, respondents suggested that if Web-based resources are included in the OPAC, it would be most useful from a public service perspective if there were records in the catalog for the individual titles included within aggregated resources or within a Web site rather than for the aggregated resource itself or for the top-level Web site only. For those libraries cataloging either subscription or free Internet resources, about two-thirds report providing AACR2 level cataloging. With regard to the cataloging elements most needed for searching, over two-thirds of the respondents selected the following ten: title, subject keywords, URL, author/creator, link to an index/keyword search of the resource itself, controlled subject vocabulary, date of last update, time period covered by the resource, language of resource, and links to table of contents. With regard to those cataloging elements that must be included in the catalog record regardless of whether or not they are used for searching, over two thirds selected the following ten elements in addition to the previously listed ten elements: date of creation, genre, publisher, copyright/access restrictions, relationships to other works, format, geographic coverage, summaries of the resource, other unique identifying numbers and a statement that the resource is peer-reviewed.       In their free text comments, respondents singled out a number of problems with regard to the bibliographic control of Internet resources within the OPAC including: the need for title access for the full-text titles included in aggregator databases; the need to collapse multiple records for multiple versions/formats of the same intellectual content into a single ""record"" for public view; the need for greater collaboration both between public service and technical service departments within institutions and among multiple institutions in the selection and control of these resources; the need to ensure the long-term availability of those networked resources added to the OPAC's through greater attention to archival issues, and finally, the need to develop a single user-friendly ""interface"" that would allow users to link across relevant databases .      Respondents also included comments related to improving search retrieval on the Web at large. These included suggestions focusing on the use of intelligent agents, automated categorization of Web resources, information visualization technologies, and the  application  of concepts from traditional librarianship coupled with the use of XML and innovative technology, most notably in proposals to find ways to match natural language queries with standardized subjects and authorized names and in proposals for encouraging widespread use of unique identifiers for web pages or content including proposals to work cooperatively with selected publishers in order to provide  librarian-created  metadata to publishers which they could add to the HTML headers of their resources.           Survey Focus:         In developing the survey which forms the basis for our presentation, we attempted to address the following:        Standard descriptive elements that professional reference providers believe to be essential in performing their work;     Additional descriptive elements which reference librarians believe would facilitate achieving accurate and useful content retrieval in response to user queries and information demands;    Optimum ""levels"" of library and metadata descriptions (including descriptive/subject/administrative/access metadata) for content retrieval of Web-based resources (e.g. full MARC records; simpler, more structured Dublin Core records);     Traditional concepts, such as authority files, uniform titles, specialized thesauri, that might be incorporated into metadata descriptions to facilitate resource discovery;    Problems which reference providers are experiencing in identifying relevant materials in an online environment which might be addressed through improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies.     Description of survey instrument:   In an attempt to assess reference needs in this area, the survey contained:      some basic questions about how the respondent's library was currently providing access to networked resources (and the reference librarian's satisfaction with current access at their institution). These questions focused on:       distinctions between bibliographic control of subscription and/or licensed resources and freely available Internet resources of ""reference value""       the level of granularity of such bibliographic control and how libraries were coping with bibliographic control of resources supplied by aggregators and database producers.       a series of questions focused on the cataloging elements reference librarians view as most important for inclusion in such records       a series of questions focused on reference providers' reactions to various proposals that have been made for dealing with the cataloging of electronic resources, including:        providing access through separate web lists vs access through the OPAC.        providing different types or levels of control to subscription/licensed resources and ""free"" Internet resources       utilizing some type of ""core"" or ""minimal"" level of cataloging for electronic resources as opposed to full MARC cataloging.        providing single records vs multiple records for resources available in multiple formats (e.g. print and electronically).       a number of open-ended questions about the major problems related to bibliographic control that reference librarians are facing in identifying (or assisting patrons in identifying) pertinent electronic resources and potential solutions to these problems from a reference point of view.       Finally, several questions were also included regarding the size and type of the library, the subject areas in which reference service is provided, the extent of use of electronic resources in providing that reference service, the number of years the respondent had worked in reference, and the respondent's general familiarity with various metadata schemes and projects making use of metadata. These later questions allowed us to consider if there might be differences among the answers given by groups of respondents based on the any of the above factors.        Background on the Respondents:      The Selection Process     Information about the survey (which was posted on the Library of Congress Web site) was sent by email to heads of reference or library directors of approximately 450 U.S. libraries. Drawing on unpublished statistics from the U.S. Dept. of Education showing number of reference transactions, size of staff, and expenditures by reporting U.S. libraries, information in the  American Library Directory , and information on individual library web sites, we endeavored to contact a small, medium, and large public library and a small, medium, and large academic library in each US state[1], as well as a non-academic library from each of the Special Library Association chapters and divisions. In addition, we endeavored to contact each of the US state libraries and the four US national libraries. Each library was offered the opportunity to supply two responses. The survey was also announced at the end of June on a number of reference listservs prior to an open meeting at the July 2000 American Library Association Annual Meeting at which the topic was discussed, and twenty responses were obtained from that posting. A total of two hundred responses (representing one hundred sixty-nine libraries) were received, broken down as follows:        Academic libraries:    70 responses                                                               (representing 58  libraries out of 159 libraries contacted)     Public libraries:      56 responses                                                               (representing 47 institutions out of 151 libraries contacted)     State libraries:   29 responses                                                                (representing 24 libraries out of 46 libraries contacted. Several  state libraries  were not contacted because a valid email address could not be located)                    Special libraries:   22 responses                                                               (representing 21 institutions out of 94 libraries contacted)    US National libraries:   2 responses                              (Both from LC.  The National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, and the National Education Library were also  contacted, but did not respond.  In addition,  two of the responses in the Listserv category are from LC employees)   Listserv postings:   20 responses       (15 of those libraries identified themselves as ""Academic,"" 2 as ""public,"" 1 as ""private non-profit""; 1 as ""private for profit""; and 1 as ""governmental."")      Total  responses:             200   Total  libraries represented:   169    Total  libraries contacted:      453     In addition, we received 17 direct replies (email or telephone) from librarians indicating that after looking at the survey, they felt that they could not respond. Their reasons varied from the academic librarian who said that between relocating and opening for the new school year, her library did not have the resources to respond, to the state library which indicated its function was more coordination than reference, to a special librarian, who wryly observed that the information center at her organization had been deep-sixed and she was now functioning in a different capacity within the organization. However, most of the libraries in this category gave as their reasons for non-response small size and lack of online databases of any description in their library. The following two comments are typical:     When I looked at the survey, I decided our library should pass the opportunity to respond on to another library from our area since in our small library we have neither an online catalog nor any databases.     When I got to the question about whether access to databases such as those available through FirstSearch was by OPAC or Web, I wanted to cry. I'd be happy if we had  ArtIndex  in electronic form at all, regardless of whether we accessed it from the OPAC or the Web, or both.     Characteristics of Respondents       A little more than half of the respondents (110) report they work in institutions having 1-10 reference staff. Slightly more than half (104) report working in reference less than fifteen years compared with those reporting fifteen or more years of work in reference positions (94); almost one third (61) reported more than twenty years experience. Thirty-eight respondents are part of what we are calling, for want of a better term, a ""metadata aware"" group, which includes those who indicated either ""substantial knowledge"" or ""general understanding"" of at least six out of eleven metadata projects/schemes listed on the survey or who indicated ""substantial knowledge"" of either three and ""general understanding"" of two of these projects/schemes or ""substantial knowledge""of four and ""general understanding"" of one of them.[2]  For the responding group as a whole, there was at least name recognition by approximately half of the respondents for five of the listed projects/schemes.[3]     A few of the respondents reported being in positions in which a single ""reference"" role dominated eighty percent or more of their time: ""expert"" end user, doing searches for patrons [24]; ""trainer,"" teaching others to search (19); or ""author,"" searching in order to prepare guides, current awareness services, training materials, etc. (1). As a group, however, most of the respondents indicated that their time was more evenly split between these three roles.      With regard to the subject areas most frequently searched, the responses indicate respondents are working in a wide variety of subject areas. Multiple responses were permitted on this question: a majority of respondents (118) selected ""general reference"", but there was also significant representation from the sciences, including medicine and technology (86), business (74), humanities (63), and arts (32); other areas mentioned by respondents included government documents, fire safety, newspapers and periodicals, current events and news, and local history and genealogy.      Their searching is primarily text-based, although somewhat less than a tenth did indicate that they spend up to one half their time searching for images. When using Web-based resources, the respondents reported being least likely to turn to such resources (subscription or free) to locate a specific fact, most likely to utilize them when searching for broad information on a particular topic.      Responses to several questions regarding the frequency with which these librarians are searching particular formats in connection with reference work, indicate that, overall, they spent the least amount of their time (under 20 percent) searching local networked digital resources; the remainder of their searching time as a group was fairly evenly distributed among print resources, subscription Internet resources, search engines, and online library catalogs.      Of perhaps particular interest to this conference are the responses to questions comparing how frequently the survey respondents are using various types of resources compared to a year ago. These responses reflect the growing reliance of reference providers on Web-based resources. Almost half report consulting print/microfilm resources (98) and local networked digital resources (90) ""somewhat"" or ""much less frequently,"" whereas considerably more than half report consulting the following types of resources ""somewhat"" or ""much more frequently"": subscription Internet resources (142), search engines (122) and other freely available web-based resources exclusive of search engines and OPAC's (115).[4]         The Current Situation:     How libraries are providing control for Web resources      Karen Calhoun, in her paper for this conference [5], found all seven major ARL libraries which she surveyed were providing discovery and access to selected subscription resources both through the OPAC and via Library-created Web lists. Our survey results suggest a somewhat greater split among our respondents: sixty-eight libraries report access to subscription electronic resources through the OPAC;[6] ninety-seven through web lists alone; (with four libraries leaving the question blank).      Of those sixty-eight libraries reporting access to subscription Web resources through the OPAC,  fifty-seven are cataloging the resource (such as  FirstSearch ) itself; forty report cataloging individual databases within resources such as  FirstSearch , (for example, ""Readers' Guide Abstracts""), whereas only thirty report cataloging full-text titles within such databases.     We also asked our respondents about the level of cataloging provided for these subscription Web resources. Bear in mind that the responses to these questions are those of reference librarians, not catalogers, who may or may not have consulted with catalogers at their institutions before responding. With this caveat in mind, around two-thirds report full level AACR2 cataloging for these resources, whether at the resource, database level, or individual title level, and the remainder indicated either ""some other level"" of cataloging or ""not sure."" This latter group was asked to select from a list those cataloging elements which they typically found in catalog records for subscription Web resources at their institution today. Elements (in order of frequency cited) selected by a majority of those who reported that their institutions catalogued either the resource or the database included: title, publisher, place of publication, URL, author/creator, format [7], date of creation of resource, genre[8], and time period covered by the resource. For those reporting their institution cataloged the individual titles within resources, only title, URL, publisher, format and time period covered were cited by more than half the respondents.      The situation with regard to free Internet resources showed a somewhat greater split. Only fifty-one of the surveyed libraries report adding free Internet resources to their OPAC's. All of them are also creating weblists of selected free Internet resources. An additional one hundred libraries are providing guided access to selected web pages only through bookmarks or web lists; thirteen libraries indicated they were neither developing webliographies nor adding records for such resources to their OPACS, and five left the question blank.           Table 1   Library Access to Web Resources                            Access via Web Lists Only          Access via OPAC Only          Access via Both Web Lists and OPAC              Subscription Web Resources          97          2          66               Selected Free Web Resources          100          0          51         With regard to the levels of cataloging of free Internet resources, of the fifty-one libraries reporting access through the OPAC, thirty-three indicated that these free sites are given full AACR2 cataloging, two reported such sites were cataloged at a Dublin Core level; eleven reported ""some other level"" or ""not sure,"" and five left the question blank. We asked the group reporting ""some other level"" or ""not sure,"" in a follow-up question, to select from a list, those cataloging elements they typically found in catalog records for free Internet resources at their institutions. Elements (in order of frequency cited) selected by a majority of those responding were: title, URL, author/creator, publisher, and place of publication.  In other words, a shorter, but similar, list compared to the elements selected by this group for subscription web resources.               Degree of Satisfaction with the Current Situation      Somewhat surprisingly, by an overwhelming majority (144 of the 195 who answered this question), seventy-four percent indicated that the current method of access for web-based subscription resources at their institution (whether by Web, OPAC or both) was satisfactory for their work as reference providers.       Looking more closely at some of the characteristics of this group -- such as time spent accessing subscription web resources, type of library setting, number of reference staff, years of reference experience, subjects most frequently searched, and level of metadata awareness, we found that the percentage reporting satisfactory access remained fairly constant in all cases with the exception of those respondents working in institutions with more than twenty reference staff. In those cases, the percentage reporting satisfaction with the current mode of access dropped to just over fifty percent.      We might note that somewhat less than half of this satisfied group (60) are providing access to subscription Internet resources through the OPAC, and all that do provide catalog access also report access through web lists as well. Looking at these sixty who are accessing these resources from the OPAC, forty-seven report that the institution is cataloging the online resource itself, [9]  thirty-three, or just over half, report that their library is cataloging at the database level,[10]  while twenty-nine report that the OPAC contains records for the individual titles within such databases.[11] Twenty report that their institution is cataloging at all three levels.     Turning to free Internet resources, a smaller number, (114 out of 191),  but still a majority responded positively to a similar question about satisfaction with access to free Internet resources. Of this group, sixty-nine are accessing these resources only from the Web; forty from both the web and the OPAC, one from the OPAC only; while four reported providing no guided access from either the OPAC or the Web.      Given the relatively large number of respondents who reported that the current situation is ""satisfactory"" for their reference work, it might be tempting to assume that there is nothing more to say and conclude the paper right here. However, if we look at responses in two other sections of the survey -- a series of questions on whether such resources  should  be in the OPAC and a series of free text comments on problems and wished-for improvements -- we discover some interesting things.      First, let us look at the responses to the survey questions on whether web resources should be in the OPAC. In line with some of the discussion on the Alternative Architecture thread on the Conference listserv, eleven of our survey respondents (out of one hundred seventy-five responding) felt that neither subscription nor free Internet resources should be added to the OPAC. An additional twenty-six would incorporate records for subscription Internet resources in the OPAC, but exclude records for free Internet resources. A few added comments to reinforce their position.       Incorporating links to Internet resources from the catalog may open up the catalog to unrestricted Internet browsing which conflicts with Library Board policy, and may also result in lack of access to the catalog if the limited number of work stations are tied up by Internet users.     I have always had some misgivings about offering access to all types of resources at the same time.....We have found it very useful to suggest students keep the idea of the in-hand materials and the method of locating them (the PACs) separate from the virtual web-based resources (periodical databases, Internet databases, etc.) and the more complex methods of searching them.     In some ways, I think the library catalog should be restricted to materials the library actively acquires. Otherwise it is in danger of losing its identity. But I think some kind of cross-reference to other resources would be good.        However, the majority of respondents, including those who also reported that they found their current access satisfactory, came down on the side of adding such resources to the OPAC. Of the eighty-four who reported both that present access is satisfactory and that their institution provides access to subscription Internet resources only through web lists, forty-nine answered ""yes"" to the question on adding web-based subscription resources to the catalog. When asked if it would facilitate access to  individual titles  within subscription databases if records for them were added to the OPAC, the number of positive responses among this satisfied group, rose to sixty-six.     With regard to free Internet resources, thirty-six of the sixty-seven ""satisfied"" respondents who are not currently providing access to selected free Internet resources via their OPAC, answered ""yes"" to the question of whether it would facilitate access to these resources if they were added to the online catalog.""      Looking at the comments of those who reported that access is satisfactory for their work as reference providers, we find additional evidence that these providers still see the need for improvements in that access. Among those who report their current access is satisfactory and who provide access through the OPAC,  we found strong comments from respondents in institutions which do not catalog individual full text titles supplied by aggregators indicating a need for such access, a point even more forcefully brought home by respondents who indicated that the current situation at their institution was  not  satisfactory for their work as reference librarians. Both groups also cited difficulty in determining which journal titles are indexed in which online resources; while subject access for e-journal titles was viewed by others as inadequate. Several respondents pointed to technical problems arising in the OPAC when a single catalog serves a consortium, but access rights or access methods (IP address versus passwords) to individual resources vary by member institution.     On the other hand, among those who found access ""satisfactory"" but who provide access only through the Web, we found comments such as the following:       I think it is important to let customers know if there is an Internet-based version of something in the online catalog. We should let them know that we have the New York Times in hard copy for a certain period, and also on microfilm, and also full-text through a subscription database. Customers should know that they can read the Ohio Revised Code in our Reference section, but that they can also access the text from the Ohio State website.       Among the reasons for dissatisfaction cited by users who access these resources only via the Web:           problems with users and librarians finding or remembering what resources are available:    Although we feature the resources in many ways, they tend to get buried and lose their importance on our webpage.   It is necessary to hold too much information in one's head, that is, to remember all the places (we've already paid for) which might yield pertinent information for the question at hand.      familiar complaints about maintenance and redundancy,    Maintaining lists of links ...on the library web page leads to the need for creating redundant links on the multiple subject guide pages libraries have gotten in the practice of developing. For example, a good biography site probably belongs on every subject discipline page .... but whether multiple people maintain the multiple subject guides or a single person maintains the subject site, every time a new site is added, if it is appropriate for all the subject pages, it has to be added physically to each.      And a reminder of the primacy of the OPAC as a starting point for research which should be encouraging to this audience:    Users are still using the catalog systematically. If these resources are not in the catalog, they are not enough used.   Our online catalog should serve as a comprehensive record of all our resources, regardless of format, so librarians and patrons can tell what we have by looking in one place.                 Descriptive needs professional reference providers feel to be essential      With regard to the cataloging elements reference librarians view as most important for inclusion in catalog records, the survey attempted to address this issue through questions on current use of various metadata elements by reference providers for searching, and their perceived need for the same elements either displayed on the catalog record or as search elements. When the question was phrased as cataloging elements needed for searching only two emerged as being currently used at least fifty percent or more of the time by two-thirds or more of the 191 responding to this question: title (138) and subject keywords(138) . Rephrasing the question to ask what they thought they would use if it were possible to make all of the elements were available to them as searching elements resulted in a considerably expanded list: Of the 196 responding to this question, two-thirds or more indicated the following would be ""essential,"" or ""often useful.""          Table 2   Cataloging Elements Considered Essential or Often Useful for Searching     Cataloging Elements     Total Respondents   (out of 196 responding )     Title   185       Subject: Keywords   178     URL   166       Author/Creator   165       Index/Keyword search of resource   159       Subject: controlled vocabulary   148       Date of last update   143       Time period covered by resource   135       Language of resource   133       Table of contents   132           A specific question distinguishing between the need for elements to be present in the catalog record even if they were not generally used for searching was added following discussion at the open meeting at the American Library Association Annual Meeting  where there was general agreement that all of the elements listed in question 32 of the survey need to be present on the catalog record. [12] As one survey respondent said:       While I may not search by each of the elements listed, they are all occasionally essential in that they provide information by which to evaluate the usefulness of the information relative to my need.       The following elements were selected as being either ""essential"" or ""often useful"" to display in the catalog record by two-thirds or more of those responding to this question.   Table 3   Cataloging Elements Considered Essential or Often Useful for Display        Cataloging Elements   Total  respondents (out of 167 responses)      Title   166     URL   163     Date of last update   160     Author/Creator   157     Subject keywords   157     Language   156     Time period covered by resource   156     Date resource created   150     Genre   144     Publisher   141     Copyright/access rights   141     Subject controlled vocabulary   141     Relation to other works   140     Link to index/keyword search of resource      138     Format   138     Geographic coverage   134     Summary of resource (by librarian)   130     Other identifying numbers (e.g. ISSN, GPO)   129     Link to Tables of contents   126     Summary of resource (by publisher)   119     Statement that resource is peer-reviewed [13]   112            Indeed, we might note that each element on the survey was considered ""essential"" by at least some respondents; the element that was selected as ""essential"" the fewest number of times was a "" link to or excerpt of a review of the resource"" (10 responses). The element selected most often as ""not important"" was ""subject classification code"" (23 responses).      Elements which were selected as ""essential"" or ""often useful"" by less than two-thirds of the respondents included:            excerpts or links to reviews of the resource (95)      place of publication (90)       subject classification codes such as LC or Dewey (79)        One thing that was somewhat surprising to us in looking at the above lists was the relatively low ranking of controlled subject vocabulary[14] compared to subject keywords, particularly since the need for controlled vocabulary was emphasized in the free text comments of just under a quarter of the respondents. In general, we found few differences among the responses in this regard given by librarians by type or size of library, those having more years service as reference providers, with the percentages of respondents rating controlled vocabulary as either essential or often useful hovering around two-thirds for most of these categories. The most pronounced differences appeared among those eighty-six respondents doing concentrated searching in the sciences and technology, where only fifty-three percent indicated controlled subject vocabulary was ""essential"" or ""often useful""; the forty federal and state governmental librarians where eighty-two percent ranked ""controlled subject vocabulary as ""essential"" or ""often useful,"" and the ""metadata aware"" group of respondents, in which ninety percent of respondents in this category selected controlled subjects as ""essential"" or ""often useful.""     The comments of a few who did not rate controlled subject vocabulary as essential suggest that for some at least, it may be a matter of settling for what they view as practical.      Just getting a brief title and keyword record into the catalog would be better than it is now.     I would like speedy cataloging with minimal information.     Several other comments suggested that controlled subject headings broadly applied to resources as a whole cannot make the fine distinctions needed by patrons to focus in on their specific subjects:     And even if we catalog the web site, will the subject headings assigned be extensive enough to make it clear that the ""Voice of the Shuttle: [Web page for Humanities Research"" ( http://vos.ucsb.edu/  )] is a good place to go for links to William Blake, and any other individual author for that matter? This is doubtful. A major search engine would pick this up though.      Additional descriptive elements cited by reference providers       Respondents were also given the opportunity to list additional cataloging elements which they considered to be essential, for searching, or for viewing on the record, or for accessing directly from the record.[15] In some cases respondents expanded on the kinds of information needed in relation to elements in included in our list and we include that information here as well.

Resource Description              - presence of images, sounds, text, data, graphics, video clips, etc.                  - size of document/site; downloading information                  - formats available (e.g. .pdf)              Relation to other works              - specify if content is full text or full image. Note if portions of ""full text"" resources actually omit certain types of materials. (A ds, graphics, etc)              - note where indexed - including non-electronic indexes.          - enhancement of online version (multimedia, reference linking, etc.)             Optimum ""levels"" of library and metadata descriptions:      With regard to the ""level"" of cataloging needed for these resources, it would seem that the above results indicate that a majority of those responding see a need for description that could be accommodated at the level provided by a ""Dublin Core""-like model. All of the elements listed in tables 1 and 2 can be accommodated by Dublin Core[16] and its qualifiers to distinguish between elements that may be repeated with distinct types of data: such as date created and date updated; subject keywords and controlled subject vocabulary; various identifiers such as URL's, ISSN's and descriptions containing tables of contents versus those containing summaries or other descriptive information. Looking at the elements which were added by respondents as ""essential,"" we see a number that could be accommodated by Dublin Core, as well.     These results also appear to be consistent with Lundgren and Simpson's survey of graduate students regarding their need for various cataloging elements for the description on Internet resources.[17] In that study title, primary author, Internet address, and summary were ranked highest, followed by subject, level of information, titles of related works in print, date created, date updated, access limits, additional authors, recommended software, system requirements, size of file, edition, frequency, and inclusion of graphics.     Print and Online: One Record or Two      Another section of the survey which produced many, many comments related to the problem highlighted by Michael Kaplan [18] in his paper for the conference of single versus multiple records for works appearing in multiple formats: the following librarian perhaps put it most forcefully:     Multiple formats for a single serial title result in much confusion for patrons. Many give up rather than search through multiple records to find what they need .... there is great need for consolidating access to different versions or formats for serial titles. Our catalogers are ""purists"" and want a clean database that will migrate well, but this does not make for a user friendly catalog. We often see 8 to 10 record[s] for the same title: microfilm, microfiche, microcard, online, paper, title changes, etc., etc. Please help!      Trying to balance the strong public service voice for a single record for multiple formats with the technological realities of computer-to computer data interchange of aggregator-supplied data so well described by Kaplan (a method which appears to offer some solution to the equally strong public service call for help in supplying title access in the OPAC to aggregator-supplied titles[19]), a number of our respondents urged that someone find a way, as one put it, to: figure out some way to maintain a clean database to make the catalogers happy and make it user friendly for patrons. Be able to hang multiple formats and holdings information on a single record.""     There should be a way for local control of ""holdings"" within the authority [master] record     Thus, we strongly second the similar suggestion made by Kaplan and urge that an effort be made to develop a means by which records can be merged ""for the public view that are kept separate in the technical services components of our catalogs.""[20]        Improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies         Survey-respondents were also asked to respond to an open-ended question regarding problems which might be addressed through improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies. Before looking at some of the specific problems raised and the suggestions which our respondents made, we would like to return to the question raised by the Alternative Architecture thread of the conference listserv. Should these resources be in the OPAC at all? Even as reference librarians pointed out over and over again some of the problems of adding Internet resources to the OPAC cited in Barbara Baruth's  American Libraries  article,[21] the majority also made it that they thought selected Internet resources had their place in the OPAC. However, looking at many of the comments supporting the inclusion of these resources in the OPAC, we see one theme emerging over and over again: a unified search interface that is clear and easy to use.        Again, having one place to search that would include relevant resources would make research less fragmented.     In my opinion, it would be better to go to one place (the OPAC) for all resources, rather than to have to search the OPAC for other materials and then hunt for Internet resources by browsing through extensive ""webliographies.""     I'd rather have our users have a seamless way of searching for information...     [The interface for accessing networked resources is a problem because of] lack of ease of use. Simple, easy and familiar are VERY critical and are not there yet.      [Access to free Internet resources is a problem because] they are scattered over a variety of access points. For example, some in bookmarks, some in classroom handouts, others in general subject pages.       We bring these examples up because some of the solutions offered by our respondents actually suggest a more distributed approach, which might well be consistent with Barbara Baruth's observation: ""The future of library systems architecture rests in the development of umbrella software that digests search results from rapid, coordinated searches of a variety of disparate databases-OPACs of locally-held print and audiovisual materials, union catalogs, consortial catalogs of e-books and journals, and specialized digital library collections.""[22]      This sounds similar to us to Kaplan's observation that ""we are beginning to see the development of search interfaces and search engines that will simultaneously search and unify heterogeneous databases consisting of MARC records in all the bibliographic formats, as well as databases comprising all present and future data structures: Dublin Core, EAD, TEI, CIMI, VRA Core, MAB, MAB2, etc.,""[23] and Calhoun's discussion of ""the need to be able to manage loosely federated data from many sources.""[24]     We might note in passing that the concept of using ""simultaneous"" automated searches of multiple databases is under active consideration by the LC-led Collaborative Digital Reference Service (CDRS) project.[25] A recent proposal by Donna Dinberg (National Library of Canada) to the DigiRef team, would make use of captured metadata from bibliographic citations included in responses to users' inquiries to generate automatic searches of appropriate catalogs and databases through the use of Z39.50 protocols, ultimately allowing users to determine local  availability of the materials cited and to initiate a loan or document delivery request, if desired.[26]   Comments from some of our respondents include:         [ I ] would like a more ""relational"" approach. Example, a subject search would bring up a result that includes categories such as 1. [Library Name] Materials, 2. Free Internet Resources, 3. Fee-Based Online Resources, etc.     [There is a need for ] unified searching; cross-platform searching.     We need more automated linages between our Web guides and our online catalog.      .... If the descriptions are part of a federated system where the builders of discovery and access mechanisms have no control over metadata content, there may still be some value in building a search tool that propagates multiple search terms from a single term based on the term variants or equivalents listed in one or more established structures such as authority files or thesauri ... In the best of all possible RDF worlds, a discovery tool should be able to convert a user input search term into the normative form of the term for a given set of metadata, based on the coding of the description itself and offer manipulation of the full panoply of syndetic relationships offered by that particular normative form upon request.     Map specialized vocabularies at the highest level of the hierarchy, e.g. Transportation thesaurus would be mapped to LCSH for general transportation terms such as ""Transportation,"" ""Vehicles, etc."" the user would be alerted to the fact that the data received is from a non-LC collection, in this case the Dept. of Transportation data. The user would be given the option to enter into the specialized database on transportation or remain in the LC online catalog to continue a search.       Many other comments, which may or may not be applicable to searching distributed databases, clearly move beyond manual cataloging of Internet resources in the OPAC to talk about incorporating various automated solutions into the mix. Such comments focused on some of the following problems:      On the ""disappearing"" web:       Perhaps indexed metadata might include ""control numbers"" keyed to URL/path so when harvesters build indexes, any metadata value that returns a 404 error produces a mechanism for that search engine to remove all index terms built from metadata in that control number.     Retrieve ""close matches"" when 404 error occurs, possibly by truncating the search to the ""root"" URL     Additional use of URL and content checking software; perhaps with automated notification service - or even better - automated updating of the metadata record.      More use of unique identifiers for identification of electronic resources; greater use of PURLs or similar technology plus greater use of automated link checking tools.      Archive resources ""of research value""; provide ""traditional"" cataloging only for archived resources.    On Copyright issues:       Set up a system like music played on the radio where any station can play anything and have a formula whereby copyright holders get paid reasonably, but there is little administrative burden on the patron     For issues of copyright, see Mike O'Donnell's paper presented at the May 2000 National Online meeting, where he discusses a proposal for an IP (Intellectual Property) meter. Clicking on (c) symbol would show the information needed to license the content, including ""who owns the material and who publishes the material,"" along with the ""permissions, i.e., ""how the content may be used and what it will cost, ....[ and] the terms of use.""[27] All of this is managed by a copyright clearing house which collects any fees, sends the payments to the publisher with info on who licensed the content, and supplies content to purchaser with a digital marking showing the original source.       Enhanced searching       Enhance existing search engine technology to move beyond matching strings of characters to search concepts or meaning as well through techniques such as disambiguation, contextual and grammatical parsing and use of semantic networks to increase precision.     The ability to fine-tune a search, using such methods as frequency of words or location of words and element identification (such as author, title)     ... better or more exacting search engines within huge searchable databases [would be useful]. I'm not speaking of big search engines like Google, but using this kind of power in smaller subsets like newspaper archives, etc.     Study how nonlibrarian users do their searching.    On use of metatags:         Require records management/life cycle controls (metadata fields) on anything added to a library catalog or web page. Unfortunately, this means you'd lose a lot of good information offered for free but if pushed for in quality publishing circles, [this] might be a selection criteria that might drive the market...       Issuing agencies should include in their metadata the agency name, using a standardized format and they should use controlled subject headings to describe the resource.        Use XML to create specialized tags for necessary data such as author and title. However, I would also want the metadata to be visible to the user so that the information could be used to construct better searches later.       If metatag information was more rule-based, as in standard library cataloging, changes in resource URL's would be less of a problem. Searches on resources that use consistent metadata would have repeatable results regardless of some types of changes now inherent in the web.     Work with selected publishers providing them with  librarian-created  metadata which they could add to the headers of their resources.    On controlled vocabulary:        Ideally it would be beneficial if the ""natural language"" type of search could somehow be automatically screened through an ""authority file"" to eliminate large numbers of false drops. For example, I want material on housebreaking my dog. If as a patron I could type in housebreaking dogs and receive only results on ""dogs- habits & behaviors"" (or whatever the current ""official subject heading"" is) I would probably be happier with the result of my search query.     Among the most expansive and thorough responses to this question were those provided by Gerry McKiernan, Science and Technology Librarian at Iowa State University, curator of Cyberstacks, and field editor for the  Journal of Internet Cataloging . His response to this question on the survey was a referral to his 1999 article in the  Journal of Internet Cataloging [28] and to related resources cited on his web page.[29] In these sources McKiernan refers to a number of projects to facilitate access to relevant Web resources including the use of intelligent agents,[30] automated categorization of Web resources, such as OCLC's Scorpion technology used in its CORC project[31]; information visualization technologies such as the SPIRE(tm) suite of information access and visual analysis tools developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;[32] and natural language processing programs such as DR. LINK and KNOW-IT of MNIS-TextWise Labs.[33]     We believe that what the above responses suggest is that many public service staff recognize, as Michael Kaplan said in his paper for this conference, that we  are  ""really, really drowning"" in the sea of electronic resources[34], and carefully hand-crafted records for each, is an impossible dream. We need whatever help technology can give us, and we as a profession need to maintain awareness of the possibilities of current research and openly communicate and work with researchers in these areas if these problems are to be solved.      Concluding thought     In conclusion, we might note another theme that surfaced both at the ALA 2000 meeting and in the comments portion of the survey relating to the interaction of public service and technical services staff and departments. On the one hand there was clear evidence of the walls that have grown between reference and technical services, as reflected in the following comments:       It's unfortunate that the structure of our libraries into public and technical services units inhibits communications between reference librarians and cataloguers. This survey should not be about ""my wishes."" It should be about a real conversation that has to go on in the library.     On the other hand, there were also signs of the breakdown of those walls in some places, which librarians described both at the open meeting at the American Library Association Annual Meeting in July 2000 and in comments on the survey. Whether through participation in CORC[35] or through other homegrown efforts at collaborative work between public and technical services in the selection and bibliographic control of web resources[36], these projects easily fit within the framework described by Karen Calhoun in her paper for this conference of the ""typical"" progress of a new electronic resource through the ""resource description"" process at many institutions.[37] Even where there was no collaboration mentioned, there were many comments calling for increased communication between the two departments. In this regard, we found our survey results to be very consistent with proposals put forward by Karen Calhoun on the redesign of library workflows within institutions, making increased use of cross-functional virtual teams for the selection and cataloging of networked resources.     Finally, we would like to point out one additional characteristic of our respondents which we think speaks directly to this point and clearly reflects the importance of the topic of this conference to reference providers. In response to the concluding question on the survey asking respondents to leave their email address or other contact information if they wished to receive additional information about the results of the survey or the Bicentennial Conference, one hundred and nine respondents did so. When was the last time you asked a survey-taker to keep in touch? Clearly, there is interest and concern about this topic in the reference community.                    Notes:         Because of incomplete and inconsistent data for some institutions along with variations in the number and size of institutions in each state,  ""small,"" ""medium,"" and ""large"" were loosely defined, and varied somewhat from state to state and by type of library. Generally, we began by looking at the U.S. D.O.E. data for each state and trying to select one institution with numbers falling in the top quarter, one from the bottom quarter, and one from the midrange of the data available for that particular state, supplementing this information with other sources as necessary.    Respondents were asked to rank their knowledge of the following according to these choices: ""Have used or have substantial knowledge,"" ""Have a general understanding,"" ""Recognize the name only,"" or ""Have never heard of it"": Extensible Markup Language (XML), Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Resource Description Framework (RDF), Dublin Core (DC), Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), Text encoding Initiative, (TEI), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC), Consortium for the computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI), Scout Report Signpost, and Jointly Administered Knowledge Environment (jake).    CORC , XML, SGML, Dublin Core, and Scout Signpost.    Only for the category ""online library catalogs"" did a majority report that they consulted them ""about the same"" as a year ago.

At the LC-sponsored open meeting on this topic at the American Library Association Annual Meeting (July 2000) several college and university librarians stressed that information indicating that articles in a title are ""peer-reviewed"" is indispensable in an academic setting; and indeed, among those respondents from academic institutions, just under two thirds (56)  indicated this piece of information was either essential or often useful    Eighty-four percent of the respondents indicated that it is essential or ""often useful"" for controlled subject to appear on the catalog record for networked resources compared to ninety-four percent selecting ""essential"" or ""often useful"" for subject keywords.    As one respondent said: ""I am assuming that ... clicking onto one of the elements [in the bibliographic description] will take you to a page that will have many of the elements I marked as being 'not essential.'

AI's greatest value is automating and increasing the      utilization of expert or organizational knowledge (i.e., knowing what to do      with given information or circumstances). Although AI technology is still      in its early stages of development, many spectacular success stories in both      military and major corporation applications serve as testimonials to AI's      potential. The best AI systems save companies and the government millions      of dollars a year.      The United States leads the world in nearly all aspects of AI technology,      largely due to over 30 years of patronage by the Department of Defense (DoD).      Currently, the United States alone accounts for over 60 percent of an estimated      $900 million global AI market. Cutting edge (usually very expensive) AI applications,      accounting for almost two-thirds of the U.S. market, are normally developed      internally by DoD and a handful of major corporations (mostly) in the information      technology field (AT&T, DEC, IBM, Apple, Intel, etc.).     More mature and proven AI technologies are packaged and marketed by merchant      vendors. Most merchant AI systems are small in scope, and range in price from      about $100 to $250,000. An estimated 70-80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies      use AI technology to varying degrees. The merchant market, comprising about      one-third of the global market, is intensely competitive and innovative, but      not profitable. Between 1988-1993, merchant revenues more than doubled. However,      vendors came and went by the dozens. About five or six leaders have emerged,      but in 1993 only one had sales of over $40 million.      The United States leadership position in AI is eroding as the governments      and companies in Japan, and as well as in Western European, working together,      have gained ground. In select areas of AI, Japan and Western Europe now surpass      the U.S. Two major conditions threaten the country's leading position: 1)      the slow rate of AI commercialization relative to extensive research and development      expenditures, and 2) declines in Defense research and development funding.      Cuts in the military budget have reduced overall AI R&D, shifted research      away from basic science and long-term projects, and threaten to delay AI's      potential from being realized. The commercial sector will not come close to      replacing these lost R&D funds, particularly at the basic research level.         The establishment of an AI experts group, with industry, academic, and government      participation (representing commercial and defense interests), is needed to      provide focus and direction to AI R&D and commercialization issues.     Background     This AI assessment was undertaken under the Defense Authorization Act for      Fiscal Years 1991 (Public Law No. 101-310, Section 825) and the National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law No. 102-484, Section 4215).      This legislation requires the Departments of Defense and Commerce (acting      through the Under Secretary for Export Administration) to submit reports to      the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives      on the status of technologies deemed essential to the performance of current      and next generation weapon systems, and crucial to the commercial sector's      ability to compete in the global economy.      The goal of this assessment is to provide industry executives and government      policy makers with comprehensive information and analysis about research into      and production and application of AI technologies in the military and the      U.S. economy. This includes analysis of the economic performance and international      competitiveness of private sector firms and academic institutions involved      in the creation, distribution, and use of AI, and the impact declining defense      budgets have on the technology. In achieving this goal, the Department of      Commerce's Office of Industrial Resource Administration (OIRA) collected information      from the public and private sectors with a survey questionnaire and sought      expert advice as necessary.     What is AI?     AI refers to highly engineered computer software programs used to make computers      do things that appear intelligent - such as reason, learn, create, understand      human speech, or solve problems. As a science, AI studies the nature of intelligence,      and tries to make computers simulate intelligent behavior. As a technology,      AI is used to automate (or extract and synthesize) knowledge from information      and databases. AI has evolved into many specialized areas and approaches.      Major areas and sub-areas of AI research include:                      automatic programming           knowledge representation           planning                      decision making         knowledge acquisition         robotics                      expert data base systems         logic programming         search                      expert systems         machine learning         speech recognition                      fuzzy logic         natural language processing         theorem proving                      game playing         neural networks         uncertainty                      general problem solving                   understanding systems                      intelligent computer-aided instruction                   vision               (See Appendix A for definitions.)     AI systems can today: 1) help organizations manage knowledge assets and deal      with complexity; 2) help experts solve difficult analysis problems and design      new devices, 3) learn from examples; and 4) provide answers to English questions      using both structured data and free text.      Major AI Technology Applications      AI is a dual-use technology. The same AI system shells or tools can be readily      applied across most military and civilian applications. In terms of sales,      the most successful and dominant AI tools to date have included knowledge-based      systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and natural language systems.      In 1993, the global market for AI systems was estimated at about $900 million.      The North American (NA) portion of the global market was roughly $600 million      of this total. Slightly over $200 million of the NA portion, or about one-third,      was sales and license fees collected by AI vendors (the merchant market).      An estimated 20-30 percent of this merchant market was exported. Major AI      tools include the following:     Knowledge-based (or expert) systems (KBS) have experienced the most commercial      success to date. They are used for diagnostic, scheduling, planning, data      synthesis, and tutoring purposes, and for automating manuals and running factories.      The NA market for KBS totaled an estimated $350 million in 1993. This included      estimates of $171 million developed internally by corporations, about $30      million for off-the-shelf systems and embedded components, and $150 million      in AI vendor sales and licensing fees.      Neural networks were long neglected, but are projected to grow at a fast      rate in the next decade, and perhaps overtake KBS systems. Neural networks      efficiently handle huge databases. They are exceptionally good at pattern      recognition. Neural network systems are used by the brokerage houses to predict      stock fluctuations, by banks to detect fraud, by insurance companies to appraise      applicants, and are finding their way into the factory, where, for example,      they can sort fruit at incredible speeds. Neural networks and fuzzy logic      systems lumped together totaled $150 million in 1993. Neural net vendor revenues      totaled about $26 million, and fuzzy logic vendors' about $6 million. As the      numbers attest, the bulk of these systems were developed internally by government      and corporations, or used as embedded components in other software programs.     Fuzzy logic is the latest rage, although total sales are still small. Invented      in America 30 years ago, the Japanese embraced the technique and now lead      the world in nearly all aspects of fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is used mostly      as a control mechanism in camcorders, anti-lock braking systems, elevators,      transmission controls, washing machines, and many other products.      Natural language systems (NLS), particularly speech recognition, have benefited      from significant recent advances in the technology. NLS systems are used to      interface between humans and machines, and to allow human-machine communication      in English in place of a rigid set of commands. This includes two-way communication.      Using NLS, a manager can dictate a letter into a machine and have it printed      or simply transmitted (paperless option) across the country. The NLS market      was estimated at $64 million in 1993.     AI: A Part of the Emerging Knowledge Automation Industry     AI is not a ""stand-alone"" technology, and to an extent has lost identity      as a distinct product in the marketplace. The technology is increasingly embedded      or integrated in multi-purpose software packages where it can, for example,      increase the productivity, performance, and user friendliness of the package.      As an emerging technology with customized applications across the economy,      AI is difficult to define as a distinct industry. Based on what it does, however,      AI is combining with several other software technologies and emerging as the       Knowledge Automation Industry . This industry is an important component      of the rapidly expanding information age, playing a unique role in automating      the process of converting information into knowledge.      Components of the Knowledge Automation Industry     (A software industry that facilitates and improves the ability      to leverage the value of an organization's in-house knowledge and experience.)     Artificial Intelligence makes -- it easier to manage knowledge and experience      assets      Object Oriented Programming -- makes it easier to manipulate code     Computer Assisted Software Engineering -- makes it easier to manage software      development     Client-Server Networks -- makes it easier to connect people and computers      in an organization and promotes teamwork     The AI sector can be divided into three overlapping components. These are      research, commercialization, and applications. The research component is predominantly      funded by the Federal Government. The commercialization component transfers      the technology to end-users for a price, or more often, a cost if done internally.      The applications component is made up of customers -- the businesses and government      agencies that purchase AI technology packaged in a variety of ways. Its true      value lies in the increased competitiveness conferred on businesses using      the technology. This value is difficult to quantify, but substantial.      Research Component - Total research has hovered just above $200 million per      year since 1990. The top five research organizations represent almost 40 percent      of all AI research and over 50 percent of total basic research in AI in the      United States. In terms of research capabilities, the United States is preeminent,      but several foreign schools (e.g., University of Edinburgh) and companies      (e.g., Siemens) are the equal of the best research organizations in the United      States.      The Federal Government sponsored 75 percent (about $150 million per annum)      of the AI research in the United States between 1989-1994. Over 80 percent      ($125 million per annum) of the Federal total came from the Defense Department.      The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has been the champion of AI research      and development almost from the Agency's inception in 1958.      In the past few years, pressures mounted within the Defense community to      show results amid declining defense budgets. As a result, basic research,      which accounted for about half of total research expenditures in 1993, is      on the decline relative to applied research and development. Basic research      is categorized as high-risk, long-term and is often the first area to be cut      when budgets and priorities tighten. U.S. businesses sponsored about 15-20      percent of the research, while funding from foreign sources accounted for      most of the remainder.     The share of overall AI research undertaken by universities and firms is      about equal. Private internal research, which is more focused on short-term      applied research and development, could not be quantified, but may range from      $50-100 million. This research is undertaken by major corporations involved      in the information technologies (AT&T, IBM, Intel, etc.).     Commercialization Component - The merchant market is intensely competitive      in marketing primarily proven AI technologies. Most AI vendors are small and      entry into the business is low cost. Because of easy entry, the market is      perhaps overpopulated. Most vendors lodge themselves in a ""niche"" where they      try to survive. Many have gone out of business while others continue entering      the business. The largest vendor had sales of less than $50 million in 1993.     The overall AI market (merchant and internal development) has a high and      low end. The high end or leading edge of the industry develops highly sophisticated      AI systems that often merge the best of several AI technologies into a single      system. These systems are super-engineered expert systems that in a very real      sense exhibit capabilities near the human expert level. Leading-edge AI systems      are typically developed for and often by major corporations, or the Department      of Defense and other large organizations where the savings and productivity      opportunities are the greatest. The development of leading-edge systems frequently      includes university or think tank participation.     The lower end of the market, the merchant market, is comprised mostly of      AI vendors marketing prepackaged proven AI technologies. The AI tools range      from simple to complex, are usually inexpensive and, as with advanced systems,      can include several integrated AI techniques. An AI vendor may simply sell      or license an empty ""shell"" (or programming format). Vendors typically also      offer development services at the customer's option.      With some notable individual company exceptions, the merchant market has      not been profitable. Survey respondents as a group for the years 1989-92 showed      profits in only one year, 1990. Total revenue for the four year period totaled      more than $224 million, with losses of about $11 million. Much of the loss      was due to the collapse of the mainframe business. To supplement the survey      data, a review of the financial statements of four major publicly held AI      vendors (not part of the survey sample) from 1988-1993 provided a similar      picture of the financial difficulties many AI vendors have experienced. Total      revenues by the four during the 6-year period were $473 million. Losses on      those revenues were $106 million (i.e., a net loss of 22 percent). The financial      health of the entire industry should improve over the next few years as market      conditions improve. AI techniques are being integrated with other software      (client-server, object oriented programming) as these vendors adapt to the      changing needs of corporate computing.      Applications Component - Military        -  The Department of Defense is by far the      single largest user of AI in the world. In using AI as a strategic asset and      management tool, the military has demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,      pushed its development, and, through its use, improved military effectiveness.      The military uses AI systems for diagnostics, testing, robotics, target recognition,      tutoring, war planning, logistics, nuclear test-ban monitoring, database management,      and defense- related manufacturing.      Expert diagnostic systems are used extensively by the military to troubleshoot,      and maintain military equipment operational. An important value of these systems      is facilitating repairs by non-experts on equipment that otherwise could be      out of commission for extended periods. The military has also been the major      sponsor of research and development in the robotics and machine vision areas      of AI. Major projects include autonomous land and aircraft vehicles, automatic      target recognition systems, sonar discrimination systems, and navigation aids.     AI systems proved their strategic value in support of operations Desert Shield      and Desert Storm. For example,  DART  (Dynamic Analysis and Replanning      Tool) solved the logistical nightmare of moving the U.S. military assets to      the Saudi Desert. The application was developed to schedule the transportation      of all U.S. personnel and materials such as vehicles, food, and ammunition      from Europe to Saudi Arabia. This one application alone reportedly more than      offset all the money the Advanced Research Projects Agency had funneled into      AI research in the last 30 years.     Another example is  AALPS  (Automated Airload Planning System), a military      airlift load planner used by the Army and Air Force to maintain the aircraft's      center of gravity, through evaluation of the shape and weight of each piece      of cargo.  AALPS  was designed using a graphical interface depicting      the aircraft, and point and click-on icon representations of helicopters,      trucks, and other cargo are used to position cargo in the aircraft hold.  AALPS       reduced the time required to generate and modify cargo loads from about a      week to about one hour.     AI is also used to monitor the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty through an intelligent      system, IMS (Intelligent Monitoring System), that automatically detects, locates      and identifies underground nuclear tests. It incorporates expert systems,      fuzzy logic, neural networks and semi-automated knowledge acquisition.     Applications Component - Commercial        - The profile of use in the private sector is different from the military.      Where the military community develops a very large and expensive AI system      from beginning to end to meet a particular objective, the commercial sector      uses more off the shelf, less expensive AI systems to help them achieve more      micro-efficiency objectives. AI technology is used in virtually every sector      of the commercial economy. About 70-80 percent of the Fortune 500 firms now      use AI to varying degrees. Major application areas are in manufacturing, diagnostics,      tutoring, financial services, transportation, and data management.     The most applications (about 25 percent) were reported in the manufacturing      sector. These included applications in the chemical, steel, auto, electronics,      computer, aerospace, and plastics industries. They involved design and engineering,      process control, scheduling and planning, part making, factory automation,      inspection, and monitoring. AI is also a core technology used in computer      integrated manufacturing. In the data management area, for example, an AI      program automatically processes and indexes news wires into almost 700 categories      for Reuters News Service. For this system alone, savings were estimated at      more than $1.25 million in a recent year.     Another major commercial category is diagnostics and testing. Diagnostic      systems are used to examine aircraft engines, human hearing, telephone networks,      manufacturing machinery and other types of equipment, energy pipelines, ground      water and hazardous materials.     A third major segment is transportation services. AI is utilized for traffic      management systems, aircraft maintenance operations, airport gate scheduling,      railroad planning and forecasting and barge to tow boat assignments. These      AI systems are used to manage and draw optimal scheduling decisions from large      volume, complex and dynamic databases that would overwhelm human beings.     AI has improved the competitiveness of its commercial users by increasing      productivity, improving quality, and augmenting marketing. It has also expanded      user capabilities and task performance in ways not previously feasible. It      can also induce faster, more consistent and accurate communications, improve      service, and improve such intangibles as company or organizational images      and customer satisfaction.     AI Technology: A Long Range Perspective     AI technology is a small, but influential part of the much larger general      software industry. It represents the leading edge of computer software. AI      research undertaken years ago has contributed a great deal to the usefulness      of today's conventional software. For example, AI research in the 1960s and      1970s was directly responsible for windowing, spreadsheets, e-mail, spell-checkers,      chess programs, and many other system components.      AI is still an emerging technology. Continued research is essential to its      long-term development. While many AI techniques have attained commercial viability,      improvements are needed to further expand markets. In other cases, such as      machine learning and robotics, major research remains undone.      Three major points need to be understood about AI as an emerging technology.      First, it is revolutionary in that it potentially raises productivity 10-fold      or more, and requires many changes in the mind-set of management and people      using it. It can, therefore, have an enormous impact on international competitiveness.      Second, as an emerging technology, AI requires sustained long-term research.      However, AI lacks a solid constituency (critical mass) in the commercial market      to support that research. Federal leadership and patronage, critical to AI's      long-term development, is declining primarily due to DOD spending cuts.     Third, AI is experiencing market acceptance problems. It can take a major      education effort to introduce a new technology, which from a vendor's standpoint      means extensive customer consultations, and salesmanship. From a customer's      standpoint it means investment in worker training and equipment. If the AI      technology is revolutionary, it may even entail a re-engineering of entire      business organizations, and require an often unwelcome paradigm shift in the      thinking of business management.      Lack of market acceptance is also partly related to the fact that AI technology      came out of the laboratory before the corporate computing world was ready.      In 1980, corporate computing was mainframe based, centrally controlled, and      focused on accounting and payroll. Early AI vendors tried to get corporate      computing management to re-engineer the way they used these systems before      corporate managers understood the dramatic changes taking place in computer      technology. However, advances in computer technology have forced change. Now      corporate computing is becoming multi-platformed, decentralized, and involved      in every facet of the business. This change is favorable to the use of AI      systems and the other components of the knowledge automation industry.     Government Role     As previously noted, the Federal Government, notably DoD, has played the      preeminent role in the development and commercialization of AI technology.      In the future, as AI technology becomes more a part of mainstream software      and simpler to use, non-Defense agencies can be expected to increase their      use of AI relative to Defense usage. However, Defense will remain the major      user for the foreseeable future. Perhaps more importantly, Defense will continue      taking AI technology out of the lab and fielding first time applications.     The government's role can be divided generally into four elements --      1)   Fund Research :        Sponsor funding for basic and applied research.      2) Purchase the Product :       Develop and deploy new and existing AI techniques that a) enable the government      to accomplish its mission; b) improve government efficiency and services to      the public; c) demonstrate the feasibility of the technology; and d) provide      an initial market for the private sector.      3) Manage Business Environment :       Provide legal, regulatory, and educational infrastructure to foster the development      and use of AI technologies.      4) Leverage Risk :       Provide leadership in promoting cooperative agreements. Promote dual use and      technology transfer to private sector and stimulate private investments in      new technologies.      Government Funded Research -  Universities  look to the Federal Government      for about 80 percent of their research funding. The surveyed universities      were in general agreement that the Government needs to continue funding basic      and applied AI research if the United States is to maintain its leading position.       AI companies  (about 75 percent of funding from USG) also look for the      Government to fund research. The consensus viewpoint of companies surveyed      is that the commercial sector will not pay for the required AI research, particularly      at the basic level; therefore, they look to the Government to fill that role.     Government AI Purchases - Statistics on the use of AI in the Government exist      only on an partial basis. Comprehensive data are not available, and no system      is in place to collect it. However, the Government is unmistakably the largest      single user of the technology. In so doing, the Government has contributed      steadily to AI's development as a commercial product. On numerous occasions      DoD has been the first user of new AI technology, demonstrating its feasibility.     Many government agencies, or bureaus within those agencies, have formalized      AI groups that understand the technology and actively promote the technology      transfer of AI within their areas. The U.S. Army has the largest such group      by far. The Army group, with several hundred people, has many ongoing AI projects.      One particularly impressive AI project is called  Blacksmith .  Blacksmith ,      which manages over a terabyte (trillion bytes) of data, is a management decision      tool that will enable military planners to simulate with high precision how      a change in policy, however large or small, will effect Army force structure      and capabilities throughout the world, and thus allow decisions to be made      with foreknowledge of the consequences.     The Navy and Air Force were slower to adopt the concept, but they now too      have such AI groups. Other agencies, such as NASA, the Internal Revenue Service,      Social Security Administration, National Library of Medicine, and FBI, to      name a few have also adopted the specialized group approach.      Defense Cutbacks     The DoD has long been the major patron of AI research, and the leading developer      and user of AI in the world. A decline in the Department's AI activities could      severely slow down basic and applied research as well as AI development. Such      a slowdown would adversely affect the long-term competitiveness of the United      States. A major concern is that as the Defense budget declines, other Federal      agencies will not take up the slack.     University AI labs and private think tanks will absorb the brunt of Defense      cutbacks in AI research. A major AI institution characterized federally funded      research as a national resource in terms of transfer of government supported      technology developments to the commercial sector. Projected downturns in DoD      R&D expenditures will impair technology transfer efforts in AI and many      other fields and, as a result, impact U.S. competitiveness.      Among AI companies, the most common impact of declining defense funding will      be registered as declines in sales to Defense (and to prime contractors).      Many AI vendors noted that defense sales have already declined, some sharply.      Other companies reported a negative impact on their research activities, and      on jobs. Some firms also reported the impact of Defense cuts would be minimal,      but added that there could be increased competition as firms shift from defense      to commercial sectors.     International      Standing     In 1993 the United States AI market was about twice the size of the rest      of the world combined. However, experts agree that this huge lead is diminishing      as other countries appear to be incorporating AI systems at a faster rate      than is occurring in the United States. Technology application appears to      be a key factor in the competitive world market. In this respect, other nations,      with stronger collaborative efforts between government, industry, and academia,      are doing a better job in applying AI technology than the United States.

This applies to consumer products,      the ability to integrate expert systems with conventional systems, the development      of very-large knowledge bases, and business-sector investment in knowledge-based      technology. Also, the United States is behind in the design of intelligent      computers which can ""reason"" over large volumes of data. In addition, the      United States lacks database, image, and software standardization, which is      having a mixed effect; it encourages versatility but discourages large cooperative      projects.     Universities also stated that the United States is behind Japanese production      of fuzzy logic hardware and software because of Japan's industrial policy,      investment environment, and pragmatic acceptance of unconventional technology.      Japan has an ""implementation based"" research community. Japan took the lead      in applying fuzzy systems theory to develop intelligent control systems, and      is advancing rapidly with industrial and commercial applications. American      institutions need to continue taking the lead in theory, but at the same time      develop new ways for turning theory into applications. According to the university      respondents, the United States is also beginning to fall behind Germany is      some areas of knowledge representation and reasoning.      U.S. AI firms responding to the OIRA survey had similar comments on overall      U.S. competitiveness. One company stated that, ""In the United States money      is spent on research that sits on the shelf."" Another company said, ""We are      falling behind because our government does not support the transfer of R&D      technology applications. This is especially serious with decreasing defense      spending."" Some firms noted that the United States is falling behind in the      use of AI by industry. Although we still lead in many manufacturing sectors,      the industry's reluctance to use new technology products will allow international      competitors to catch up with and overtake the United States.     Various companies reported that the United States is losing ground or is      now behind in certain aspects of robotics, neural networks, expert systems,      fuzzy logic, and machine learning. In machine learning, most of the key people      in inductive logic programming and first order concepts of learning are in      Europe and Australia, not in the United States.     Overall, U.S. universities and firms are in general agreement that the United      States is: 1) behind Japan in nearly all aspects of fuzzy logic; 2) losing      ground in generally all categories of AI research; 3) behind Europe in establishing      consortia; and 4) significantly behind the rest of the world in commercializing      AI technologies.      The Department of Commerce's Office of Foreign Availability (OFA) in the      Bureau of Export Administration provided a section for this assessment on      AI activities in foreign countries. The OFA report documented the partnerships      between government, industry, and academia in Europe and Japan that provide      the mechanisms for successfully commercializing new AI technology. For example,      the Europeans instituted the European Strategic Program for Research and Development      in Information Technology (ESPRIT) under which European Common Market nations      collectively sponsor research partnerships in AI and related technology. In      Japan, MITI recently established the 10-year Real World Computing (RWC) program      that will focus on optical computing, massively parallel processing, and neural      systems.      Conclusions     1. AI is an emerging technology of strategic importance to the military and      of increasing importance to the international competitiveness of U.S. corporations.     2. The U.S. leads the world in nearly all aspects of AI technology, largely      due to over 30 years of patronage by the Department of Defense.     3. AI systems, large and small, often result in a ten-fold or more productivity      increase. These increases are possible because knowledge (i.e., the ability      to take a specific action to achieve a goal on given information) is the most      underutilized asset in any organization. The best AI systems save companies      (and the government) millions of dollars a year.     4. Cutting the Defense budget has resulted in a smaller share of the research      dollar going to basic research for AI. It has also resulted in cuts in total      research that will not be made up by increases from other Federal agencies.      University AI labs and private think tanks will be primarily impacted by these      cuts.     5. The commercial sector will not support adequate basic AI research nor      form AI consortia without Federal involvement. Declining R&D spending      will have a negative effect on AI technology developments and, over the longer      term, U.S. competitiveness.     6. The slow rate of AI commercialization appears to be a weakness of America's      AI Industry. Japan and Western Europe, with stronger collaborative efforts      between government, industry, and academia appear to be commercializing and      incorporating AI systems at a faster rate then is occurring in the U.S.. This      is diminishing the U.S. lead in market share.     7. Corporate computing is shifting from centrally controlled mainframe based      to widely distributed multi-platform based. Knowledge automation of widely      scattered organization information is growing in importance and is stimulating      the market for AI technology.      8. Statistical tracking of AI is inadequate to develop informed policy options.     Recommendations           Federal leadership is needed in establishing an Artificial Intelligence        Experts Group, with industry, academic and government participation (representing        commercial and military interests) to provide stability, coordination, focus,        and direction to such issues as AI research and development funding, commercialization/technology        application, and software development productivity.              The AI Experts Group could also stimulate the formation of consortia and        regional labs to research, develop, and deploy AI technologies as well as        address the issue of finding and training qualified AI workers, an issue        that was raised by many AI companies and universities.             The Federal Government needs to strengthen its statistical tracking of        AI technology research and development expenditures and purchases of AI        systems by both the public and private sectors.                                                                       FOIA  |  Disclaimer     |  Privacy Notice  |  Information    Quality  |  Department of    Commerce  |  Contact    Us"

Activities could include customer contact, goal setting, problem escalation, etc.  Business process outsourcing (BPO) BPO involves outsourcing a business function previously supported within the organization to a third party. For example, outsourcing human resources to a firm handling recruiting, benefits administration and management, employee evaluation, payroll administration and hiring or downsizing. Usually, this is done through a combination of personnel and technology. Typical areas outsourced in this manner also include shipping and logistics, finance, tax management, audit, IT and real estate management.  Applications outsourcing Applications outsourcing includes outsourcing the development and maintenance of computer-based programs that serve business needs (as opposed to those software products managing the operating systems of hardware platforms and considered more technical) to a third party. Applications outsourcing can be performed on-site, off-site in a centralized facility, remotely or offshore.  Business-to-business (B2B) B2B e-commerce involves interactions and transactions between a company and its trading partners. These interactions and communications can take place via a value-added network (VAN) or proprietary connection, but more often take place via the Internet. Trading partners include suppliers, collaborators, subsidiaries and large institutional customers. B2B e-commerce applications can be highly automated, with very little human intervention involved, or users may conduct transactions with each other and the system via a user interface (which is typically a Web browser). B2B e-commerce applications require integration with at least one trading partner 's back-end system and may involve integration with multiple partners' systems. Examples of business-to-business ecommerce applications include vertical online marketplaces, B2B auctions, Web-based claims processing, collaborative planning and forecasting, order management and Internetbased procurement.  Application server A network-connected computer that is dedicated to performing processing for a designated application/series of applications.  Application service provider (ASP) With an ASP, applications outsourcing is done remotely, with a third party providing both the software application, the hardware required to support the application, the network components required to connect the business units to the outsourcer 's data center and delivery of that application and all the components required to run it over the Internet, usually for a fixed monthly fee based on the number of users.  Available to promise An order management or fulfillment technique that verifies that inventory is available before completing (""promising"") an order (and usually reserves the merchandise so that it cannot be allocated to another order).  Business-to-consumer (B2C) B2C e-commerce involves interactions and transactions between a company selling products and services over the Internet and consumers.  Business intelligence (BI) Business intelligence is typically embodied by tools for performing analysis - either ad hoc, planned or discovery-oriented, as in data mining - sometimes with a specific vertical flavor, and increasingly being delivered as analytic applications.  Business-to-enterprise (B2E) B2E concerns Web-based applications for conducting e-business that is largely internal and revolves around employees and managers as the primary user community. B2E includes corporate intranets, enterprise portal technology platforms and knowledge and content management technologies used for corporate communications, reporting and collaboration, as well as for administrative self-service applications, such as HR, payroll, benefits, time and attendance and expenses. Web-based HR and administrative self-service is not synonymous with B2E, but is a component of it.  Business process integration (BPI) The automated, intercompany exchange of process information that enables one organization to directly link its processes to those of another organization. BPI transactions are designed to streamline operations, reduce cost and improve customer service. BPI is an ""enabling"" tool - like electronic data interchange (EDI)- that supports data exchanges between applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM) or customer relationship management (CRM).  Call-me management Call-me management is Web technology (with underlying telephony support) that allows customers to request a phone callback from the Web. The callback can either be immediate or scheduled, and it is often automatically queued to phone  www.gigaweb.com page 2   2001 Giga Information Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Call-me support allows customers to request human assistance when necessary to complete their Web transaction or purchase.  the customer by name and that the customer doesn't have to repeat account or other identifying information.  Contact management Campaign management Campaign management is both a marketing activity and a category of software that helps plan marketing campaigns, target customers or prospects for those campaigns, deliver the campaigns and analyze campaign results. Benefits are typically measured in terms of number of leads generated (and cost per lead), as well as number of sales generated (and cost per sale). Contact management includes tools to enter and update customer or prospect information, such as name, phone number, company, role, interests, etc. Contact management is part of sales-force automation but can also be a category of more limited tools that primarily manage customer contacts, appointments and to-dos. The primary benefit is to help sales representatives remember and track customers and prospects. However, in a larger CRM implementation, it can also serve as important information for marketing, telesales or service employees contacting the company to help ensure consistency.  Case management (Also called problem management, problem tracking or case tracking). Case management is used to record and track customer-service requests, including status and resolution.  Content tagging This involves tagging content with metadata to leverage in browsable content directories and use for tracking, personalization and improved searching. Metadata tags are typically organized into taxonomies, which can represent content topics and types, business units, industry focus, geographies or a host of other attributes as driven by an organization and business goals.  Clickstream analysis Clickstream analysis uses customers' ""clicks"" on the Web site (pages visited, information requested, shopping cart abandoned) to better understand their behavior and interests. For example, customers who fill a shopping cart and then click on help and then abandon the shopping cart can be assumed to have been unable to resolve a problem with their order. Clickstream analysis can be used for many purposes, from site optimization (reducing the number of clicks to get customers to common tasks) to personalization (making promotional offers appropriate to what the customer appears to be looking for) to merchandise management (displaying slow moving items more prominently on the Web site).  Corporate connection register (CCR) The corporate connection register (CCR) defines all feeds to and from the asset management system.  Customer profile management Similar to contact management, customer profile management typically focuses more on categorizing customers and their interests. While profiles can be part of any number of CRM tools, they have taken on increased importance on the Web, where visitors are often prompted for interests or characteristics that can improve personalization.  Common information model (CIM) CIM is meant to serve as a universal model for managed objects. Conceptually, the model is object oriented and is presented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Divided into the CIM specification (language description, basic constructs and mappings to other managed object models) and the CIM schema (a three-layered attempt to actually model all possible managed objects utilizing the resources of the CIM specification), CIM is not meant to replace existing representations of managed objects (e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol management information bases -- SNMP MIBs, Desktop Management Task Force management information files -- DMTF MIFs) but rather to provide a lingua franca into which and out of which these representations might be translated.  Customer relationship management (CRM) Customer relationship management is not a product that can be bought off the shelf. Rather, CRM is the strategy, business processes and supporting technology to help a company and its partners acquire new customers, retain existing customers and maximize customer value. Initially automating internal sales (opportunity management, contact management) and service (problem tracking) processes, CRM is now extending out to manage selling partners (resellers, distributors), as well as field service and marketing (campaign management, corporate marketing) workers. With the advent of the Web, CRM systems are increasingly touching the customer directly, including Web product recommendations, customer self-service and e-mail and Web marketing applications.  Computer telephony integration (CTI) management Computer telephony integration (or CTI) is a fancy term for routing a telephone number for an incoming phone call to a computer so that the computer can ""pop"" a screen of customer information to the agent at the same time that the phone call arrives. The benefit is that the agent can address  www.gigaweb.com   2001 Giga Information Group Inc. All rights reserved.

It is sometimes done on-site, and the outsourcer brings its own staff and management methodologies and manages the customer facility at its location. In remote data center outsourcing, the customer owns no equipment and obtains MIPS, storage and tape, and perhaps voice and data networking, by sharing parts of a very large mainframe or server and disk drives with other customers at very large data center facilities located all over the world (IBM, EDS and CSC are leaders in this segment).  E-business Conducting any form of business activity over the Internet. Giga uses the term ""e-business"" to include e-commerce as well as other, internal uses of electronic network technologies.  E-collaboration Two-way, Internet-based data exchanges between people, applications or devices that are intended to improve the results of existing business processes.  E-commerce Conducting commercial activity over the Internet (buying and selling). A subset of e-business. Giga uses the term ""e-commerce"" to cover transaction-related interactions between a company and its external customers, customers or suppliers.  Data mining (DM) Data mining applies statistical algorithms to discover patterns in a firm's data. Once surfaced and identified, the meaning of these patterns can be interpreted for possible actionable business initiatives.  Desktop management interface (DMI) A framework created by the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) that defines specifications for industry-standard interfaces for instrumentation providers and management applications.  E-mail response management system (ERMS) ERMS is an automated process for receiving, routing and responding to e-mails -- either as a stand-alone system or fully integrated with a customer relationship management (CRM) application. To eliminate agent involvement in every incoming e-mail, these systems automate many processes previously performed manually by call center or support agents, freeing them up to handle more complex, or less routine, issues. ERMS capabilities break down into three main categories: auto-acknowledge, auto-response and auto-suggest.  Development chain optimization (DCO) DCO is decision-support software that supports and aids new product development by providing real-time, enterprisewide project and portfolio data and analysis.  E-procurement Direct connections An e-channel for Internet-based data exchanges that uses the EDI/INT protocol to ensure secure and reliable data transport. The terms e-procurement and Internet-based procurement are synonymous, with e-procurement becoming the more widely used term. E-procurement is a software application or a hosted service that helps companies automate and streamline their purchasing processes. To date, e-procurement has focused on operating resources purchases but is expanding to include direct materials. Using e-procurement solutions, requisitioners order goods and services directly from Web-based catalogs rather than filling out paper requests and sending them to an internal purchasing department. Catalog content can reside locally in a cross-supplier catalog on the buying organization's site, on supplier Web sites, or on content aggregation sites or online marketplaces. The catalog stores product data such as descriptions, pricing and part numbers, and features a shopping cart or order form and a search engine. If the catalog is tied into suppliers' systems, real-time pricing and inventory checking are possible. Via the e-procurement system's workflow capabilities, requisitions are automatically sent to suppliers or are routed to the appropriate management for approval. Orders are sent to suppliers via the Internet or some other mechanism.  Distributed technology absorption rate (DTAR) DTAR is used to identify and trend cultural barriers that exist to implementing and therefore optimally leveraging technology. DTAR should be an expected product of any asset management implementation.  Distributed technology figure (DTF) A ""horsepower"" rating of the intelligent technology deployed in the distributed infrastructure at the client and server.  E-agility The ability to respond to rapidly changing requirements to provide application functionality via the Internet. E-agility components consist of a compelling user interface, a strong systems infrastructure, a flexible systems architecture and the ability to rapidly integrate trading partners via the Internet.  www.gigaweb.com page 4   2001 Giga Information Group Inc.

EDI has traditionally been conducted over value-added networks (VANs), but it is gradually moving to the Internet. The most common EDI standards in use are ANSI X12 and UN EDIFACT.  enter into and also exit these arrangements. The economics dictate longer contracts if a company expects to save money.  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) The document format used on the World Wide Web. Web pages are built with HTML tags, or codes, embedded in the text. HTML defines the page layout, fonts and graphic elements as well as the hypertext links to other documents on the Web.  EDI e-mail A system for sending and receiving electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions based on in-network translation services provided by a third party and integration with a standard e-mail system such as Microsoft Outlook.  The Hyper Media Management Protocol (HMMP) HMMP is a proposal from the Web-based enterprise management (WBEM) initiative for a means to use Web browsers as an interface to management platforms and to have an open method of integrating management tools from various vendors.  EDI/INT A protocol developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to provide guidelines for the secure transport of electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions over the Internet.  Instant messaging (IM) Instant messaging involves short messages that are tactical in nature and usually entail the answering of a specific, timesensitive question. Instant messaging is usually deployed as a supplement to phone conversations and as an adjunct to email that is faster for both for creation of text (does not require addressing, formatting, etc.) and in response times.  Electronic trading networks (ETNs) Managed communications services hosted on the Internet by third-party providers. Subscribers pay fees for secure, reliable delivery of data exchanges. ETNs function as electronic hubs for routing data only. Unlike marketplaces, ETNs do not support commercial activity at the hub. They are strictly routers.  Interactive chat Interactive chat, or Web collaboration, allows customers to communicate with live agents by typing questions and responses into a window on the computer. Interactive chat is particularly helpful for home users who do not have a second phone line to talk to a live agent but need assistance to complete a Web transaction. Advanced features, such as Web cobrowsing (where the agent and the customer can control each other 's Web screen to help resolve problems), help agents show customers (rather than try to describe) screens, pictures or charts that can more quickly address questions. Most studies show that agents can handle two to three chat sessions concurrently (think time, transmission time), potentially making the agents more efficient.  Enterprise application integration (EAI) The process of connecting internal applications within the same organization.  Enterprise client device (ECD) An ECD is any computing device -- desktop, laptop or handheld -- that provides a user with access to business applications via a local area network (LAN) or otherwise.  Enterprise resource planning (ERP) ERP refers to an integrated system that encompasses the following functions: human resources, financials, manufacturing, sales automation and configuration, distribution, transportation, planning and the supply chain. These functions can be supplied through custom development, a single vendor or a best-of-breed strategy.  Interactive voice response (IVR) management IVR or interactive voice response is a technology that prompts customers for identifying information or call purpose prior to reaching a live agent. IVR can also provide telephone-based customer self-service, providing information on account balances, bill payment status, etc. IVR, sometimes in combination with voice recognition (so that customers can state their requests instead of navigating through numeric menus), helps offload routine requests from call center agents and also provides after-hours support to customers.  Full outsourcing In full outsourcing, the outsourcer manages all of IT, for example, including applications development and maintenance, computer operations and all Web operations, for a fee. This can be done on-site or remotely. Data center outsourcing and full outsourcing contracts are normally longer in duration (typically five to 10 years), because it is very complicated to  Internet service providers (ISPs) The first of the service providers (SPs), these are companies offering Internet access. There are still many companies in  www.gigaweb.com   2001 Giga Information Group Inc. All rights reserved.

For example, if they offer applications and own the license, the hardware and charge a per-seat/per-month basis, they have become application service providers (ASPs). If they don't own applications but do own data centers and hardware, they have become Web hosters. If they manage all of a customer 's deployment of these applications and guarantee service levels, they have become a managed service provider (MSP).  in a network, including the servers, and guarantee certain service levels.  Marketplaces/exchanges Electronic hubs designed to conduct commercial activity at the central location. The major types of marketplaces are private (typically set up by a larger company for dealing directly with its customers and suppliers), public (created by a third party to support commercial activity between buyers and sellers) and/or industry consortium (created by a group of leading companies to support commercial activity in a particular sector like automotive, electronics, etc).  IT outsourcing A subset of business process outsourcing (BPO), IT outsourcing is comprised of different offerings by many different outsourcers that offer to manage various components of IT.  Net present value (NPV) NPV is a metric that demonstrates a given investment's impact on cash flow projects. A company would project the stream of individual cash flows (both positive and negative) arising from each IT capital investment, discounting each individual cash flow by a factor dependent on the timing of the cash flow and some pre-established interest rate. The appropriately discounted individual cash flows for each investment would be added together to derive that investment's present value, and the investment with the highest present value would be chosen. NPV is widely accepted by theoreticians and practitioners despite the obvious weakness that its effectiveness is heavily dependent upon which interest rate is chosen.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) KPIs are the short list of measurable parameters that will indicate how well the firm is doing at attaining its goals. In a manufacturing process, this may be the amount of scrap or rework that gets metered. In insurance, this may be the open inventory of unprocessed claims. In brand management, market share in itself and in comparison with competing brands is sure to be relevant. In logistics, on-time deliveries, empty return loads or missing items are candidate indicators.  Knowledge management (KM) Knowledge management, from the software standpoint, includes any and all technologies that support human communication, capture human know-how, formally or informally, or assist in the coordination of human efforts between humans or humans and automation. It ranges from internal support (IS) and product help desks to sophisticated systems that monitor competitive positions.  Nonrepudiation The process of using auditing techniques to ensure the validity of an electronic document cannot be disputed.  Offshore outsourcing Offshore outsourcing is applications outsourcing provided by a global company off-site in another country. There has been a boom in these firms, many located in less costly regions of the world like India.  List management List management is the process of applying criteria (age, previous purchases, income) to generate a list of prospects for a marketing campaign (which are then provided to the campaign management or other software to generate letters or emails, or to the telemarketing call center for outbound phone calls). It often also includes list de-duplication and name/address cleansing (to ensure that lists are accurate and don't contain duplicates). Companies that do a lot of direct mail can save millions of dollars (and improve customer satisfaction and customer response rates) by using list management to send fewer pieces to better targeted prospects.  Portal A portal is the term commonly given to a Web interface that presents information and services (often from different underlying systems) to the user. Portals are intended to quickly and simply present just the information that is important, usually to a casual user, such as a customer or partner (providing a ""portal"" into the corporation), although they can also provide information to employees or managers.  Managed service providers (MSPs) MSPs are a class of companies (many of which evolved from application service providers, Internet service providers and Web hosters) offering to manage and monitor all components  Product/pricing configurator A product configurator allows customers, partners and employees to configure products and orders more accurately by tracking complex feature dependencies and pricing rules. These are traditionally used with complex physical products  www.gigaweb.com page 6   2001 Giga Information Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Sales-force automation (SFA) Sales-force automation is a system designed to provide a company's sales force with a way to track leads, sell products and manage ongoing relationships. Key features include: team selling, product recommendations and proposal generation, solution selling processes, forecasting, an integrated view of customer behavior, alerts and information filtering, advanced analysis, and synchronization across multiple sales regions or geographies.  Request for information (RFI) After an organization has made the decision to outsource and has established a list of potential providers of the services requested, the next step is to narrow this master list of providers down to the short list by evaluating the vendor responses to certain documents. An RFI is used when a company has a possible list of suppliers and would like to see a full portfolio of their service offerings; this is usually very much an exercise in marketing. At the conclusion of this stage, the vendors that cannot meet the company's requirements are eliminated from the list of possible suppliers. The RFI can be followed by either an RFP or an RFQ.  Sales funnel A sales funnel includes all opportunities currently in progress for a given sales representative, region or sales force ranked by sales opportunity stage. It is called a ""funnel"" because there are typically more opportunities at the top (prospecting, assessing customer interest) than there are at the bottom (proposed, closing). A sales funnel allows the sales rep to see where opportunities are, identify bottlenecks (usually waiting for external resources like technical demo, contract review) and adjust activity allocation (for example, spend more time prospecting when top of the funnel is empty). Most salesforce automation tools provide a graphical sales funnel and use sales stage information to help predict the odds of closing an opportunity.  Request for proposal (RFP) After an organization has made the decision to outsource and has established a list of potential providers of the services requested, the next step is to narrow this master list of providers down to the short list by evaluating the vendor responses to certain documents. An RFP consists of a detailed list of what services or criteria a company requires from its supplier. Giga frequently recommends that client organizations use the RFP process to support the procurement of computer hardware, software and services. The main components include an introduction, a list of system requirements, evaluation criteria and a proposal.  Screen pops Screen pops are windows of information about a call or customer that are automatically ""popped"" onto an agent's screen to provide supplemental information about the current phone call. Computer telephony integration (CTI) is the technology that translates the telephone number or customer identifier to the computer in order to ""pop"" the right information.  Request for quotation (RFQ) After an organization has made the decision to outsource and has established a list of potential providers of the services requested, the next step is to narrow this master list of providers down to the short list by evaluating the vendor responses to certain documents. If price is the primary driver, then an RFQ can be sent out with or prior to the RFP. By using an RFQ at this stage, a company can further narrow the field of possible suppliers based on the price they offer for their service.  Service-level agreements (SLAs) Service-level agreements outline the specific scope of services, detail exactly how these services will be provided, outline the quality of the service and metrics that will be used to measure the effectiveness of these services and contain the consequences for nonattainment of the SLAs.  Sales forecasting Sales forecasting is a sales activity, supported by sales-force automation software, that allows sales reps to periodically report to management on the status and likelihood of closing sales opportunities. Forecasts are usually done in terms of the sales ""funnel"" (see below), often by applying a percent chance of closing to the expected revenue from the opportunity. Sales forecasting helps sales reps evaluate their sales efforts in terms of likely revenue attainment. However, it primarily helps sales management fine-tune sales performance, and so is often resented by sales representatives for its ""Big Brother"" effect.  Service request management (See case management) Service request management may also include field service requests, such as computer, home appliance or other local repair that requires scheduling, parts management and route optimization. It ensures that customer requests are registered and answered in a timely manner and also helps optimize service worker time.

Smart scripts are those that change based on how the customer has answered previous questions, allowing the agent to sound more interactive and respond to customer needs or concerns. Scripts help ensure quality customer interaction by offering scripted, approved customer conversations.  Top-level domains (TLDs) An Internet Protocol (IP) address suffix, including .com, .net, .org, .edu and seven new ""second-generation"" TLDs: .aero (aviation industry), .biz (e-commerce companies), .coop (nonprofit cooperatives), .info (general purpose, like .com or .net), .museum (museums), .name (personal Web sites), .pro (accountants, doctors, lawyers). If the introduction of secondgeneration TLDs is successful, look for future generations of TLDs on a periodic basis, as often as once a year.  Stock-keeping unit (SKU) A code designated to an individual piece of merchandise to aid in tracking and acquiring descriptions and pricing information.  Trading partner management (TPM) Storage service provider (SSP) Also called managed storage providers (MSPs), the pure vision of an SSP is to provide ""storage as a utility,"" allowing companies to selectively outsource their storage and data management. The opportunity for the SSP market is a result of the collision of explosive data growth with the lack of maturity of distributed storage hardware and management software. A category of software tools that provide administrative capability to manage various aspects of multiple trading partners, such as security, routing, business relationships, etc.  Value-added networks (VANs) Managed network services provided over proprietary communication links (leased-line and dialup). VANs have traditionally provided the communications backbone for electronic data interchange (EDI) systems since the early 1980s. VANs provide additional security, mailbox store and forward capability, nonrepudiation, 24x7 help desk support and management reporting capability.  Supply chain management (SCM) The process of managing logistical processes throughout the supply chain to ensure the maximum efficiency and optimum levels of inventory.  Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) Supply chain planning (SCP) Traditional SCP solutions are designed to predict and optimize the flow of materials across the supply chain. Business functions include demand planning, inventory and distribution planning, manufacturing planning and scheduling, and transport optimization. Traditional solutions consist of highly scalable enterprise applications, which are able to tie together remote portions of the business plants, distribution centers and business centers on a global basis and support business processes that enable optimal decision-making. Vendor-managed inventory systems are a proven technique for improving the efficiency of supply chain operations. They are made possible by the implementation of an electronic means of exchanging inventory information between the buyers and sellers of products. These electronic links eliminate many of the built-in delays associated with traditional ordering systems and enable the establishment of collaborative inventory management systems.  Web-based enterprise management (WBEM) WBEM is an ambitious effort to deploy the Web as a means of overlaying and integrating the disparate systems and network management tools, platforms, repositories and protocols scattered throughout Global 2000 enterprises. At the heart of WBEM are two components: common information model (CIM), now being developed under the auspices of the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF), and the Hypermedia Management Protocol (HMMP), the detailed specification of which remains in the hands of the Microsoftled WBEM consortium.  Telemarketing While industry terms differ, telemarketing typically refers to outbound agents who call customers and prospects with targeted offers. It often works in combination with an automatic call distributor (ACD) that automatically calls down a phone list and routes live calls to agents. Telemarketing can also be called telesales in some industries (although telesales usually takes both inbound and outbound calls). There is very little benefit to the customer (why do telemarketers always call during dinner?), but it is heavily used in business-to-consumer (B2C) industries, such as credit card or mortgage, to generate leads and/or sales. Regional regulatory differences make this much less prevalent in Europe.  Web forms Third-party hosted solutions ticipate in e-commerce. The browser to be able to access EDI documents.

Web hosting This business comes in several flavors, with the outsourcer providing varying degrees of hardware and support. For example, a business can own the software license, the servers and the people who maintain it, and use the outsourcer to house hardware in its facility. This is known as collocation -- the business shares data center space with others in the same facility. Web hosting can also be classified as dedicated, shared and custom. The only difference is the extent of ownership of components and the degree of management responsibility between the outsourcer and the business, ranging from companies that support everything themselves and want to effectively rent ""rack space"" to companies that want the outsourcer to manage everything except the application software package itself.  Web server A computer that provides World Wide Web services on the Internet. If the Web server is for internal use, it is known as an intranet server.  Wired for Management Initiative (WFM) Developed by Intel, WFM is a set of three major components, including hardware and software instrumentation, workgroup management and enterprise management. The actual technologies include the desktop management interface (DMI) and Intel LANDesk.  Workflow The instantiations of customer interactions are represented by a variety of objects within the customer relationship management (CRM) applications, such as support incidents, customer orders, or sales opportunities. Workflow describes the ownership paradigm of these objects as they transition from ""open"" states to ""closed"" states. Workflow is integrated with the rules engine of the applications, so service-level agreements and other commitments are met, with exceptions being reported to a supervisor.  XML (Extensible Markup Language) A document format for the Web that is more flexible than HTML. While HTML uses only predefined tags to describe elements within the page, XML allows tags to be defined by the developer of the page.  www.gigaweb.com   2001 Giga Information Group Inc.

GX033-20-9481381	"INCAPACITATING SPRINGS PUBLIC LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY PLAN                                                        2000-2002   FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE DISCOUNTS AND LSTA GRANT APPLICATIONS   1.  MISSION: SERVICE VISION   The Incapacitating Springs Public Library technology plan supports the library's Long Range Plan, 2000-2002, goal of ""Electronic democracy for all people to meet their need to obtain and evaluate information in the technological world of today and the future."" The Long Range Plan and the accompanying Technology Plan were devised to support the State Library of Florida's overall goal of ""Access for All,"" and specifically that ""All the people of Florida have equitable access to the world of information through libraries.""   2.  SERVICES, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES   To achieve this vision the library's Three Year Long Range Plan, 2000-2002, has three goals that relate to technology.   a) ""Maximum access for all the community to needed information related to business and finance, government, consumer or general subjects in a satisfactory and timely manner.""   b) ""Adequate current materials both print and non-print that respond to the need for information, inspiration, education and recreation for all ages and backgrounds.""   c) Electronic democracy for all people to meet their need to obtain and evaluate information in the technological world of today and the future."" To satisfy these goals the library expends 20% of its materials budget on electronic resources. The library has mounted a home page that provides easier access to information on the Internet, as well as information on library services and programs.   The library utilizes information on the Internet whenever practicable for quickest and most economical response. Also, the library provides databases on-line whenever practicable for integrated and expeditious access through group licensing.   3.  STAFF AND PATRON TRAINING   The library utilizes electronic training opportunities either locally, regionally or those made possible through the State Library. To date all staff have had training on Windows 95, Netscape and Internet searching. Half of the staff have had Troubleshooting PCs. Other staff have had html and more advanced or subject specialized Internet searching sessions.   The library conducts two weekly classes for adults and two for youth on computer training. One adult weekly class is very basic, covering computer literacy, use of the mouse and an overview of computer functions, including the Internet. The other class emphasizes the library catalog, the CD-ROM resources and Internet searching. Adult classes are given utilizing the computer projector in the meeting room and, subsequently, hands on practice in the library public area. Library prepared visual handouts are used.   Six week basic computer literacy classes are conducted by the library using the local high school computer lab and volunteer instructors. To date over 500 adults have benefited from these courses.   4.  EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES   The library currently provides on-line patron access to its holdings and those of eight other libraries in a shared database, ""Fuddline."" The library utilizes Ameritech's Dynix automated system which provides a link to the holdings of the other five libraries in the Lou Pinella Memorial Public Library Cooperative, as well as to those in the Forgotten Hills Library System, the Tabasco Sauce County Library System and the Mugwump Community College and State University System.   The library provides access to electronic based information resources through a wide area network and a local area network. The wide area frame relay network provides access to Dynix and the Fuddline shared database. It also provides Internet access. The telecommunications line is a fractional T-1 (384Kpbs).   The local area network is Microsoft Windows NT and the server provides access to the 21 disc CD-ROM tower server. Also loaded on the system is First Search, Britannica Encyclopedia, Information Access' Infotrak, UMI's Newspaper database and the World Wide Web.   Currently, the library has 33 personal computers, all but three are networked.   Two of these are available for public use for word processing with Microsoft Office. One has ten years of indexing and full text to the local daily newspaper, the Angstville Times. There are 11 dumb terminals connected to the Dynix system. These provide text based access to the interconnected library catalogs, as well as to the periodical indexing with abstracts and full text mounted on Dynix.   Three networked personal computers are allocated to reference service. Thirteen PC's are available for adult use of the catalogs, CD-ROMs and the Internet. Seven networked PCs are provided for children's use. Adult patrons use the public access computers on a ""first come, first serve"" basis. Numbers are given out and time noted. If other patrons are waiting the time allowed for use is one half hour for the eight terminals assigned to reference use. Five other computers may be used on the same basis for one hour periods. Children's computer use is somewhat more flexible and is supervised and coached carefully. The Computer and Internet Usage Policy is prominently displayed.   Two computers are used for cataloging, acquisitions and interlibrary loan. The remaining four PC's are used by librarians for administrative purposes. For the public, one printer is available for every two workstations. All other computers have a printer attached. Dial-up access is provided through a local telephone number.   The library accesses the City's IBM AS400 through one personal computer and three terminals directly connected through a dedicated line to City Hall. Seven telephone lines, three modem lines and one fax line are installed. The 20,00 square foot facility built in 1997 is category five wired and is expandable.   5.  PLANNED TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADES, SERVICES AND TIME LINE     YEAR 1: 2000 Objectives   a) The library will increase the number of public access computers from I workstation per 1,050 residents to I workstation per 875 residents.

GX242-69-3458472	"The State Library of Ohio  Public Terminals Acceptable Use Policy   Revisions approved by the Library Board on July 31, 2003    INTRODUCTION    Integral to the Mission of the State Library of Ohio is the provision of  information to meet the needs of Ohio's state government and citizens.  The State Library endeavors to develop collections, resources, and services to fulfill this mission.     As a state agency, the State Library of Ohio has a management responsibility as cited in Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) Directive 01-25 to establish an appropriate policy to administer use of  the Internet and online services supported by the agency.  It is within this context that the State Library of Ohio offers access to the Internet and other on-line services.      FILTERS    The State Library of Ohio uses a filter software application to screen all public computers having Internet access.  Filters are not  foolproof :  sometimes filtered sites may slip through;  other times filters may block unintended sites.  In the latter situation, the filters  can be overridden by library staff to permit access for government documents and other types of research.  The State Library of Ohio expressly abrogates responsibility for the effectiveness of its filtering software application.       GUIDELINES FOR USE      State Library public terminals will be used for educational, informational, and recreational  purposes only;  use for unauthorized, illegal or unethical purposes is prohibited.      Access to or display of obscene language and sexually explicit graphics as defined in section 2901.01 and 2907.31 of the Ohio Revised Code is not permitted.    U.S. copyright law (Title 17, U.S. Code) prohibits the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted materials, except as permitted by the principles of ""fair use.""  Users may not copy or distribute electronic materials without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.      Software or other computer programs may NOT be downloaded from the Internet; only citations and information resources may be downloaded to diskette on State Library public terminals.      Users are prohibited from misrepresenting themselves as another user; attempting to modify or gain access to files, passwords, or data belonging to others; seeking unauthorized access to any computer system, or damaging or altering software components of any network or database.    Minor children  must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian when accessing the Internet from State Library public terminals.  Age restrictions do not apply for patrons doing government documents research.    The State Library is not responsible for Internet connections that are temporarily unavailable due to technical difficulties.    Users may not modify or change State Library terminal settings, or reboot public terminals.      Users playing games may be asked to give up their terminal to someone needing to do research when the library is busy.     Failure to abide by these policies may result in suspension of State Library services and privileges.          SLO Info  |   Home        page url - http://winslo.state.oh.us/usepol.html  Date: 08/03"

Buckley, Jr.   Superintendent of Documents    Depository Library Council Meeting  Mobile, AL  April 22, 2002      Introduction    Good morning, and welcome.  I am happy to be here in Mobile today, and I am very pleased to see all of you here too.  I would like to begin my remarks in a rather unusual way.  Id like to pay a tribute to one of us, a former documents librarian and, Id say, citizen activist, Lois Mills.  She was also a former member of this Council and a faithful attendee of these meetings both while she was working and after she retired.  She passed away in December 2000.    I was privileged to attend a small memorial service for Lois last week as she was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery.  As the government documents librarian at Western Illinois University, she was renowned for the service she delivered to students, faculty, and the public.  But her zeal for public causes, including the right for access to government information, led her to be active in state and local politics and in organizations ranging from the American Library Association, ACLU, and the Freedom to Read Foundation to educational, ecological, and animal rights organizations.         She was a model, not of a modern sergeant-major as Gilbert and Sullivan used the phrase, but of a real-life first-class sergeant in World War II who continued a life of public service as a teacher, school librarian, and university librarian.  She was a recipient of the ALA/CIS Documents to the People Award and the GODORT James Bennett Childs Award, for a lifetime of contributions to government documents librarianship.  She was a model for all of us to emulate as we work towards improving the Federal Depository Library Program and our delivery of access to government information to the public.    Now Id like to talk about some of the accomplishments of the Federal Depository Library Program and some of the issues facing us.  Federal depository libraries serve an estimated 9.5 million people each year, not counting those who use  GPO Access  outside the libraries.  In FY 2001, GPO distributed 5.9 million copies of approximately 14,700 tangible products in print, microform, and CD-ROM formats to depository libraries.    Virtually every depository library also has access to the vast range of information made available online via  GPO Access .  In FY 2001, over 15,200 online titles and over 7,600 links to agency titles were added to  GPO Access , for a total of well over 22,000 new online titles that year alone.  There were 355 million document retrievals from  GPO Access  in FY 2001.  All of this equates to a greatly expanded delivery of government information to users.    Information Security Concerns     The goal for the FDLP for many years has been to be as inclusive as possible while operating within our defined scope and principles, to identify public interest materials produced through GPO or agency publishing channels, to provide bibliographic control for the materials, and to provide the publications to depository libraries for public access.  Following the events of September 11, our mission has not changed, but agency sensitivity to what should be distributed to the public is heightening.    The struggle to balance such liberties as freedom of speech and the right to know with concerns for public safety and national security is an old one.  I would like to share a quotation with you from the eighteenth-century author and lexicographer, Samuel Johnson: ""Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.""    Without free access to knowledge, the integrity of our nation and its citizens would be ""weak and useless"" indeed.  However, recent events have demonstrated just how ""dangerous and dreadful"" that same knowledge can be when it is not coupled with integrity.  We must not make our citizens and fellow agencies weak through lack of knowledge.  But we must not put that knowledge into the hands of those who lack integrity, because they are indeed ""dangerous and dreadful"" if they use sensitive public information for destructive purposes.    The depository program and the sales program have been at the center of some concern about access to unclassified materials which have been distributed but which may be used improperly.  Since last September, agencies on their own initiative have been reviewing their titles to determine which are ""sensitive,"" and which non-classified information the agency had published should be withdrawn in the interest of national security.  When and if agencies decide specific titles are ""for official use only,"" or ""for administrative use only,"" then that title no longer meets the criteria outlined in Section 1902 of Title 44, and therefore it is no longer in the scope of the program.    To establish general guidelines and criteria for this process, on March 19 of this year, the White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies calling for ""action to safeguard information regarding weapons of mass destruction and other sensitive documents related to homeland security.""    He transmitted guidance from the NARA Information Security Oversight Office and the Justice Departments Office of Information and Privacy for ""reviewing Government information in your department or agency regarding weapons of mass destruction, as well as other information that could be misused to harm the security of our Nation and the safety of our people.""    He asked all departments and agencies to review their record management procedures and, when appropriate, their holdings of documents to ensure that they are acting in accordance with the guidance.  In addition to discussing the extension of classification and reclassification of information ""that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass destruction,"" the guidance establishes a new category of ""Sensitive but Unclassified Information.""    This category is addressing ""sensitive information related to Americas homeland security that might not meet one or more of the standards for classification""  The guidance suggests, ""the need to protect such sensitive information from inappropriate disclosure should be carefully considered, on a case-by-case basis, together with the benefits that result from the open and efficient exchange of scientific, technical, and like information.""    But the guidance goes on to say, ""All departments and agencies should ensure that in taking necessary and appropriate actions to safeguard sensitive but unclassified information related to Americas homeland security, they process any Freedom of Information request for records containing such information in accordance with the Attorney Generals FOIA Memorandum of October 12, 2001, by giving full and careful consideration to all applicable FOIA exemptions.""    Some agencies are in the process of adopting specific procedures to determine what publications may be released to the public.  Well hear about several of their efforts during this conference.    As you know, since the September 11 attacks, the U.S. Geological Survey CD-ROM entitled  Source Area Characteristics of Large Public Surface-Water Supplies in the Conterminous United States: An Information Resource for Source-Water Assessment, 1999  is the only tangible publication that we have requested be withdrawn from depository libraries.    Concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity of some technical report titles in depository libraries.  Some people have suggested that users of certain collections should be screened.  There is no statutory basis, nor is it consistent with the public purpose of the FDLP, to impose access controls or restrictions on particular public documents.    Unless the publishing agencies ask that their titles be withdrawn from depository collections, depository libraries are required to provide full public access to all the depository material.  There are no varying levels of access to Government information included in the Federal Depository Library Program; either it is a freely accessible public document, or it is not part of the program.    Security concerns also have great implications in the online environment.  Government information on the web in electronic format is widely accessible, heretofore considered a good thing, but now it is being reconsidered.    In response to agency publishing on the web, the FDLP is identifying, pointing to, acquiring, creating metadata for, and in many cases archiving electronic publications from the agencies to provide ongoing free public access to these resources.  This move towards a more electronic FDLP, coupled with heightened security awareness, has brought out concerns specific to titles distributed electronically.  We are working to provide permanent preservation of and access to the Government information in our electronic collection.    In the print world, it is possible to assume that the document found in a depository library is as it was published, and that it is an official publication of the source agency.  With our electronic collection, we must go to great lengths to ensure that all of our electronic titles are, and remain, the official content issued by the publishing agency.    The events of September 11 clearly demonstrate the strong need for redundancy of data storage at remote sites.  We are in the process of establishing a geographically separate backup facility and mirror site for  GPO Access .  T.C. Evans will say more about this later.    But the FDLP/EC includes, in addition to the extensive data on GPO servers, pointers to thousands of titles on agency websites.  We have addressed the issue of instability of agency site location by our use of Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs), and by capturing a copy of the online publication at the time of cataloging in a digital archive.  If the link to the title is broken, we try to find the current one and redirect the PURL there, or redirect to an archived version if the title is no longer available at the agency site.    Since September 11, we have added one step to this process: before redirecting to our archived version, we must contact the originating agency to determine why the site is no longer available.  If the site was removed because the agency deemed it to be sensitive material, then it has moved out of the scope of the program.  If the site was removed for other reasons, such as lack of server space, then it remains part of the program and the PURL redirects to our archived version.    Less than 50 agency titles we cataloged and linked to as part of the FDLP/EC have been withdrawn by their originating agencies for a security review.  However, we are aware that many more titles have been withdrawn on agency websites, including on some of the partnership sites we link to on GPO Access, such as the DOE/OSTI Information Bridge.    State Planning     Starting over 20 years ago, GPO encouraged depository libraries and state library agencies to work together to develop state plans for the delivery of depository services within their states or service areas.  Since then, much has changed in the FDLP and in the way libraries receive and deliver information in general.    Now more than ever, it is essential that depository libraries work together to redefine program relationships, and to develop a support network that places initial reliance on state and regional resources.  The transition to the E-FDLP has caused a major re-examination of the roles and responsibilities of GPO, and the regional and selective depositories.  Users expectation of instant gratification and immediate access to all information has put stresses upon traditional library services as well as government information programs in depository libraries.    A state plan is not a requirement of the program, but I believe that when libraries develop state plans, they are better prepared to provide information services to patrons, and the cooperative system it establishes among libraries implements, in a practical sense, the philosophy of the FDLP.  State planning is one way that libraries can come together, in the spirit of resource sharing, to come up with ways to help each other, improve service delivery to their users, and stretch limited resources.    Last week I attended a meeting of the depository librarians in Georgia as they reviewed a final draft of a new state plan among themselves and with library directors and the state librarian.  The synergy from the dialog there is going to lead to increased outreach activities in a joint effort between depository libraries and the State Library.    Efforts To Publicize and Promote the FDLP     In todays dynamic environment of information access, it is crucial to the future of the FDLP that both the library community and the public at large understand and appreciate its value as an information resource and point of service for everyone.    In response to the need for higher visibility for the program, and in response to a recommendation from the Council, we have drafted a new promotion plan for the FDLP.  The goal of this plan is to increase public awareness of the unique contributions and benefits of Federal depository libraries, especially in this time of increased availability of Government information online.  Target audiences for this plan include the general public, business, government, and the library community.    The plan has a proposed campaign theme: "" U.S. Government Information  Make the Connection at a Federal Depository Library .""  The focus will be on free access to the public, the quantity and variety of Government information available in print and electronic formats in depository libraries, and the services provided by depository librarians in finding this information.  Print and broadcast public service announcements, news releases and feature articles, and a variety of promotional materials will be used to publicize the campaign.  Depository librarians, GPO bookstores and congressional offices will also use the promotional materials.  We look forward to your comments regarding this new promotion plan.     Sales Program Update    For those who want to purchase Government publications, many of the titles that we distribute to depository libraries are also available through GPOs Sales Program.  Approximately 9,500 titles are available for sale at any given time, including books, CD-ROMs, and other electronic formats.    Publications are sold principally by mail, telephone, fax, and through our bookstores located in the Washington, DC area and around the country.  Publications are also sold through the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, CO.  More than 1,800 sales orders are processed every day.  Also, more and more orders are being placed through GPO's secure Online Bookstore site at: <http://bookstore.gpo.gov>.  The Online Bookstores   Sales Product Catalog is searchable by publication title, subject, and keywords.  All titles available for sale can be ordered through the Online Bookstore.     Unfortunately, as a result of the publics increased ability to access Government publications free of charge over the Internet, as well as a reduction in the number of publications produced to sell, the Sales Program has been losing money for several years.  Efforts to reduce costs, hold vacancies due to attrition, and raise prices have not been sufficient to keep pace with declining revenues.  Many of you are aware that we have closed GPO Bookstores in six locations, and we are now considering closing as many more.    The decision to close locations is based on program performance.  Despite increased marketing attempts, these locations have continued to have low sales volumes and do not generate sufficient revenue to recover even direct expenses.  Residents of the areas served by these bookstores will not be deprived of access to U.S. Government publications.    Press releases announcing the closings encourage the use of local Federal depository libraries, the Online Bookstore, and telephone ordering via our toll free number.    Conclusion     In the evolutionary development of the FDLP and our distribution programs, we have seen many milestones and many changes, some more welcome than others.  However, amid all this change, some things are not changing.  The FDLP,  GPO Access , and our sales program, as well as you and your libraries, remain committed to provide public access to official, public Government information.    I would like to encourage all of you to attend the sessions during the conference for more detailed information about the topics that I have touched on this morning.  I want to thank all of you for being here today; I look forward to talking to many of you individually.  Enjoy the meeting!            [  Back to the Table of Contents  ]                  This is What the Future Looks Like  Remarks by Gil Baldwin   Director, Library Programs Service     Depository Library Council Meeting Mobile, AL  April 22, 2002     Good morning!  Its a pleasure to see you here today, and especially so many new faces in a Council meeting.  Your presence demonstrates the reason we hold these meetings around the country--so depository librarians can come who might be unable to attend a distant meeting.    Many of you know I like to have a theme for my presentation; I feel it establishes a foundation for what you will hear.  Today my topic is ""This what the future looks like,"" but since I was an undergraduate history major, we are going to start with a bit of program history.     Seven years ago (not fourscore and seven, just plain old seven), GPO was required by the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to perform a study.  The outcome of that broadly participatory effort was our report to the Congress, the ""Study To Identify Measures Necessary For A Successful Transition To A More Electronic Federal Depository Library Program.""    Embedded in this tome was a timetable for the transition.  The input we had received from publishing agencies and depository libraries indicated a five to seven year transition would be realistic since it would allow GPO to migrate to the use of electronic information at the same pace as publishing agencies that produce it.  More importantly, the five to seven year plan gave depository libraries and the public a reasonable time to adapt.  Consequently, the report proposed, and Congress accepted, a transition period extending through FY 2001.    By that reckoning we must be done now, so just as Washington Redskins Hall of Fame football coach George Allen once said, ""the future is now.""  So the FDLP of the future looks like this  a work in progress and all about access.    Its about access to online information, provided through resource discovery, bibliographic control, and cataloging.  Its about permanent public access provided through an interlocking set of procedures and partnerships.  Its about access to libraries and their public computer workstations.  And most recently its been about the tension between unfettered access to information and the need to secure some information that could be disastrous in the wrong hands.    But sometimes its not all about us.  The FDLP is also affected by the larger environment.  In recent months the most obvious example is the withdrawal of some previously public information in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  And while the information security issue has received a great deal of publicity, it is by no means the only external factor operating on the program.  In recent months we have heard that the funding pinch at the state level is hurting libraries, and this has become a contributing factor to libraries leaving the program.    The FDLP is also a work in progress.  We all know the transition to a more electronic program isnt finished, and that there is still more work to be done to improve our cataloging efforts, to protect free public access, and to enhance the infrastructure that provides reliable and secure permanent access.       Biennial Survey Highlights     The 2001 Biennial Survey of Depository Libraries was conducted beginning last November.  As required by law, the Biennial Survey gathers data every 2 years to report on conditions in the depository libraries.  Your responses supplement the more in-depth site visits and self-studies that are performed every 6 or 7 years.    As we have done for several years, the complete Biennial Survey data set will be posted on the Federal Bulletin Board.  But in the meantime, I wanted to mention some Survey highlights from the 1294 responses tallied so far.  By the way, thats a pretty good response rate, much better than prior years.    We always ask ""Do you want to remain in the Federal Depository Library Program?""  This time, 1,286 said ""yes"" and only 6 said ""no.""  We hope this is an accurate reflection of intent to stay in the Program, because as you may know, a very significant number of libraries have already given up depository status, and we hate to lose any more.  Unfortunately, four of the six have already advised us that they are dropping depository status, and recently two more libraries relinquished status out of the blue.    Many of our questions relate to issues about access.  For example, 903 libraries have a written access policy for the depository collection.  Developing such policies helps articulate the value of the depository library collection to your community, and while a 70% positive response is pretty good, it could be better.  We encourage you to develop a written access policy if you do not have one.    Furthermore, access policies need to reflect the electronic environment.  Just under half (642 of 1,294)) of the respondents report having a written policy regarding public services for Government information in electronic formats.  There is no question that developing such policies is hard work, and we commend those libraries that have a policy for electronic FDLP services in place.    This time we asked specifically if the library provides access to the World Wide Web, and 1,282 said they did.  The ubiquitous level of service is very encouraging, and demonstrates the overall ability of depository libraries to function in the electronic arena.  Overall, depository libraries are playing a role in bridging the digital divide.  As for the 12 libraries that do not offer the public access to the Internet, you are missing out on the bulk of what is in todays FDLP.    We also asked if your library uses filtering or blocking software on the public access workstations, and 181 replied yes.  We only hope that, consistent with the FDLP Internet Use Policy Guidelines < www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/mgt/iupolicy.html >  policy, you can disable the filtering if a user searching FDLP information so requests.    Integrated Library System     In the fiscal year 2002 appropriation, GPO received general approval from Congress for systems modernization.  LPS intends to acquire a commercial off-the-shelf Integrated Library System (ILS) within the next year.  We want to bring our own operation up to the level of performance that nearly all of you now enjoy.  All but 10 depositories use some type of ILS, with the most frequently mentioned being Innovative Interfaces Millennium (360), Endeavors Voyager (167), Sirsi (127), and the ever-popular ""other"" (140).    LPS operations will change to make use of the capabilities of a new system.  In the environment of managing the FDLP Electronic Collection, our goal is make our services and operations as standard brands library-like as possible.  It is especially likely that the way in which we distribute the dwindling number of physical products in the program will have to change.  We are still maintaining the distribution infrastructure from the days when we shipped six times as many physical products.    LPS expects to use the ILS to support cataloging, classification, acquisitions, serial check-in, library directory maintenance, and to provide distribution information to the distribution system.  We anticipate that public access to the Federal Government will be improved through use of a standard Web interface catalog.  In addition, much of the product status information you now ask us for should be accessible to you directly through the system.       To date, a working group of LPS staff has:       Looked at current systems in use by LPS and their functions.        Developed a statement of work to obtain the services of a library automation consultant.  The consultant will assist us with defining our user requirements and with developing the criteria for selecting between competing systems.        Begun to define system requirements.        Begun to define data migration strategies.        Begun investigating existing ILS offerings.        Begun investigating training opportunities to prepare for an ILS.        Queried other libraries that have obtained and implemented an ILS.        Received input from the depository library community regarding interface requirements and service needs.        Begun to work with Materials Management Service, Network Systems, the Office of Information Resources Management, and other GPO personnel.        Developed material to request project approval from the Joint Committee on Printing.  And Im happy to say that on Friday [April 19, 2002] that approval was granted.     LPS Staffing Changes     Last fall I briefed Council on the unprecedented personnel turnover in LPS, both among the managers and operational staff.  We have been working intensively to fill these vacancies and I am now able to report some progress.    James Mauldin is now the Chief of the Depository Distribution Division, and Im very glad to have him there.  James is also very savvy technically, and he is still acting as our network administrator.  James is backed up by LPS veterans Cornelius Greene, Joe Powell, and James Brevard, all of whom have begun new positions this year.       Within a one-year span, LPS has lost four people to the Library of Congress, two to the Defense Technical Information Center, and one each to the Internal Revenue Service and the National Library of Education.  These moves dont count retirements and other causes.  The impact of this out-migration has been particularly marked among the library inspectors, Cataloging Branch staff, and in the Depository Distribution Division.    Weve recently filled our two vacant Cataloging Section Chief positions, by selecting Michael Levinson and Jennifer Davis.  Both Mike and Jennifer have previous experience as serials catalogers in LPS, and are very savvy about processing electronic products.    Since the last Council meeting we have brought one cataloger on board, and extended offers to two more.  At this moment, we have 14 catalogers on board, and we still have six cataloging positions yet to fill.  Weve also hired one library inspector, for a total of four, and three more program analysts.  Most of these are backfilling behind people who left, and LPS staffing remains significantly below our budgeted level.  We are also in the process of recruiting for a new librarian position that will augment Betty Jones operation in the Depository Administration Branch.  As always, you can keep track of LPS staff moves by using the ""Contacts"" page on the FDLP Desktop < www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/tools/contacts.html >.    Electronic Documents Working Group     We have been working successfully with the ""Electronic Documents Working Group.""  Volunteer members of the depository library and law library communities are assisting GPO in its efforts to bring fugitive online documents into the FDLP Electronic Collection (FDLP/EC).  Fugitives are those documents of public interest or educational value, and not classified for reasons of national security, which have not been acquired for distribution to Federal depository libraries or made accessible through the Catalog of U.S Government Publications (CGP).    There are two volunteer groups, one comprised primarily of American Library Association Government Documents Round Table people, and one of members of the American Association of Law Librarians.  Three of their main functions are to:       Identify electronic titles that are not yet in the program, and evaluate them for inclusion in the FDLP/EC.        Identify online titles currently in the program in tangible format for possible migration to ""e-only"".        Identify titles/products that are currently in the program that have become fugitive, and determine their status and availability.     To support this activity we first established the Working Group site on the FDLP Desktop < http://ww1.access.gpo.gov/gpoaccess/fdlp/tools/ewgroup/ewg_memb.html >, including lists of the participants, what agencies they are each looking at, project resources, and more.  We have asked contributors to supply some basic bibliographic elements, suggest a SuDocs class stem, and so on.  So theres more involved in this project that just the resource discovery phase.  To support that, the various policies and processing guidelines that we use in LPS are available on the FDLP Desktop.  So far we have received over 350 submissions.  A few of these concern URLs that might be added to existing records, but most are identifying electronic fugitive documents.    Recently, LPS established a new email address, <lostdocs@gpo.gov>, for reporting fugitive documents.  Previously the Electronic Documents Working Group and other members of the depository community sent all such notices to askLPS.  The increasing volume of submissions to that location prompted the decision to separate the fugitive documents reports.  This address, or its corresponding Web page < www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/tools/lostdocs.html >,  should be used to notify LPS of any fugitive documents, regardless of format.   New Partnerships     Partnerships remain an important component of carrying out our commitment to permanent public access.  Were pleased that we have nearly wrapped up two more partnerships, both of which have been under discussion for some time.    The first, between GPO and the libraries of Indiana University, Bloomington, establishes permanent public access provisions for a collection of electronic publications originally distributed to depository libraries on floppy disk.  IU, as part of a consortium effort within the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), has mounted the content on servers for Web access.  Many of the floppy disks were 5.25"", and the drives are increasingly rare.  The project relieves individual depository libraries of the burden of making older floppy disk media and outdated operating systems continuously available, as well as assuring that the information will be preserved in a stable environment.    The second, between GPO, the University Library of Case Western Reserve University, and the Census Bureau, establishes a Web site specifically for depository library access to Census 2000 data issued by the Census Bureau in comma- delimited ASCII format.  Similar files were disseminated on CD-ROM for the past two censuses, and were made available over the Internet by FTP for the first time for Census 2000.  To answer concerns within the FDLP community regarding download times and permanent public access, Case Western Reserve University will operate an FTP site for the files that will be specifically designated for FDLP users, and will assure that permanent public access provisions are in effect for these files.    These projects fill in more squares in the permanent public access matrix, and we thank Lou Malcomb of IU-Bloomington, and Tim Robson of Case Western, for being champions of these partnerships in their institutions.    Publicity and Promotion     Years ago the FDLP was sometimes referred to as the best-kept secret in Washington.  Were sure not a secret anymore!  Recently the program has gotten more publicity and attention than any of us could have imagined.  Its true that maybe it hasnt been all we could have wished for, since weve gotten more attention over one withdrawn CD-ROM than we ever did over hundreds of thousands of publications distributed and cataloged, or users served.    What we would like to do, however, is to improve the positive awareness of the FDLP through a combination of national and local publicity efforts.  And there is definitely room for improvement.  In the Biennial Survey you told us that only 202 of you engage in active, on-going promotion to the general public.  The overwhelming majority admit to either infrequent promotion or no promotion to the general public.  We want to help you promote the value of depository libraries more effectively.    In early November, 2001, a GPO working group was convened to develop a marketing strategy to increase awareness of the FDLP among various constituencies.  Led by the Chief of the Promotion and Advertising Branch, with representation from the Library Programs Service (LPS) and the Office of Electronic Information Dissemination Services (EIDS), the Group has drafted a marketing plan around the theme ""U.S. Government Information: Make the Connection at Federal Depository Libraries.""  Examples of the graphic design associated with this campaign are here.  We are also working within GPO to make sure that you can request promotional information easily, and that fulfillment is quick.    Once again, on behalf of the entire LPS staff, its a pleasure to be here and talk with you.  Please give us your feedback, and ask any questions that are on your minds.            [  Back to the Table of Contents  ]                  Current and Future State of GPO Access By T.C. Evans  Director, Office of Electronic Information Dissemination Services     Depository Library Council Meeting  Mobile, AL  April 22, 2002     Introduction     I appreciate the opportunity to update the Depository Library Council and the library community on the current and future state of GPO Access.  Hopefully, you have a copy of our printed GPO Access update [see page 18].  It contains a variety of statistical information on GPO Access, as well as what is new and on the horizon.    The vast amount of information available on GPO Access continues to grow, and more users are finding their way to our applications.  Unfortunately, there was a lengthy period where system performance problems were severely limiting the amount of usage possible and frustrating large numbers of users.  Time-out and other types of errors were far too common, particularly during the busiest hours of the workday, and even successful transactions took far too long.  While I deeply regret this period of poor service to GPO Access users, particularly those who have come to rely on our Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations applications, I am pleased to report that diligent work by our Production department has resulted in making tremendous progress towards overcoming many of these problems.  As a result, system performance has improved dramatically in recent weeks.    Through a performance measurement service contract with Keynote Systems, Inc., we track performance from the user perspective around the clock.  We accomplish this by monitoring actual use of the Code of Federal Regulations application by agents located in 10 major cities in the United States.    The agents load the main CFR application page, perform a search for ""hazardous wastes,"" and retrieve a Title 40 document from the results list.  The computer agents are set up to act as users with common technology performing through connections commonly available through a variety of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), or parts of the Internet backbone.  Each agent makes multiple attempts each hour and both the time required for the agent to execute each part of the transaction and any errors encountered are recorded and the data is made available to us for analysis in a variety of ways.    The measurements helped to pinpoint problems being reported by users.  Specifically, we found that errors frequently occurred in the search and retrieval portions of the transaction and that most of these errors involved time-outs, particularly during prime usage hours.  It is important to note here that Keynote considers a lack of success after two minutes a failure at any of the three points of the measurement transaction.  In addition, we found that a significant number of users who succeeded in getting their search completed then encountered an error in attempting to download the target file.  Even successful transactions were taking an unacceptably long time to complete.  There were no particular patterns emerging regarding regions of the country or parts of the backbone, so we knew that the problem resided with us.    These findings gave us new tools to add to the feedback we had been getting from disgruntled users and both were shared with our Production department who went to work to use what we had learned to improve performance.  I am pleased to say that they have succeeded in eliminating almost all of the error problems and the results are showing dramatically reduced completion times for successful transactions.    On average, successful transactions are now taking less than 10 seconds from start to finish, with slightly longer times during our busiest hours.  This means that an agent can load the CFR application page, perform a search and receive the results of that search, initiate a download from the results and get the first byte of the target file on their machine very quickly.  Much faster than I could do myself, but that can be blamed on my typing skills, not GPO Access.    While these changes should greatly enhance the user experience on GPO Access, we will continue to work towards even more improvement in performance.  In addition to adjusting the operation of the current system and adding more resources to make the system deliver better response to users, there are efforts underway to identify a successor platform to the Wide-Area Information Server (WAIS) technology currently in use.  Funds have been included in the FY 2003 budget to acquire this, and it is hoped that a rapid deployment of the platform selected can be effected after it has been purchased.    These improvement efforts also include work towards establishing a geographically separate mirror site and backup facility for GPO Access in Pueblo, Colorado.  Based on a recently conducted onsite inspection of the facility, work will begin as soon as practicable.  This effort will be funded in part by the $4 million Congress provided to GPO in supplemental transfer authority for emergency preparedness (P.L. 107-117) following the events of September 11, 2001, in addition to other project funding from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Superintendent of Documents.    Beginning with the most frequently used GPO Access resources, GPO will steadily add to the resources and data at this facility until it is a complete mirror site for GPO Access.  This will include the portion of the FDLP Electronic Collection Archive maintained by GPO.    Search Engine Results     We have continued our work with maximizing our visibility in major Internet search engines.  In particular we have been testing paid keyword positioning for the U.S. Government Online Bookstore through the Overture service.  While we had some success, the results pointed out that more research was needed.  Therefore we contracted with Overture for a detailed analysis and recommendations for maximizing the visibility of the GPO Access main page, the Online Bookstore, and the Code of Federal Regulations main page.  The results of these efforts contained the following information:       A list of keywords to be bid on        Suggested bidding strategies        Total amount we could expect to spend each month, based on our budget and the position in Overture's search results (first or third, etc.)        Suggested language to appear with the links to GPO Access pages on Overture's search results     We are currently analyzing these proposals and hope to take action on them in the near future.    We have also continued to monitor the latest developments in the search engine industry, including sending staff to participate in the Search Engines Strategies Conference recently held in Boston, Massachusetts.  A good example is our examination of the offerings from the newly emergent Teoma engine.  Owned by Ask Jeeves, this search engine offers several new ways of searching for information.  Along with the regular results, it also provides suggestions for refining your search to obtain more specific results.    A list of suggested keywords refining your search will appear on the right side of the screen.  Clicking on one of these keywords will add them to the search terms you have entered and provide you with a new set of results.  The refinement process they offer and its ability to get at specific GPO Access resources looks promising.  In fact, we are adding it to the list of search engines that we regularly examine.   Joint effort with STAT-USA     My staff has been working hand-in-hand with STAT-USA to improve the availability and usability of their information products at depository libraries and as such will be including information on STAT-USAs State of the Nation (SOTN) and Global Business Opportunities (GLOBUS) & National Trade Data Bank (NTDB) products in  GPO Access  training classes.    EIDS Staff also worked with STAT-USA representatives on the development of a special insert for the GPO Access Training Manual and a new flyer to promote the partnership.  It is also expected that STAT-USA representatives will participate in  GPO Access  booth exhibits.    It is hoped that these cooperative efforts can promote and improve the use of these products in depositories as well as build a case for the possible addition of other products from STAT-USA in the future.    In addition to the previously mentioned products, two other services are currently available from STAT-USA.  These are USA Trade  Online  and EuroTrade  Online .    While there are barriers to offering free public access to these two products at Federal depository libraries, it is hoped that our working relationship will assist in overcoming them.  In the meantime, the information contained in USA Trade  Online  is available in the monthly U.S. Imports of Merchandise and U.S. Exports of Merchandise on CD-ROM.  Both are distributed through the Federal Depository Library Program.       Whats new on  GPO Access     There are a number of recent changes to  GPO Access  that should be mentioned.  The most notable are:       The Budget of the United States Government for FY 2003 is now available.  It was transmitted to Congress on February 2, 2002, and covers the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002.         The new edition of the Congressional Directory for the 107th Congress is also available.        The 2002 Economic Report of the President is now available on  GPO Access .

Whats on the Horizon for GPO Access     As always, work is under way to add more content to GPO Access and to refine access to the materials already provided.  Some key examples of current efforts are:       An interactive site guide is being developed to help users find their way to the resources of GPO Access.  Users will be able to follow a pathway of links in an exploration of the rich set of resources that GPO Access offers.  It will provide an augmented assistance tool that lets users learn more about what is available when the regular navigation paths fail to get them where they need to go.        Making use of what has been learned from our work with users in open forums, usability studies, and through regular feedback channels, work toward an enhanced look and feel for GPO Access has begun.  Please play a role in this process by attending the GPO Access Open Forum sessions this afternoon (Monday, April 22, 2002, at 2:00 pm and 3:30 pm) and reacting to some prototype pages created to show our current approach.        Future enhancements for the U.S. Government Online Bookstore include improved online ordering for foreign customers and providing third-party hand off of orders for those who are unable to directly purchase from the U.S. Government Online Bookstore.     User Survey     It is almost survey time again.  In the next few days the annual online GPO Access user survey will become available.  I hope you all will assist us by participating and alerting other users to this opportunity to play a role in the ongoing development of GPO Access.    Online Bookstore Enhancements     Several new features have been added to the U.S. Government Online Bookstore in order to enhance usability and expedite orders:       The various browse features on the Online Bookstore have been enhanced so that price and status information is updated daily.  In addition, customers may now use the search and browse features to add publications to their shopping cart for a fully integrated shopping experience.        While the Online Bookstore has safeguarded a customer's personal information through online encryption since 1999, the service was recently changed so users do not have to enter the secure environment until they have finished shopping and need to enter personal information when completing the order.     As you can tell, change is a constant with GPO Access.  As its offerings and popularity continue to grow, our efforts to provide the best possible service will make every effort to keep pace.  Once again I remind you that your feedback plays a vital role in this development process.  Participation in this afternoons open forum is an excellent opportunity to add your voice to the process, but a comment or suggestion sent to the GPO Access User Support Team serves well at any time.  Thank you and I look forward to talking with you during the conference.            [  Back to the Table of Contents  ]            GPO Access  Update  Office of Electronic Information Dissemination Services   Spring 2002 Depository Library Council Meeting   April 21-24, Mobile, AL     GPO Access  Performance Measurement and Improvement    It has recently become apparent that system performance problems have been severely limiting the amount of usage possible and frustrating large amounts of  GPO Access  users. Time-out and other types of errors were far too common, particularly during the busiest hours of the workday, and even successful transactions took far too long. Through a performance measurement service contract with Keynote Systems, Inc., we are tracking performance of the Code of Federal Regulations from the user perspective from ten major U.S. cities. The findings from this service and problem reports from users were shared with the GPO Production Department, who have begun work to eliminate these problems. They have succeeded in virtually eliminating the error problems, and results are showing that successful transactions during peak times are now taking on average less than 10 seconds from start to finish, down from over 42 seconds previously. We will continue to monitor performance with an eye towards improvement.       GPO Access  Statistical Measures       Since 1994,  GPO Access  retrievals have exceeded 1.2 billion. This is equivalent to over 29 billion typewritten pages.          GPO Access  has averaged close to 32 million document retrievals in the last six months, and reached an all-time high of almost 36.5 million document retrievals in October 2001.         GPO Access  contains over 133,000 electronic titles and points to over 89,000 others for a total of more than 222,000 titles.

GPO Access  Training Manual Updates     Updates to the  GPO Access  Training Manual were recently posted on the  GPO Access  help page. Approximately 33 pages were changed, including URL updates, new diagrams for tracking legislation, regulations, and Federal publications, and updated U.S. Government Online Bookstore information. In addition, a special insert has been added that discusses Federal depository library access to STAT-USA/Internet, which is provided through a partnership between the U.S. Government Printing Office and the Department of Commerce.

Upcoming Outreach     EIDS personnel will be attending and displaying the GPO booth at the following shows:         May 14-16     Info Today 2002     New York, NY       June 13-19     American Library Association Annual Conference     Atlanta, GA       June 30- July 2     National Education Association     Dallas, TX             http://www.gpo.gov/gpoaccess                 [  Back to the Table of Contents  ]              Responses To Recommendations  Depository Library Council  ·   Fall 2001        Scheduling    Council recommends that the Government Printing Office (GPO) implement the following schedule changes beginning with the Fall 2003 Council Meeting:       Retain the Sunday night through Wednesday afternoon meeting schedule, but move the Fall Orientation session for new Council members to the Thursday immediately following the meeting;     Consider concurrent or consecutively scheduled meetings with other library conferences (e.g. state associations, Public Library Association, Association of College and Research Libraries).     Rationale :  Moving the orientation to Thursday would provide more time for this valuable session, and would give new Council members background information from their first meeting to help them better understand GPO operations before their visit.  This schedule change would also not require non-Council members, many of whom pay some or all of their own expenses, to spend more money to stay additional time.    Having Council sessions in conjunction with other organizations meetings might increase the size of the audience, including librarians not primarily responsible for government information in their respective institutions.  Program opportunities might be enhanced by collaboration with these other organizations as well.    Response :   Scheduling for the Council and Fall Conference Meetings requires a great deal of coordination and planning, not only with Council members and GPO staff, but also in relation to other activities in the greater Washington metropolitan area.  The nations capital can be a difficult place in which to schedule meetings, and GPO tries to be as flexible as possible in order to obtain the best possible rates for the council/conference meeting rooms and hotel rooms for those registrants who require overnight accommodations.      The orientation session for new Council members is most effective at the beginning of the Council meeting, thus allowing new Council members to be better informed of the mission and operation of the Library Programs Service (LPS).  Moving the orientation session to Thursday extends the Council members stay by at least one more day, thus incurring additional costs for GPO and for Council members in the length of time they must spend away from their institution.  Therefore, we plan to retain the Sunday night through Wednesday afternoon meeting schedule, but move the orientation session for new Council members to Sunday afternoon.    We believe the problems arising from scheduling Council/Conference to run concurrently or consecutively with other organizations meetings would exceed the benefits, and could present unworkable scheduling difficulties for attendees, presenters, and LPS.  LPS reviews the evaluations after each Council/Conference meeting, and a frequent comment is that there are too many competing events and sessions.  Many attendees also mention that it is difficult for them to be away from their libraries for the full duration of the Conference.  GPO now contracts for hotel space and Conference facilities up to three years in advance, another factor that makes concurrent or consecutive scheduling with other events problematic.  GPO believes that it is in the best interest of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) and the majority of attendees to continue scheduling our Conference as a stand-alone meeting.         Virtual Depository Collections   Council recommends that GPO study the feasibility of a virtual depository library collection.  If feasible, Council further recommends that GPO draw on the expertise of the depository library community to serve their Congressional district through an online depository collection and supporting services by carrying out a pilot project.    Rationale :  In light of the increasing predominance of online resources in the FDLP, GPO should consider the possible modification of the depository relationship.  Exploring the concept of virtual depository collections with the depositories GPO could positively publicize the electronic transition, the fact that the majority of the new depository materials (60%) are now disseminated online, and the new roles that libraries have in building web and catalog resources for the distance learner/customer.    Response :   FDLP program managers have discussed the concept of a depository library selecting only those items made available in online format.  Nothing in the statute or practice categorically precludes such a selection profile  once a depository library has been established .  According to 44 U.S.C. 1909, libraries must have at least 10,000 books, other than government publications, to remain a depository library.  As the law has not changed, this is still a requirement, even for a library that wishes to adjust its item selection profile to receive only online titles.    GPO is working with the regional librarian at the Arizona State Library, with whom the idea for this recommendation originated, and the University of Arizona in Tucson, which has expressed interest in focusing on online only resources.  We have also had discussions with two other libraries in Arizona that may be interested in collecting only electronic resources once the project has been developed.  We will be working to develop an evaluative framework to ascertain that the needs of the immediate user community and the Congressional district are adequately met, and that a depository which establishes an all-electronic item selection is able to be evaluated in the Biennial Survey, self-study, and inspection on an equal and fair footing with a traditional depository.    The pilot project is expected to begin in fall 2002, with staff from the University of Arizona Library, the University of Arizona School of Information Resources and Library Science, and the Library Programs Service working together to develop plans to implement and evaluate the one-year project.  Periodic progress reports will be developed during this period.  A baseline initial assessment will be followed by informal subsequent assessments during the year, and a final assessment will take place by the end of the pilot project.  Council will be kept abreast of the progress of the pilot project on a regular basis.    Integrated Library System (ILS)   Council recommends that GPO provide a written update by the Spring 2002 Depository Library Council meeting on the progress of the potential acquisition of an Integrated Library System.    Rationale :  In the 1999 spring meeting Council recommended that GPO investigate the feasibility of acquiring an Integrated Library System.  Council continues to believe that benefits to both GPO and the depository community exist.  Additionally, GPO was receptive to the idea of an Integrated Library System but was unable to make a full resource commitment to an Integrated Library System acquisition due to its involvement with the Year 2000 compliance efforts.  It is also likely that the migration from GPOs use of a variety of legacy systems to a single Integrated Library System would help streamline internal processes as well as increase responsiveness to the Depository Community.      Response :   In the fiscal year 2002 appropriation, GPO received general approval from Congress for systems modernization.  LPS intends to acquire an up-to-date cataloging and library data management system.  Our goal is to decide what to purchase, and to commit the funds necessary to purchase a commercial off-the-shelf Integrated Library System (ILS) within the next year.    LPS operations will undoubtedly change to make use of the capabilities of a new system, although all of the details of such changes cannot be predicted at this time.  LPS expects to use the ILS to support cataloging, classification, acquisitions, serial check-in, preparation work for conversion contracts, library selection and address information, and to provide distribution information to the Lighted Bin System.    To date a working group of LPS staff has:         Looked at current systems in use by LPS and their functions.   Developed a statement of work to obtain the services of a library automation consultant.  The consultant will assist us with defining our user requirements and with developing the criteria for selecting between competing systems.   Begun to define system requirements.   Begun to define data migration strategies.   Begun investigating existing ILS offerings.   Begun investigating training opportunities to prepare for an ILS.   Queried other libraries that have obtained and implemented an ILS.   Received input from the depository library community regarding interface requirements and service needs.   Begun to work with Materials Management Service, Network Systems, the Office of Information Resources Management, and other GPO personnel.   Developed material to request project approval from the Joint Committee on Printing.          Superseded List   Council recommends that GPO develop principles that clearly articulate how depository libraries should manage editions of superseded, tangible materials for which the current edition now appears solely in an electronic format.  Further, Council urges GPO to provide links to URLs in the electronic Superseded List.    Rationale :  Because the last compilation of the Superseded List is approximately 5 years old and more products once distributed in a tangible format have migrated to the electronic environment, the need for an updated Superseded List is critical.  Council believes that a statement directing the management of tangible superseded material now available in an electronic only format is necessary, particularly when the tangible material is less than 5 years old.  Linking URLs will assist depository libraries in the maintenance of material that is superseded on a regular basis.    Council appreciates the time and effort of GPO and volunteers from the depository community and is looking forward to the new, electronic list in the very near future.    Response :   LPS has worked with depository librarians to update the printed 1996 Superseded List, and the revised version is available on the FDLP Desktop at <  http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/pubs/suplist/index.html  > .  This data is an extension of the 1996 List as records from the revised Superseded List are complemented with information from the Substitution List.    LPS has revised the preliminary pages of the 1996 Superseded List to develop the ""FDLP Guidelines for Determining Superseded Materials,"" available at < http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/coll-dev/supersede.html >.  The Guidelines provide guidance on product retention for superseded titles, including the case when a tangible title has been superseded by an online product.  These Guidelines were also published in the March 15,   2002 issue of Administrative Notes.    For the future, LPS is investigating the possibilities of attaching supersession information and other FDLP-specific data to the bibliographic records in the ILS.     Awareness   Council recommends that GPO expand efforts to increase awareness among library administrators as well as library users of the unique contributions and benefits of the FDLP in the continuously changing information environment.    Rationale :  Council recognizes that diverse constituencies may be unaware of the Programs contributions and benefits.  In light of recent trends that include more information offered virtually and a decline in the number of depository libraries nationally, increased promotional and marketing efforts are vital.  These efforts should not only be aimed at the various constituencies in the library community (administrators, reference staff, and bibliographers) but at the faculty, business, students, government, and the general public.    Respon se :  In early November 2001 a GPO working group was convened to develop a marketing strategy to increase awareness of the FDLP among various constituencies.  Led by the Chief of the Promotion and Advertising Branch, with representation from Library Programs Service (LPS) and the Office of Electronic Information Dissemination Services (EIDS), the Group has drafted a marketing plan around the theme ""U.S. Government Information: Make the Connection at Federal Depository Libraries.""    Inspections     Council recommends that GPO continue to reorient the depository ""inspection"" process as mandated in 44 U.S.C. 1909 to a more positive learning and training experience.  Whenever possible, the designated inspector should request that a representative from the depositorys regional and/or a local peer expert be included as part of the visiting team.  Moreover, GPO should train inspectors how to conduct sessions with ranking library officials to the best advantage for depository operations.    Rationale :  Council recognizes concerns among certain libraries regarding the inspection process, noting that nomenclature and emphasis may contribute to a negative perception.  It is the sense of Council that a change in the use of the word ""inspection"" to a more positive term, such as ""site visit"" may facilitate the sharing of expertise, best practices, and other positive outcomes.  These outcomes can be further served by requesting the presence of a regional or local peer expert during the visit, as that person can provide support for the depository coordinator.  Finally, Council believes that specialized training will allow inspectors to communicate with library officials on a more equal basis.     Response :   The depository library inspection is the ""firsthand investigation of conditions"" required of the Superintendent of Documents in 44 U.S.C. 1909.  The ""firsthand investigation"" or site visit has two major components.  GPO staff act as consultants to the depository staff and administration, offering insights about best practices and suggesting alternatives in the operation of the depository.  GPO staff also examine the depository to ascertain compliance with fundamental program requirements, such as free public access and proper maintenance of the depository collection.  GPO views the on-site inspection as a time for depository staff to learn more about the FDLP and the depository community, and GPO staff make every effort to emphasize the consultation function of the visits.      GPO always contacts the regional library prior to inspecting in that state, and encourages regional librarians to accompany the LPS inspector for on-site evaluations.  The regional librarian has always had the option of sending another person when he/she is not available on the day of the inspection.      Training depository library inspectors is an on-going process.  LPS is in the process of training two new inspectors, and will schedule training sessions as appropriate.  While the inspectors continue to look at all the areas shown in ""Preparing for a Library Inspection,"" there has been a change in emphasis from strict adherence to the  Guidelines ,  Federal Depository Library Manual and Supplements , and the  Instructions,  to a more results-oriented approach.  Emphasis is placed on accessphysical and bibliographicto depository resources located in the library and available via the Internet.  In response to this recommendation, a session entitled, ""Discussion Session: Inspections & Addition of Peer Experts to Accompany Inspectors for On-Site Library Inspections"" has been included as part of the Spring 2002 Council meeting.  This session builds upon several other training sessions and presentations on the inspections and self-study processes that have been included in the Federal Depository Library Conference and Council meetings.     Self-Studies   Council recommends that GPO assess the value and effectiveness of the self-study process for depository librarians and GPO.    Rationale :  Council would like to know whether the self-study process is working to improve depository library operations and the inspection process as anticipated by GPO and depository community.  Council also would like to know if the self-study adequately helps GPO determine whether or not a formal inspection is warranted.     Response :   In December 2001, libraries in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Michigan were requested to submit self-studies of their depository operations.  Most of the self-studies from those states have been received and LPS Depository Services staff are reviewing the studies as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the self-study process.  While the self-study has been helpful in helping new librarians understand the role of their depository collection in their library and the FDLP, it is an extremely time-intensive undertaking for all parties.  A minimum of six months elapses from the time a self-study is requested until the earliest date that the library could be inspected.  Libraries are generally given three months to return the self-study, then two months are taken to receive and evaluate the self-studies for a contiguous area, and then inspections are scheduled, providing at least four weeks advance notice for the libraries.    Out of 63 self-studies called for review, 60 libraries returned the self-study on time.  Three libraries have been contacted and advised their self-study submission is late.    In response to this recommendation, a session has been scheduled for the discussion of the self-study process and its relation to library inspections during the Regional Meeting at the Spring 2002 Council meeting.    Geographically Separate Backup for GPO Access   Council recommends that GPO proceed as quickly as possible to create a geographically separate backup for GPO Access and the Electronic Collection.  Council also recommends that GPO begin working toward a complete mirror site, with full content and functionality, for GPO Access and the Electronic Collection.    Rationale :  Preservation of electronic government publications in GPO archiving initiatives is vitally important for guaranteeing permanent public access to these core government publications and other content-rich government information resources.  The events of September 11 th  clearly demonstrate the strong need for redundancy of data storage at remote sites.  A complete geographically separate backup and mirror site will allow GPO to better serve the needs of a growing user base.    Response :   Pursuant to our goal of establishing a geographically separate mirror site and backup facility for GPO Access, an onsite inspection of potential locations in GPO facilities was recently completed. Based on what was learned, a cost benefit analysis is being performed to determine the optimal location for this new facility. When this analysis has been completed, the location for the new site will be selected and work will begin as soon as practicable.    In late 2001, in the aftermath of September 11, Congress provided $4 million to GPO in supplemental transfer authority for emergency preparedness (P.L. 107-117).  Establishing a geographically remote mirror site and backup facility for GPO Access will utilize a portion of these funds, in addition to other project funding from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Superintendent of Documents.  Beginning with the most frequently used GPO Access resources, GPO will steadily add to the resources and data at this facility until it is a complete mirror site for GPO Access. This will include the portion of the FDLP Electronic Collection Archive maintained by GPO.    Geographically Separate Backup for Partners   Council recommends that GPO investigate the feasibility of providing a geographically separate site for the FDLP partners and agency partners to store data contained on the partner sites.    Rationale :  If partners are responsible for locating their own geographically separate storage sites, GPO may or may not have easy access to the data or know where the backup is located in the event of a disruption at a partner site.  By providing a data storage site for the FDLP and agency partners, GPO enables the partners to store data contained on their sites in a geographically separate facility.  In the event of a disruption at a partner site, GPO can easily retrieve the stored data and assist the partner site with restoring public access to the data.    Response :   Two options for providing a geographically separated backup storage site are being investigated at this time.  GPO is currently investigating the establishment of a backup facility separate from GPO Central Office in Washington, DC, and as development of that facility progresses, possibilities may exist to include partner data.    GPO is also actively working with OCLC, Inc. on the establishment of OCLCs Digital Archive services.  GPO expects to store material in OCLCs Digital Archive with supporting preservation metadata, and could conceivably place partner material in this arrangement as well.     Both these options are developing rapidly, but some details remain to be clarified, particularly with regard to costs.  We will continue to monitor developments and communicate with Council and our partners as it is feasible and appropriate.    Distribution of Electronic Publications   Council recommends that GPO and a working group of Council examine the concept of establishing the systematic distribution of Federal government electronic publications through the FDLP in order to assure further redundancy in free public access to that body of information.    Rationale :  In response to concerns for permanent public access to electronic government information expressed by some in the depository community, Council believes that GPO and the Council working group should examine the following issues:  legal issues; issues including technology; authenticity and data integrity; feasibility; and the nature and level of interest in pursuing the proposed distribution concept in the depository community.    Response :   LPS staff is participating in the discussions of the Electronic Distribution Working Group that is examining the concept of establishing the systematic distribution of Federal Government electronic publications through the FDLP.    One of the Working Groups tasks is to develop a model or a proposal describing the ideal system for the distribution of electronic publications to depository libraries.  The proposal should address the purpose and goals of electronic document distribution through the FDLP, the short and long-term responsibilities of participating libraries, and technological issues including authenticity, security, and data integrity.    GPO has reviewed the legal issues for an FDLP electronic publication distribution system.  The salient point is that the law governing the FDLP has not changed.  Consequently, the responsibilities of libraries for their depository collections have not changed either. Therefore, under existing law every regional depository would be required to participate, and would have to permanently preserve, maintain, and provide access to every electronic publication in the FDLP.  This requirement may place a disproportionate burden on regional depositories in an area of responsibility and development that differs significantly from earlier expectations.  The impact of this must be addressed in any proposal.    One of the Working Groups tasks is to determine the nature and level of interest in pursuing the proposed distribution concept.  It has been suggested that libraries be surveyed as to whether they favor a program of electronic distribution that emulates the traditional FDLP for tangible publications.  Before any such survey can be responsibly conducted, the Working Group must clarify what responsibilities would be incumbent upon participating libraries from a program designed in accordance with existing law.  Library administrations should not be expected to commit their libraries' resources to an electronic version of the traditional FDLP without knowing the scope of their responsibilities.    Shared Bibliographic Information    Council recommends that GPO appoint a working group to examine options for Federal Depository Libraries to share bibliographic information about government publications with GPO Cataloging Branch with the goal of sharing this cataloging information with all participants in the FDLP via GPO cataloging records.  Options to be considered might include:       Sharing information to aid in the identification, description, and subject cataloging of Federal government publications via the process developed for the Electronic Publications Working Group;     A pilot project in which national libraries would contribute cataloging records for online publications to GPO Cataloging Branch; and     A pilot project in which other Federal Depository Libraries would contribute cataloging of Federal publications to GPO Cataloging Branch.      For options 2) and 3), only libraries currently qualified to participate in the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC) would be eligible for participation in pilot projects.    Rationale :  Council appreciates the panel discussion by representatives of the Program for Cooperative Cataloging held at this Depository Library Conference.  This presentation stimulated discussions of the several options for Federal Depository Libraries to share cataloging records or bibliographic information needed to create cataloging records with other FDLP participants via GPO cataloging records.  A working group is needed to examine the feasibility of these options, weighing the benefits of augmenting the cataloging available for government information products outside the current GPO cataloging workflow and distribution of that cataloging to FDLP participants against possible negative impact on GPO Cataloging Branchs workload.      Response :   GPOs Cataloging Branch, as the national authority for cataloging U.S. Government publications in all formats, actively supports the goal of sharing bibliographic information with other libraries through participation in all national cooperative cataloging programs.  However, the administration of a cooperative cataloging program requires a different level of commitment and resources than does participation in such projects.  Councils recommendation to establish a working group to investigate options for sharing bibliographic data is not feasible at this time, in part because the acquisition and implementation of an ILS may bring significant changes in LPS ability to share bibliographic data.    Not only is LPS devoting significant resources to planning for and acquiring an ILS, but LPS lacks sufficient personnel to establish and successfully work with such a group.  The Cataloging Branch has experienced a serious loss of staff and has yet to replace a number of essential staff members.  Within the past twelve months the Branch has lost both of its section chiefs (one to promotion, one to retirement) and 30% of its catalogers (all to promotions elsewhere).  The Cataloging Branchs current top priority is to address this crisis of recruitment and retention, and LPS is working closely with GPOs Office of Personnel Service to develop solutions.    GPO intends to defer any action on this recommendation until such time as LPS Integrated Library System is in place, and the Cataloging Branch is fully staffed.   However, this deferral should not impede depository or other libraries from joining together to share bibliographic data, as the panel discussion suggested during the October 2001 Federal Depository Library Conference.

It is in the context of this mission that the library provides            access to the Internet and other electronic information resources.            A. Disclaimer           The Internet is a global network of computers with no central organizational            structure or control. It provides a gateway to millions of local, national,            and international sources of information. While the Internet generally            provides access to a wealth of information that is valuable and enlightening,            the user may find information that is controversial, offensive, disturbing,            erroneous, or illegal. It is the responsibility of the user to determine            the appropriateness, accuracy, and usefulness of the information accessed            through the Internet. The provision of access to electronic information            by the Library does not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the information.                     As with access to other materials and services of the Library, any            restriction of a minor's access to, or use of the Internet and other            electronic resources is the responsibility of the minor's parents or            legal guardians. Parents or guardians concerned about their child's            use of the Internet are encouraged to read and share with their children            ""My Rules of Online Safety."" This is included in an excellent publication            from the National Center for Missing and Exploited children, entitled            Child Safety on the Information Superhighway. Parents who are concerned            about their children's use of electronic resources should provide guidance            to their children.            The sources linked directly to the Library's home page are chosen in            accordance with its Materials Selection and Accessibility Policies (Chapter            IV of the Policies). Beyond this the Library does not control information            accessed through the Internet. Because the Internet is so dynamic, the            Library is not responsible for changes in content of sources to which            it links, nor for the content of sources accessed through secondary            links.            The Library will maintain an abbreviated version of this disclaimer            on its Internet home page.            B. Internet User Guidelines            Library users who access the __________________ Library's Internet            and other electronic services are responsible for using them in an ethical,            legal, and considerate manner. Examples of prohibited usage include,            but are not limited, to:            Using the Internet workstations for any illegal purposes  Engaging            in any activity that is deliberately offensive or creates an intimidating            or hostile environment   Representing oneself as another person or using            the Internet to transmit obscene, threatening, or harassing materials              Viewing, displaying, or printing explicit graphical images in violation            of Texas Law: PC 43.24, Sale, Distribution, or Display of Harmful Material            to Minor  Damaging or destroying equipment, software, or data belonging            to the Library or to other users, including adding, altering, or deleting            files on Library workstations, hard drives, or other Library computer            equipment  Violating computer system or network integrity, including            attempts to bypass network security functions, obtain passwords, or            alter the configuration of Library workstations in any way  Violating            copyright laws. U.S. Copyright law (Title 17, U.S. Code) prohibits reproduction            or distribution of copyrighted materials, except as permitted by principles            of ""fair use."" Responsibility for any possible copyright infringement            lies solely with the user. The __________________ Library expressly            disclaims any liability or responsibility resulting thereof.            C. Conditions of Use            To ensure that these Internet and electronic resources are provided            fairly and equitably, the following conditions of use shall apply:                         Internet workstations will be available during the Library's normal              hours of operation until ten minutes prior to closing             Usage is on a first-come, first-served basis              The Library reserves the right to set time limits for individual              sessions of use so that monopolizing of Internet resources is minimized              Internet printing charges will be the same as other Library printing              and copying charges              Users may download information from the Internet to a 3.5"" IBM-compatible              formatted computer disk. However, the user is cautioned regarding              computer viruses. The Library is not responsible for damage to the              user's disk or computer, for any loss of data, damage, or liability              that may occur from use of the Library's Internet services              Users shall not attempt to upload, install, set up, run, or execute              any program or software not authorized by the Library on any of the              Library's computer workstations or systems. This prohibition does              not, however, restrict users from uploading text documents, such as              resumes, from their own disks to distant Internet sites.              The Library reserves the right to limit or restrict Internet applications                    return to top            D. Confidentiality of Use    Transaction logs and any other            information that can be used to identify a user with specific data,            files, programs, or other electronic materials are covered by the _______________            Library's Confidentiality of Library Patron Information (Chapter III            of the Policies.) However, the Library reserves the right to monitor            and/or report activities as needed to maintain security and usability            of the Internet workstations and the systems to which they are connected.            In addition, users are advised that because privacy is technically difficult            to achieve, electronic transactions and files could become public.    E.            Staff Assistance    Due to the various skill levels and time constraints            of Library scheduling, Internet trained staff may not always be available            for personal assistance. Library staff cannot provide in-depth training            on Internet computer usage or personal computer usage. Staff may, however,            be able to use professionally acquired skills to provide suggestions            and tips for searching.        F. Sanctions    Library users who violate the Internet User Guidelines, or          who refuse to comply with the Conditions of Use, may be removed from the          Library and may have their Library privileges revoked. The Librarian in          Charge has the authority to terminate a user's Internet session in accordance          with these sanctions. This decision may be appealed to the Assistant Director          and then to the Director. The decision of the Director is final.    Violations          of the policies described above regarding the legal and ethical use of          the Library's electronic resources will be dealt with in a serious and          appropriate manner. Illegal acts involving the Library's Internet and          electronic resources may also be subject to prosecution by local, state,          or federal authorities.    G. Responsibility and Authority    Final responsibility          and authority for Internet and electronic information access rests with          the Director of Library Services, who will operate within a framework          of policies and principles adopted by the City Council of __________________.          The staff will operate under the Director's delegated authority.    The Library          is authorized to develop such procedures, guidelines, and rules as may          be necessary to carry out these policies. Further, the Library is authorized          to utilize appropriate technologies to address the implementation of these          policies.            Reviewed by the ________ Library Board on 2.9.98 and recommended for adoption.

Training Users                    ""Mary, are you telling me you didn’t know chatting is against            the rules?""           ""Yes, ma’am,"" Mary replied, sounding very contrite.           ""But you read the acceptable use policy?""           ""Yes, ma’am.""           In exasperation, the library director pulled a copy of the AUP out            of the acrylic stand of training brochures sitting just to the right            of the monitor. She opened it and spread it out on the desk in front            of Mary, putting her index finger below the bold-faced letters.           ""You didn’t see these statements in bold-faced type?""           ""No, ma’am.""           ""How do you explain that, Mary?""           ""Maybe it got updated sometime after I read it?"" the girl            offered hopefully.                 You’ve taken the time to learn about dangers lurking around your network          if you don’t secure it. You’ve done some planning and created a security          policy, working it in with your Acceptable Use Policy where applicable.          You’ve identified the security measures most likely needing implementation          on your network. You’ve hired someone to come onsite and implement those          measures. You’ve arranged for a security audit. Seems like you’re close          to being able to go home and get a good night’s sleep.         What’s left?         Just a little training.         Content         Security training isn’t like learning a software application. It’s not          like learning to sew or ride a bike. It’s not a step-by-step thing, and          it’s not skill gained by repetition or judgment. Security training is          more a process of familiarization. After determining security goals in          your security policy and listing the rules of use, it’s time to impart          these to your staff and your patrons.         Staff Rules & Guidelines         Be sure that everyone on staff is familiar with the rules and procedures          that apply to their positions. For example, make sure the person in charge          of system backups understands:                                how to operate the backup software                                  the procedure related to rotating backup media (e.g., which Friday              tape is to be used next, or when to take a tape offsite)                                  how to review the backup log the morning after each backup and remove              the tape                                  report any problems                                  schedule and conduct a test restore 2-4 times per year                           In these cases, training the person also means checking their work occasionally          to make sure it is done as specified.         The remainder of the training relates to the sensible guidelines of making          sure sensitive information isn’t inadvertently compromised. Here are common          guidelines taught to staff members.                                Always log out from the server when finished performing administrative              tasks. Lock the console if necessary.                                  Those staff members who know the Administrator password should log              onto their workstations using their personal accounts unless the task              they are performing specifically requires Administrator privileges.              (Always assign each staff member and volunteer a personal account              with appropriate privileges for routine use.) They should log off              immediately after completing the task(s) requiring Administrator privileges.              Further work can be done after logging back in under their personal              accounts.                                   Do not log onto the Administrator account from a public workstation.                                  When logging on as Administrator, be sure no unauthorized persons              are observing.                                  Keep passwords secret. Since everyone is assigned a personal account,              there is no need to reveal personal or system passwords to anyone.              This especially includes technicians or competent-sounding phone callers.              Staff must obtain approval from the library director or his/her designee              before revealing passwords or other network-related information to              a representative of a computer company arriving at the library to              do tech work.                                  Keep network configuration information (IP addresses, for example)              confidential. Obtain approval from library administration before revealing              such information to any third party.                                  Create strong passwords, as specified in the Library’s password policy              (see Part III for an example), when creating or changing passwords.                                  Memorize your password. If it’s a password you may forget, write              it down on a sheet of regular paper (with no reference to the account              it corresponds to) and store the sheet in an innocuously labeled manila              folder and file it.                                  Do not use credit cards to purchase products online with any library              computer.                                                                              return to top                 Public User Rules & Guidelines         Rules and guidelines are generally different for public users of your          network. If your library offers individual accounts to patrons (not many          do at this writing), the first two items below should be included; otherwise          they can be deleted. Most of the other items are warnings about using          the Internet safely in a public environment.                                Keep your account password secret. Since everyone is assigned a personal              account, there is no need to reveal your password to anyone.                                  When changing your password, create a strong password as described              in the Library’s password policy.                                  Be cautious about submitting personal information to sites on the              Internet; personal information submitted as part of a web-based form              may be stored on computer’s hard drive in the form of a ""cookie""              and the privacy of such information cannot be guaranteed. Never use              a credit card to purchase products online from a library computer.                                  The following services are not available through the Library’s Internet              connection (include a list of these services, such as chat and e-mail              use)                                  Read the following documents (list preferred web sites or library              materials here), which describe safe practice in the use of Internet              resources.                                  When you complete your Internet session, exit the web browser to              clear the browser’s cache, history, and URL lists.                           Monitored Use         In order to maintain a secure network, it is important to monitor specific          user actions on the network. Monitoring specific patron use of resources          is not often done in libraries. It has been important in our work to assure          patron’s privacy in regard to their use of materials. In the case of computer          networks, however, it is necessary to strike a balance between the patron’s          right to privacy and the library’s right to protect its resources for          the use of all patrons.         Part of the library’s security program is to determine what specific          actions or activities should and will be monitored. The program must also          determine the procedures used to monitor these activities and how violations          of policy will be reported and resolved. When these decisions are made,          it is then imperative to inform staff and public users how their usage          will be monitored.         The library is encouraged to include a disclaimer providing details related          to the monitoring of network activity on all training materials, acceptable          use policies, and other public documents. (A sample statement is included          on the next page; it is provided for illustrative purposes only. Be sure          to have the library’s legal counsel review and approve all such statements          before adopting them for use.) The disclaimer works in tandem with the          custom logon banner recommended in the  Network Security Checklist           (a sample is provided in Chapter 8 on pages 98-99) to notify patrons that          not all uses of the network are anonymous or welcomed.                     Use of the Library network is a privilege, not a right.  All            network activity is monitored for illegal and unauthorized use. While            the Library keeps no permanent records of particular materials viewed            by patrons, any attempts to access restricted services are noted. The            Library reserves the right to refuse service to anyone engaged in illegal            or unauthorized activity as specified in its Security Policy and its            Acceptable Use Policy.            Specifically, the following actions are monitored:                                                      all attempts to access the Administrator account               attempts to access restricted areas of the network server or                local workstations               attempts to copy unauthorized software or utilities onto a                server or local workstation               attempts to run unauthorized software or utilities stored on                a server, a local workstation, or on a personal diskette               public workstations are configured to operate without providing                access to a ""command line"" (also called a DOS session).                Patrons observed running a DOS session will be considered to be                running unauthorized software.               Other actions (as they are identified) harmful to the provision                of network services to all patrons.                                                  When confirmed by library staff, unauthorized attempts to access            restricted resources, whether successful or unsuccessful, shall result            in loss of privilege as indicated by policy.                 There may be other activities that need to be monitored. However, given          the library’s need to protect its patrons’ privacy in their use of resources,          such activities are anywhere from difficult to impossible to monitor.          These activities include, but are not limited to:                                sending threatening or harassing e-mail to others,                                                                to the President of the United States (possible)                                        to any prominent person (very difficult)                                        or any other Internet user (next to impossible)                                                              using chat or other multi-person communication resources in an illegal              way (almost impossible)                                  breaking into government or banking networks (difficult)                           If these activities are an extreme concern, the only common, practical          method for most libraries to use in restricting them is filtering software,          although it is also possible to limit access through the router, firewall,          or ISP’s connection. For many libraries this is an untenable solution.         Timing         Like most training, staff and patrons need to be taught these guidelines          and rules of conduct as soon as the network is functional. This means          planning an orientation session and software training. Optimally, the          training plan needs to be developed well before the network implementation.         If the network is already operational when security topics are addressed,          an orientation and ""re-certification"" of user access is recommended.         My recommendation is to conduct a short staff and volunteer orientation          session first, explaining the terms of use of library computers and the          network, allowing questions to be asked and issues to be raised. Basic          training in the use of any new software can be conducted separately.         For public users, the orientation session and software training can be          combined and be presented in small groups at scheduled times.                                                            return to top           Continue            to Part II                                                                                                                                         SITE NAVIGATION TEXT LINKS             Agency            Info  |  General            Interest  |  Librarians               |               Govt            Agencies    |               Catalogs            & Searches            Our Publications    |               News               |               TRAIL            |  Texas            State Library Home Page                          Contact            Us             | Site Index              |  Policies            & Disclaimers  |  Webmaster"
GX245-73-13817654	Public                Access to Electronic Information Networks                                                  To                    download this policy document to modify for your locale, right                    click here and select “Save target as….”                                                                                                      Electronic Networks and the Library’s Mission               Libraries make it possible for citizens to have access to the information                they need to make informed decisions. As a member of the Illinois                Library and Information Network (ILLINET), the XYZ Public Library                is committed to networking, which represents good public policy                by maximizing the use of the resources of all types of libraries.                Every library user benefits from expanded access to information                beyond the four walls of a single library building.               The XYZ Public Library and all ILLINET libraries use electronic                information networks such as the Internet for a variety of purposes:                                                  1.                    Access to shared automation                    systems that provide bibliographic access to the collections                    of the local library and libraries in the region and across                    the state.                                                    2.                    Access to the wealth                    of information resources available via the Internet.                                                    3.                    Access to general and                    specialized shared licensed databases available to ILLINET member                    libraries through regional and statewide cooperative programs.                                              Internet electronic mail service is available to patrons in libraries                that elect to offer this service. In many areas of Illinois, regional                community information networks are operational and offer library                patrons access to Internet electronic mail and related services.               Relationship to Other Library Policies               The XYZ Public Library’s Policy for Access to Electronic Information                Networks is part of the library’s overall policy structure                and should be interpreted in conjunction with other existing policies.                Copies of all library policies are available upon request from a                library staff member.               “Global” Versus “Local” Resources               Most resources available via the Internet and other electronic                information networks are “global” resources rather than                “local” resources. The library does not and cannot control                the information content available through global resources such                as information obtained from outside sources via the Internet. Internet                resources enhance and supplement resources that are available locally                within a library. Library users must be aware that this library                does not exercise control over information obtained via the Internet                and must keep in mind the following points when evaluating information                obtained via the Internet:                                                  1.                    Information obtained                    via the Internet may or may not be reliable and may or may not                    be obtained from a reliable source.                                                     2.                    Information obtained                    via the Internet may or may not be accurate.                                                     3.                    Information obtained                    via the Internet may or may not be current and up to date.                                                    4.                   Links to information                    on the Internet may not always be valid, and particular information                    sites on the Internet may sometimes be unavailable, and this                    unavailability often occurs unpredictably.                                                    5.                    Certain information                    obtained via the Internet may be considered controversial by                    some library patrons.                                              The XYZ Public Library urges library patrons to be informed consumers                and carefully evaluate information obtained via the Internet. Library                staff may be available to assist patrons in making judgments about                the reliability or currency of certain types of Internet information                sources, but are unable to provide definitive analysis of particular                sources due to the extremely large variety and volume of information                available via the Internet.               This library is not responsible for damages, indirect or direct,                arising from a library patron’s use of Internet information                resources.               Library Patrons’ Rights               Library patrons have certain rights with respect to use of electronic                information networks such as the Internet. This library will work                with other libraries in the Illinois Library and Information Network                to preserve and protect these rights, subject to limitations imposed                by licensing and payment agreements with database providers.               Library patrons have the right to confidentiality and privacy in                the use of electronic information networks to the extent possible                given certain constraints, such as proximity of other patrons and                staff in public access settings.               Library patrons have the right to equitable access to electronic                information networks.               Library patrons have the right to access and read all library service                policies and discuss questions with appropriate library staff.               Patron Assistance and Instruction               The XYZ Public Library’s staff may provide assistance to patrons                in the use of electronic information networks as time and staff                knowledge permits. Printed and online documentation and instructions                are available at or near points of service. Formal instruction in                particular aspects of electronic information network use may be                available.                 Use of Equipment and Networks               The XYZ Public Library requires that library patrons using electronic                information networks such as the Internet do so within the guidelines                of acceptable use. The following activities are unacceptable:                                                  1.                    Use of electronic information                    networks for any purpose which results in the harassment of                    other users,                                                    2.                    Destruction of, damage                    to, or unauthorized alteration of the library’s computer                    equipment software or network security procedures,                                                    3.                    Use of electronic information                    networks in any way which violates a Federal or State law,                                                    4.                   Use of electronic information                    networks in any way which violates licensing and payment agreements                    between [this library] and network/database providers,                                                     5.                    Uunauthorized duplication                    of copy-protected software or violation of software license                    agreements,                                                    6.                    Violation of system                    security,                                                    7.                    Behaving in a manner                    that is disruptive to other users, including but not limited                    to overuse of computer equipment which serves to deny access                    to other users.                                               Children’s Access to Electronic Information Networks               The XYZ Public Library supports the right of all library users                to access information and will not deny access to electronic information                networks based solely on age.               This library recognizes that the electronic information networks                such as the Internet may contain material that is inappropriate                for children. Parents are expected to monitor and supervise their                children’s use of the Internet. Library staff are unable to                monitor children’s use. Parents are encouraged to discuss with                their children issues of appropriate use and electronic information                network safety.               Library Procedures Relating to Electronic Networks               This library has developed certain procedures to assist staff and                patrons in the use of electronic information resources. These procedures                include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following:                                                  1.                    Time limits for access                    to allow use of resources by the maximum number of library patrons,                                                    2.                    Cost recovery for printouts                    using the library’s computer equipment,                                                     3.                    Priority usage for accessing                    the library’s online catalog,                                                     4.                   Specific instructions                    for downloading including compliance with virus protection measures,                                                    5.                    Restrictions on the                    use of personal software on library computer equipment,                                                    6.                    A registration and use                    agreement form which must be completed prior to usage.                                               Breach of Policy               Violation of any aspect of this policy may result in the loss of                library privileges.                             Electronic                Information Networks Registration and User Agreement               Name (please print)                                                  ___________________________                    Last                                      ___________________________                    First                                              Registration and User Agreement                                                  1.                    I have read the policies                    concerning the use of the XYZ Public Library’s Internet                    computer and agree to abide by the policies.                                                     2.                    I agree to pay any repair                    or replacement costs of equipment or software damaged by myself                    or by minors for whom I am responsible.                                                    3.

As offshore outsourcing of these services becomes more accepted and prevalent, customers are also becoming more discriminating with their choices of vendors and locations in which to do business. The purpose of this External Market Analysis is to provide background information and specific analysis regarding the ITES and offshore outsourcing industries, for use by the Government of Bangladesh and the USAID Mission in Dhaka to assess the country's competitive position in these industries. The study provides an overview of the outsourcing industry, including the offshore outsourcing market. It addresses the various factors involved in the outsourcing decision, including attributes that determine country and company competitiveness. Lastly, it analyzes several ITES segments in which Bangladesh could compete based on the strength of its current assets that enable the industry, and the severity of constraints present that inhibit growth. 1.2 Major Findings  The overall market size of IT-Enabled Services is enormous, and Bangladesh has the potential to obtain a share  even a small fraction of this market could result in a substantial number of jobs and meaningful export diversification for the country. In fact, there are several potential ITES segments in which Bangladesh could compete, such as Data Processing and Conversion, Geographic Information Systems, and Software Development. Its competitive strengths lie in its relative lower costs and production-oriented labor force. Opportunities also exist in niche geographic areas such as the European market. Competitiveness potential would increase significantly, however, if constraints are addressed. These constraints include the high costs of telecommunications, the limited experience of the labor force, and the lack of awareness and/or negative image of Bangladesh as a country. These obstacles are clearly areas which the Government of Bangladesh could address to spur growth and increase the country's competitiveness in the international arena.  1  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  2 2.1  The Offshore Outsourcing Market for ITES Definition of ""IT Enabled Services""  Information Technology-Enabled Services, or ""ITES"", involve business processes and services that extensively utilize components of information communication technology (""ICT""1) such as software, hardware and the Internet. As opposed to the manufacturing industry where products are physically visible, the ""raw materials"" in the ITES industry are data, information and knowledge. The industry is often referred to as a ""knowledge-based"" industry; as such, the products and services provided are less tangible. Outsourcing and ITES have been linked as an industry sector in recent years, as more companies (particularly in North America and Europe) determine business processes that are important but not vital to their key objectives or core competencies, e.g. back office operations. As competitiveness in a global scale applies pressure on corporate margins, the drive to outsource less ""mission critical"" business units has created a robust outsourcing industry. The following are not included in the definition of ITES, despite these enterprises' use of ICT: any manufacturing; local branches of global businesses (e.g. banks); and virtual businesses that exist only on the Internet. It is also important to note that although the term ""IT Enabled Services"" leads with the phrase ""IT"", many business processes within this sector would not be classified as technology businesses. Financial accounting services, for example, are typical administrative functions that fall within ITES but are not within the technology sector (like software), although accounting back offices utilize IT tools such as high-end accounting databases. 2.2 2.2.1 Fundamentals of the ITES and Outsourcing Industry IT-Enabled Services and the Outsourcing Industry  Opportunities for IT-Enabled Services exist throughout a company's business operations, also known as the ""value chain"": Process Product Development Production, Service Delivery Potential IT-Enabled Service Market research, data gathering Data mining and analysis Engineering design Pre-production; layout and graphic design Data conversion Publishing Records and transcriptions  1  ""ICT"", Information & Communications Technology: Electronic means of capturing, storing and communicating information. Modern ICT generally includes telephones, fax, photocopiers, computer hardware and software, and the Internet (e-mail and Web).  2  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  Process Distribution, Sales and Marketing  Customer Service  Finance, Accounting and Legal Administration Human Resources Administration  Potential IT-Enabled Service Logistics, inventory tracking Sales support Content, web development Outbound marketing, e.g. telemarketing Customer care, e.g. call centers Insurance claims Technical support E-mail help Data capture, conversion, processing Billing, payables, general ledger Record keeping Transcriptions Data, forms handling and capture Training, including remote education Payroll processing Employee benefits services  Many of these processes do not necessarily have to be physically based in headquarters or with decision-makers and can therefore be delivered remotely and by an outside provider. Processing and delivery can be:  Transmitted over private and/or secured public networks, and/or  Provided by an external party  contractor, subsidiary or joint venture Typical outsourced ITES will have some or all of the following characteristics:  Standardization  the process is based on clearly defined rules and measurable service levels  Simple interfaces  because of standardization, the required operation can be conveyed in pre-formatted templates or workflows to facilitate training and delivery  Legacy  the data and information are dated (from the past) and no longer pertain to current business operations, but may still be required for research, historical, legal or other purposes  Large scale, low maintenance  the requirement of abundant workers to complete pre-defined tasks, e.g. Y2K conversion 2.2.2 Industry Statistics  With Y2K conversions behind them, corporate executives continue to fuel the growth of outsourcing by seeking savings and other benefits as well as identifying more business operations to outsource. The following are highlights of statistics from the Outsourcing Institute2, a New York-based professional association of outsourcing executives, and other sources as noted:  2  Outsourcing Institute, Dun & Bradstreet, Outsourcing Index 2000 3  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis   American corporations spent $340 billion for outsourced services in 2001, a growth rate of 15% from 2000 The types of outsourced services are becoming more diverse, including areas that would be IT-enabled such as Customer Service and Human Resources administration. Of the services described below, 78% would relate to ITES (if manufacturing, real estate and transportation were excluded).

The following are estimates from the McKinsey/NASSCOM analysis of this sector5:  3 4 5  IDC Research, as quoted by Outsourcing Institute Meta Group, ""Offshore Outsourcing Fuelled by Budget Pressures,"" 23 January 2002 ""The Indian I.T.

The Outsourcing Institute lists the following as the most commonly cited reasons for outsourcing, based on a survey of outsourcing end users:  Reduce and control operating costs: By choosing outside providers with lower cost structures, a company reduces its own operating costs and risks. Outsourcing vendors may achieve lower cost structures from greater economies of scale, specialization, and/or access to a less expensive labor pool.  6  Gartner Group Dataquest, IT Services Market Statistics, October 2000 5  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  Improve company focus: Outsourcing non-mission critical operations allows a company to focus on its own core competencies and customer needs. Having others conduct processes that are not tied to the company's key business allows management to focus on more strategic and tactical objectives. Resources not available internally: Outsourcing is often a viable alternative to the costs and time required to build the needed capability in-house. This is especially true when time-to-market is a priority. Free resources for other purposes: With outsourcing of non-core business processes, a company's managers can direct both capital and human resources toward activities which are closer to the company's goal, e.g. developing new products or services for competitiveness, or seeking new markets in which to expand. Often, administrative or other ""overhead"" functions that do not directly contribute to a company's revenue and income goals (e.g. Human Resources administration) are good candidates for outsourcing. Access to world-class capabilities: Specialization breeds expertise for outsourcing providers; by working in one specific field across many clients and industries, they can build their competitive advantage from the experience. Additionally, they invest extensively in technology, research and human resources to remain continually up-to-date  something that would be costly for their own customers to do. Offshore Outsourcing        2.2.4  Offshore outsourcing entails business processes delivered from outside the corporation's home country. The industry has been substantially enabled by advancements in global ICT, and corporations' eagerness to find service providers at lower costs. Outsourcing of IT business processes became more realizable with telecommunications costs rapidly decreasing in various areas of the globe, combined with broadened bandwidth to transmit abundant amounts of data. IT-related outsourcing grew specifically from budget constraints and the need to free higherskilled professionals for strategic projects. The industry grew at a quick pace and to a high level during the Y2K and Euro conversions of the late 1990's, when India became a prominent player and leader in this arena as a low-cost labor provider (of programmers). With experience, acceptance for offshore outsourcing has grown and the types of work being outsourced have become more diverse. 2.2.5 Advantages and Disadvantages of Offshore Outsourcing  With years of experience in offshore outsourcing, corporations have become more knowledgeable of the pros and cons in sending business processes and IT projects overseas7:  7  ""Offshore is Not Offhand"", Kathleen Goolsby, Outsourcing Center, January 2002 6  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis        Advantages Significant savings in labor costs Time zone differences  increases work hours (shortens production cycle) Corporate and country culture differences Qualities of skills Motivated workers who are career-oriented (lower turnover)        Disadvantages Additional upfront costs because of distance Time zone differences, can be difficult to manage Corporate and country culture differences Communication difficulties Contract jurisdiction if litigation becomes necessary  While telecommunications infrastructure and low-cost labor have enabled IT and ITES across the globe, the issues surrounding the management of offshore outsourcing relationships remain. Communication and culture differences are unique factors involved in knowledge- based industries, in which the end customer's expectations need to be clearly understood by the vendor. Companies are realizing with experience the importance of selecting the right vendor, of a properly structured contract, and the ongoing management of the outsourcing relationship.8  3 3.1  Key Enabling Factors for ITES Factors for Competitiveness  Country Level  When customers seek ITES offshore outsourcing suppliers, the supplier's country location often does not play a primary role in the customer's choice  except in terms of the following which consequently affect the overall outsourcing relationship:      costs that are passed-along to the customer the quality and reliability of service, which depends on skilled labor and dependable infrastructure the degree of safety and comfort for the customer's employees should it become necessary to post personnel at the vendor's location during stages of the outsourcing project the risk for foreign investment, in cases where the customer must incur capital outlays for property and equipment or enters into a joint venture, subsidiary or partnership agreements for mid- to high-end ITES, protection of intellectual property  Country-related factors for competitiveness could therefore be viewed as   Basic Requirements: essential factors that enable the ITES industry, and Positive Factors: favorable conditions that could provide the offshore outsourcer a competitive advantage in acquiring and maintaining customers, versus companies in other countries  8  Outsourcing Institute IT Index 2001 7  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis    Basic Requirements Established ICT infrastructure o Specifically, enabled connectivity with the international customer           Supply o o o  of workers Low labor costs Relevant skills Training aptitude           Business environment conducive to international customers o Stable country risk conditions (peace and order, political environment) o For higher end IT and ITES  intellectual property rights protection o Reasonable or competitive costs and ease of doing business              Positive Factors Low or declining ICT infrastructure costs, e.g. telecommunications costs, consistent with the regional or world market Reliability, e.g. high to 100% uptime of telecommunications, power supply Varied choices for connectivity Fast service delivery from providers Supporting infrastructure, e.g. transportation, housing complexes, tourist facilities Availability and continuity of supply Subject matter expertise already in place, to reduce training time and costs Language proficiency in host company's language Similarity or familiarity with host company's business practices and/or customer expectations Visible educational support, to ensure supply of workers Benchmarked competency or proficiency levels, e.g. certifications or international exams and competitions Reasonable labor union framework Tax incentives local suppliers of IT and ITES Simplified customs procedures Foreign investment privileges Intellectual property rights protection; anti-piracy laws and enforcement Presence of successful foreign enterprises and business partnerships Transparency; low level of corruption Minimal ""red tape"" and bureaucracy Open market policies by the government, visibly being practiced Favorable living conditions for expats; hospitality for visiting business partners Legal and regulatory framework with processes that do not pose undue risk for foreign investors  8  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis 3.2 Factors for Competitiveness  Company Level  Forty-four percent of companies surveyed by The Outsourcing Institute ranked ""vendor selection"" as the most important element for successful outsourcing. The Institute's IT Index 2001, a survey of participants in IT outsourcing, details the Top Factors in Vendor Selection, in order:  Price: Offshore providers can typically rely on less expensive labor and pass these savings on to their customers. Savings range from 30% to 60% of those in the United States. The caveat here is that there are costs, in terms of time and money, of managing the offshore relationship that could reduce these savings  sometimes significantly if the agreement is not structured or managed properly. Commitment to quality: With experience, companies that outsource have realized that relinquishing control of business processes could lead to quality issues that in the end hinder their effectiveness. An outsourcing provider's track record in its industry  backed by measurable results, references and/or international certification  becomes a key factor in whether or not it gets the business. To ensure quality, companies have increasingly included and monitored defined service level standards within their contracts. Commitment to quality essentially reflects the capabilities of management. Flexible contract terms: While the processes for outsourcing are typically standard and routine, business requirements can change that would require outsourcing suppliers to accommodate their customers. Flexible contract terms often work best in the buyer's favor; however, vendors might find themselves at a competitive disadvantage if flexibility is not demonstrated. Scope of resources: Outsourcing firms with breadth of resources in up-todate technology and supply of skilled labor possess competitive advantages over others. Reinvestment of profits to keep up with current infrastructure and subject matter expertise becomes necessary for outsourcing firms to sustain growth. Additional value-added capability: The constant advance of technology requires outsourcing firms to expand their capabilities to meet their customers' IT and information management needs. Since customers rely on outsourcers for their subject matter expertise (acquired from the outsourcers' investments in current technology and training), the ability to provide varied levels of capabilities also becomes an outsourcer's strength.          While these survey results were gleaned from IT end-users and providers, the above factors are also often quoted as requirements for the ITES vendor  especially in the areas of price and quality. Other factors often quoted include: familiarity with the overseas customer's business needs and expectations, cultural match, and location.  9  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis 3.3 How Bangladesh is Viewed as a Vendor  Most companies overseas lack awareness of Bangladesh as an IT services provider. According to Bangladeshi software company representatives who attended the CeBIT telecommunications and IT trade show in Germany, ""surprise"" is the frequent reaction of customers upon hearing of Bangladesh's efforts to supply IT services. Conversations with IT managers in the United States also reflect this lack of awareness of the country's business capabilities as a whole. The U.S. Trade Center in Dhaka serves as a resource for American companies conducting business (specifically, selling American goods) in Bangladesh, and publishes the Bangladesh Commercial Country Guide9 for those considering it. The country research exhibited in the document reflects experiences the Trade Center and American businesses have had in Bangladesh. The Guide reports the following observations regarding the business factors relevant to international companies:  Infrastructure o Inadequate and inefficient, specifically in power and telecommunications o Deteriorating power supply is hampering industrial growth Labor o Generally respond well to training o Inexpensive o Low productivity and low skills Business environment o Respectable growth o Good relations with the United States Political and regulatory environment and systems o Government has yet to fully push for open-market policies and reforms necessary for higher growth levels o Lack of transparency o Corruption at high levels, with Customs being the worst o Unnecessary licenses and permissions often required of foreigners, and then delivered slowly       While many of these factors relate mostly to overseas companies that would have financial investments at stake within the country, they paint an unfavorable general picture of Bangladesh as a country in which to do business. When competing in a global market where there are abundant choices of countries and companies as providers, the lack of awareness and poor opinions regarding Bangladesh are obstacles which require significant effort to overcome. 3.3.1 Case Study: Abiskar International Abiskar International, LLC Brian Lacey, the American founder and President of Abiskar International, established the data mining operations of his company in Dhaka  admittedly 9  U.S. Trade Center, ""Bangladesh Country Commercial Guide,"" 2001-2002 10  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis by chance and with much trial and error. He was seeking an inexpensive labor pool to provide the analytical services his company would in turn deliver as predictive modeling reports to U.S. credit card companies and supermarket chains. A Bangladeshi friend urged him to consider Bangladesh as a possible location, and Lacey used his limited funds to visit Dhaka. After some research and legwork, he found an acceptable level of talent in the computer science, business, and engineering colleges in Dhaka. Having encountered little ""red tape"" and bureaucracy, he opened the Abiskar office in Dhanmondi in 2000. Abiskar in Dhaka consists of an 8-person team of analysts and one country manager. Labor costs are 1/8 the cost of an American analyst; however these are offset by lower productivity of an estimated 50%. The company has managed to operate with a 64 kbps connection and two ISPs (for redundancy, since each ISP has predictable downtime). Downloading large data files from their American customers typically take all night, a situation that is currently ""manageable"" but would not be suitable if the company continues to grow. The company also operates with no land telephone lines at this time, choosing to use mobile phones instead of waiting for a BTTB line. Lacey admits that he knew almost nothing about Bangladesh when he chose to establish Abiskar's operations here. He also states that he had not researched nor visited other countries as options due to lack of funds. Still, his experience in Dhaka and Bangladesh results in his favorable perspective of operating his business here: he believes the country's strengths lie in its talented albeit limited labor pool, and the minimal bureaucracy he encountered. As for concerns, he believes the lack of intellectual property rights protection and the inadequate infrastructure are constraints to the country's development in the IT sector.  4  Market Segments: Size, Fundamentals, Opportunities  The External Market Analysis for ITES focuses on target segments that had been decided upon by key stakeholders in the Bangladesh IT services. Consensus was reached regarding how the highly diverse, sophisticated and complex ITES market would be defined, to develop initial hypotheses about where Bangladesh might be competitive10. Participants included representatives from the GOB Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the Bangladesh Computer Council, private sector associations such as the Bangladesh Computer Society, Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, several individual ITES firms, the JOBS project, and USAID.  10  ""Selection of Market Segments, Selection Process and Results,"" Bangladesh ITES Competitiveness Study, CARANA Corporation, February 2002 11  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis 4.1 4.1.1 Chosen ITES Segments for Bangladesh Criteria  The group used the following criteria to evaluate the ITES segments on which Bangladesh could focus its efforts: Competitiveness Potential    Availability of qualified human resources Availability of affordable and reliable technology Supportive policy environment, few policy, legal and regulatory barriers  Economic Impact    Potential Potential Potential linkages to reduce poverty, including creation of new jobs to grow economy through expansion of total Bangladeshi exports to modernize portions of the domestic economy through backward that create opportunity for other firms  Potential for successful implementation    4.1.2 Existence of a ""champion"" or other strong institutional support to undertake initiatives Relative ease of overcoming policy, legal, regulatory and infrastructure barriers Availability of government, private sector, or donor resources to support implementation Data Category  Low, Medium Tiers  These segments (Data Category: Low, Medium or High Tiers) were defined by the requirements primarily for labor and infrastructure. As types of ITES were identified, it became clear that there were strong similarities in these requirements to form clusters that were defined as Low, Medium or High based on the complexity of the process and the value added. The Customer Interaction Category, essentially involving customer service ""call centers"" was generally dismissed by the group because of the high telecommunications costs and the short supply of proficient English speakers. Exhibit A describes the Data Category and the ITES services contained within, including key factors that enable these segments. Based on the criteria above, the group concluded that Bangladesh could viably compete in the Data Category of ITES, specifically in the Low and Medium Tiers. With recognition to the prospects of the software development sector in the country, it was agreed that software development would also be included as a sector to be evaluated.  12  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  DATA CATEGORY Types of ITES MEDIUM Web development Programming Claims processing (insurance) Animation, Multimedia Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Engineering design; CAD Legal, Medical transcriptions Data digitization Data ""mining"" (research) LOW Data entry (key punching, basic data or voice conversion) Legacy documentation entry File conversions from/to electronic Directory entries (yellow/white pages)  LABOR    Specific subject matter knowledge Quality control, assurance Intermediate hardware and/or software usage skills English comprehension, as necessary Keyboarding skills Abilities to follow basic instructions for use of hardware and software Quality control    TECHNOLOGY High speed, reliable data links; broadband Up-to-date hardware and software, programming tools         Reliable data links to transfer data as needed    Within these Tiers, several service types have the worldwide market size that are more appealing for offshore outsourcing and also have requirements that Bangladesh could meet.

All of Decode's data conversion revenues are from overseas customers in the United States and Europe. Customers were originally obtained from marketing agreements with a nonresident Bangladeshi (NRB); Decode principals have also participated in and secured contracts from European trade shows such as CeBIT. The company's connectivity consists of a dedicated broadband (64 kbps) cable line, which occasionally has to be backed up by local ISPs (using prepaid cards) when the line fails. Decode's competitive strength lies in the availability and flexibility of semi-skilled labor, and the significantly lower cost  it charges about  the per hour direct labor costs in the United States. Decode's management believes that marketing is the company's biggest challenge in obtaining more business. There is limited awareness or negative perceptions (e.g., floods) of Bangladesh, and the company has had to provide ""trial runs"" for free to prospective customers in order to obtain business. Once customers are obtained, however, they believe that the services they provide are competitive in the market and have resulted in their long-time operations since 1994. Management also believes there are better opportunities to compete in smaller niche markets such as Finland, Denmark and Germany. 4.2 4.2.1 Medium Tier Medical Transcriptions Market Size $15 billion, as estimated by HealthScribe CEO (industry data not readily available from U.S. government); Forecasted 20% growth p.a.

Success factors  Bangladesh Potential = Low 4.2.1.1 Case Study: Technosoft Transcription Limited Founded in March 2000, Technosoft Transcription operates a medical transcription company that recently laid off 50% of its staff due to lack of business from indirect and subcontracting sources.13 Challenges to the business are numerous, including: one-sided marketing agreements, concerns over quality standards, cost and availability of workers proficient in English. The majority of the company's customers are obtained through a U.S.-based ""matchmaker"" between American customers (hospitals, doctors' offices) and foreign transcription companies. Other revenues are derived from subcontracting agreements from Indian transcription firms. Without direct marketing agreements of its own, Technosoft has had little control over the amount of business it gets; additionally, margins and cash flow are squeezed from the commissions and receivables necessary in these arrangements. Disputes over quality measurements are common, further undermining profits and sometimes resulting in non-payment. Technosoft's director admitted that its Bangladeshi workers do not have ""natural English"" proficiency, and those that are more proficient typically would not settle for a transcriber's salary. The company is also concerned over the availability and cost of its internet connectivity; while it feels fortunate that it has access to cable, the speed of connection has been diminishing as more subscribers come online. As such, management believes India and Pakistan have had the cost advantage and are ""getting the lion's share"" of business. (Notes: another Dhaka-based company, DataTrek, recently closed its medical transcription operations for similar reasons. In addition to India and Pakistan, the Philippines is another country with lower telecommunications costs and a greater supply of workers proficient in English and medical-related terminology.) 13  Interview with Mr. Sharif N.

GSR Limited, based in Mohammadpur, Dhaka, was started in 2000 and provides GIS training and certification, and GIS services to a small pool of customers.14 The company has certified 130 GIS technicians during its two years of operations; these technicians are typically college graduates with diverse majors such as health, environment, geography, civil engineering and economics. The school currently has a waiting list, including from professionals in public works or health services seeking continuing education. The school's management is seeking to expand its offerings, including to prospective overseas students; the amount of ""hands-on"" GIS projects that can be found in Bangladesh could be positioned as useful training ground. Among these opportunities include GIS for health, environmental management, and GIS for decision makers. GSR's management and faculty have experience in spatial engineering and its applications to health care and population issues in Bangladesh. The company has provided services to international donor agencies in Dhaka, e.g. USAID and its study of HIV/AIDS outbreaks in Bangladesh. Costs of equipment and software are high.

As a participant at CeBIT, the company's founder Nurul Kabir stated that prospects were first surprised and then doubtful of the potential of Bangladesh as a software development vendor. To secure this German customer's business, the company offered to provide a prototype  without charge  which was favorably received. The application produces grocery shelf tags with bar codes, and is tied with the supermarket's inventory system. With written requirements and regular conference calls, TechnoVista developed the software application through the entire production cycle, and finally launched the product within budget and on time in February 2002. As a sign of the project's success, the German customer has awarded TechnoVista with seven more assignments. The company is projected to grow from 22 programmers to over 70 programmers this year. Kabir, while optimistic about prospects for his business and Bangladesh's software development sector, names numerous constraints to his company's operations. Specifically, as an example of the limitations of telecommunications in Bangladesh, the data transfer of the final source code to Germany failed numerous times over three days that the data ultimately had to be delivered on a compact disk and via international courier. Another constraint is the ""unfinished product"" of computer science and engineering students  TechnoVista invests another six months of training for its new hires. Kabir advocates strongly for internships and on-the-job training of these students prior to graduation. Lastly, the image of Bangladesh he believes needs to be addressed by the government with strong marketing support and presence in trade exhibits such as CeBIT, and a trade officer (nominated by the private sector) in the United States.  15  Interview with Mr. T.I.M.

While currently only 10% of outsourced services in the United States is sent overseas, the growth in business process outsourcing that are likely candidates for ITES and offshore outsourcing (such as financial accounting services, human resources administration, customer care services) ranges from 20% to 30% per year. NASSCOM McKinsey provides one estimate of the ITES outsourcing market size, reaching $142 billion by 2008. If Bangladesh were to capture even a small share of this market, it would mean a significant number of jobs and export diversification for the country. As a provider of ITES for overseas customers, Bangladesh meets just the Basic Requirements in terms of telecommunications infrastructure, labor costs, and government policies. However, there is a great need to focus on creating or promoting Positive Factors within Bangladesh so that it could readily compete in the international arena. Other countries are already vying for their share by focusing on reduced costs, increased quality, and meaningful incentives for corporations to award their business to their locations instead of others. There are several segments of opportunities in which Bangladesh could compete; companies are already engaged in ITES for export in Data Conversion (Digitization), Geographic Information Systems and Software Development. Low labor costs and the supply of semi-skilled, production-oriented labor are key advantages. However, there are limiting factors that need to be addressed to increase the country's competitiveness  and it appears appropriate for the government to assume the lead in resolving these constraints. The high costs of telecommunications (on both absolute and comparative bases) clearly constrain the potential and profitability of companies in this sector which is critically dependent on information transfer. The small domestic market for IT related services also limits training and experience of local workers in order to gain expertise in higher value-added ITES. Lastly, there is the need to build overseas awareness of Bangladesh as a potential ITES provider. Along with promoting Positive Factors for the general business environment in the country, the government has the opportunity to initiate and/or lead the development of an ITES business development strategy for Bangladesh and Bangladeshi companies.  16  Anil Bajpai, ""Complete Bandwidth Management for Call Centres"", November 2001.  22  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  6 6.1  Exhibits Exhibit A: ITES Segments, as defined for this study Skills Required & Value-Added HIGH  Tier C Semi-Professional to Professional Management skills Expert knowledge DATA E-business consultancy Financial Accounting Network maintenance, management Systems Analysis, Integration Software design and development E-commerce development Testing, Implementation         Labor Educated in CS and/or MIS Knowledge of programming languages Project mgmt.

Traditional DP services comprise of punching data from manually filled forms, images or publications; preparing databases and integrating them. More recent developments in multimedia and the Internet has resulted in more diverse sources such as digital images, sounds and video, and managing records from internet-based queries. DP has become more important to corporations and organizations, as most businesses have become dependent on timely delivery and effective use of information. Industries and companies have to rely on data for quick decision-making in an increasingly informationdriven, globally competitive landscape. Outsourcing has become a critical aspect of companies' information strategy; in-house personnel are retained and required to use skills keenly focused on the enterprises' ""core competencies"", thereby releasing the lesser value-added services to outside vendors. How It W orks Clients for DP services are companies and organizations receiving or generating large quantities of forms in handwritten or typed format; these documents are usually time sensitive. Forms can be sent physically or can be scanned and transmitted to the vendor's facility.

The data is then processed or checked by validation routines that are customized for the client, including table look-ups,  Service ITES Segment Description, Definition  24  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  Service  Data Processing data/range checks, or relationship validation. Processed documents are then sent to verification stations for quality assurance, after which the data is transformed into the client's formatted record layout and transmitted to the client's computer. Further value can be added by vendors who could also provide data analysis  database searches, database integration, data mining and custom reports. Higher in this value chain is data warehousing and architecture, involving the design of how to optimize accessibility to and relationships among the data. There are also companies striving for ""end-to-end"" services where they provide complete back-office operations management including data maintenance and customer support.

The latter is a fast growing trend for publishing and corporate documentation. Benefits of digitization include: a) long term preservation of documents, b) orderly archiving of documents, c) easy and customized access to information, d) easy information dissemination through images and text, CD-ROMs, Internet, intranets and extranets. Some applications of digital technology include: books, research journals, annual reports, legacy documents, database archiving; movies, catalogs and brochures, training and educational manuals. A sub-category of data digitization is Geographic Information Systems (GIS); see the separate Segment Profile on GIS. How It W orks The process begins with identifying the client's objectives, needs and intended use of the digitized records. As with most client arrangements, it is recommended that written requirements, specifications, and agreement on final deliverables are completed with the client's final approval. The following general schema was obtained and revised from a digitization software provider along with data from STPI (see below): 1. Administration - Document Classes and Batch Management -define document classes, which specify both the index fields and the processing queues for each document. Scanning - Documents to be scanned are prepared by sorting into batches. As in any data entry production system, the batches are entered into the system, in this case by the scanner operator. Image Processing and Character Recognition -using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software, the documents are scanned by an operator -old and faded images are recovered using advanced digital correction software; sound and video data are treated similarly Index, Index Verify and Validation Scripts - data entry operators are presented with images for keying and verification; effective double-keying can be performed by routing the same documents sequentially to two  Service ITES Segment Description, Definition  2.  3.  4.  27  CA RAN A COR P ORAT I O N   External Market Analysis  Service  Data Digitization (also Data Conversion) operators. -validation scripts can be used to verify data formats, and to specify that certain fields must match; custom scripts can go much further, by filling in fields from an external database (indexing, tagging or mapping). 5. Quality Assurance and Rescan - the Quality Control operator sends defective batches are queued to the rescan workstation, with instructions regarding rejected document or page to describe the problem to the Rescan operator Release -after Quality Control and Indexing, the images and data are ""Released"" to the target application, which could include Microsoft SQL Server, Informix, Oracle, and Sybase. The digitized sources of information are then integrated on a CD-ROM or other media, depending on the client's intended use.

Concept drawings are done, which become bases for storyboards.  Background layout and finally the background art is completed. Costume, appearance, models and props are designed, while simultaneously a storyboard of angles, shots, dialogues and sound is prepared.  Animation is then coordinated between frames and background voice, etc. Motion Capture Optical motion capture involves tracing and capturing the movements of an object and feeding it to a system generated 3D model, thus animating it.

Film Conversion  Synchronization of sound and picture for both small and big screens  Video format conversion; Real-time movies to frames/ frames to real-time movies  Digitizing of sound; output in any medium, film, video or CD- Tapes used: Beta, digital beta and DAT. 2D Animation Involves drawing out every detail of an action into separate cell sheets, and then running them together at a very high speed so that an illusion of motion is created on screen.  creative team includes; traditional artists, key animators, background designers, ink and paint experts, computer professionals, design and model professionals, visualizers and compositors 3D Animation Involves three specific stages; modeling, texturing and animation.  Modeling  building the characters and sets that go into the movie.  Texturing  life-giving touches like color, texture etc. are added to the character model.  The last stage is animation, where movement is introduced into the model. Post-Production Comprises of scanning, non-linear editing and recording. Postproduction activities include ""Rotosplining"", ""Rotoscoping"", Compositing, Motion tracking, Camera stabilization, Image retouching, Film restoration, color corrections, morphing and warping. Robi Roncarelli, President, editor and publisher of PIXEL, the international magazine devoted to animation industry predicts:  $30 billion by year end 2001  by 2005 up to $70 billion  growing at a rate of 25% per year  Share of the global animation business: o North America, 46.9 % (down from 52% in 1996) o Asia-Pacific, 28% o Europe, 25.1% o The biggest gainers as vendors are Asian countries like the Philippines, Thailand, Korea and Japan. Outlook for outsourcing in this segment appears promising as Hollywood feature films include more animation and special effects, while cost-cutting has also become more of a concern.

However, as the developer continues to the latter stages of the production cycle  coding, testing, implementation/maintenance, and customization  high speed and large bandwidth subscriber lines are required. The infrastructure requirements become higher during these latter stages due to the transfer of code (either work-in-process or final product) to the overseas client or project team, when data packet loss should be minimized. There are varying levels of labor requirements for each software development stage: 1. Needs analysis, functional specification: Very high knowledge and technical expertise; plus managerial and conceptual skills 2. Design: Same as above 3. Coding (also known as programming): Qualified programmers, project managers, technical documentation 4. Testing: Basic computer skills provided specific instructions for testing 5. Implementation and maintenance: Same as Coding 6. Customization: Same as Coding, Implementation; but may also require subject matter expertise for customization (e.g. insurance, airline industry experience) Aside from qualifications in software development and relevant certifications:  Ability to understand customer's business processes to effectively design solutions  Project management  Quality assurance  On-time delivery Poor project management quoted as the #1 problem with outsourced development projects (Cutter Consortium, November 2000).

For instances where system failures are possible, agencies are     developing plans to assure continuity of their core business functions.     Completing and testing these plans will become increasingly important as we     approach the year 2000.                     Individually, nine of the 24 major Federal agencies, grouped into     Tier 3, are identified as continuing to make adequate progress on the year 2000     problem. Among these agencies, 74 percent of mission-critical systems are now     year 2000 compliant, and 89 percent of systems being repaired have now been     renovated.            At the same time, many agencies continue to face significant     challenges in their year 2000 efforts. Eight agencies are identified as making     progress, but with concerns (Tier 2), and seven are identified as not making     adequate progress (Tier 1). In this report, one agency, the State Department,     was downgraded to Tier 1. While increased high-level focus on the problem has     resulted in improvement at some of the most troubled agencies, their overall     progress must increase if they are to meet the Government-wide year 2000     milestones for completing their work by March 31, 1999.            To ensure that agencies are prioritizing their year 2000 efforts, on     June 19, 1998, OMB directed all agencies of concern (Tiers 1 and 2) to provide     to OMB their plans for monthly progress, and to subsequently provide to OMB, on     a monthly basis, a report which measures progress against those plans. In     addition, John Koskinen, Assistant to the President and Chair of the     President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, now attends monthly senior     management meetings of the Tier 1 Cabinet agencies about the year 2000 problem.                Moreover, based on the rankings of this report, Vice President Gore     on September 2 met with heads and senior officials of the Departments of     Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, State, and     Transportation, and of the U.S. Agency for International Development to review     their plans for prioritizing year 2000 efforts.            On cost, agencies now estimate they will spend $5.4 billion fixing     the problem in Federal systems -- up from $5 billion in May. This increase is     consistent with the President’s budget request, which anticipated that     additional requirements would emerge over the course of the year and included     an allocation to provide flexible funding to address emerging needs. In fact,     additional needs for one-time funding have been arising as anticipated. This     increase is due, in part, to the success of verification and validation efforts     which have enabled agencies to better ascertain the compliance of their     systems. In response to these needs, the Administration supports Congressional     action to create an emergency funding mechanism for Y2K computer conversion     requirements. This action is consistent with the President's budget.            A number of Government-wide efforts are underway to coordinate     progress in the areas of telecommunications, buildings systems, and bio-medical     devices and laboratory equipment. These efforts have encountered resistance     from some vendors, who, at times, are reluctant to provide the Federal     Government with information about the compliance of their products. The     Administration's proposed ""Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act"" would help to     eliminate many of the barriers to information sharing. In the areas of     Federal/State data exchanges, most Federal agencies have provided status     information, as have most States.                  Progress on Year 2000     Conversion  Report of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget  as     of August 15, 1998             I. INTRODUCTION             This report is the sixth in a series of quarterly summary reports to     Congress on the Administration's progress in fixing the year 2000 (""Y2K"")     computer problem in Federal systems. It outlines the continuing work to avert     the problems that could occur if systems are not able to correctly process the     year 2000. This summarizes data received from the 24 agencies that make up the     Federal Chief Information Officers' (CIO) Council and from nine small and     independent agencies. These data were due to OMB on August 15, 1998. 1/  It also describes the     status of government-wide activities underway. This report and all previous     reports are available on OMB's web site [ /OMB ], on     the web site for the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion [ http://www.y2k.gov ], or on the Federal Chief     Information Officers' web page [ http://cio.gov ]. 2/             OMB's initial Y2K report, entitled ""Getting Federal Computers Ready     for the Year 2000,"" was transmitted February 6, 1997. The report outlined the     Federal Government's strategy to address the Y2K problem in its systems, one     that remains predicated on agency accountability. The Government's approach     follows the five phases of awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and     implementation. Working with the CIO Council, OMB set government-wide     milestones for the completion of each phase.   Agencies then established     plans for each phase.   The five phases overlap -- for example, validation     of some systems begins while renovation of others continues.            The Administration has taken several significant steps during the     last quarter to spur progress on the problem within and beyond the Federal     Government. At a July 14 event on the Y2K problem, President Clinton and Vice     President Gore underscored the importance of preparing systems for the year     2000, not only within the Federal government, but in the private sector as     well. The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, which began operations     in March and is chaired by Assistant to the President John Koskinen, has     continued its efforts to increase awareness of the problem beyond the Federal     Government. Under the Council's direction, agencies are reaching out to private     sector organizations, State and local governments, and international     institutions in their policy areas and are participating on 35 Council working     groups to address year 2000 activities in key economic sectors. The working     groups are working closely with industry to facilitate and coordinate     information sharing on year 2000 progress and solutions. Their efforts are an     important part of the Council's ""National Campaign for Year 2000 Solutions,""     which was kicked-off at a July 28 event focused on the Y2K problem's     implications for the electric power industry.                1/  Except where     noted, the summary data provided in this report refer solely to the 24 agencies     on the CIO Council.                       2/  A list of key     Federal year 2000 web sites may be found on the last page of this report.                  The Administration also recognizes a critical need for industry to     share information about their year 2000 problems and solutions with each other     and with the public. Such sharing and cooperation is essential to making sure     that companies can avoid ""reinventing the wheel"" and can proceed with their     fixes in the most effective and timely way. Accordingly, the Administration has     proposed the ""Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act,"" which would encourage     companies to share information about possible solutions to year 2000 problems.            The Administration has taken significant actions in the last quarter     to ensure that agencies are focusing on compliance. On June 19, 1998, OMB     directed all agencies in Tier 1 (those where there is insufficient evidence of     adequate progress) and Tier 2 (those that have demonstrated progress, but still     are of concern) to provide to OMB plans for monthly progress, and to     subsequently provide to OMB, on a monthly basis, reports which measure actual     progress against those plans. In addition, John Koskinen is now attending the     monthly senior management meetings of Tier 1 agencies on the year 2000 problem     to work with them on their programs. And on September 2, the Vice President met     with heads and senior officials of Tier 1 Cabinet agencies, based on this     report -- the Departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human     Services, State, and Transportation, and the U.S. Agency for International     Development. He stressed the importance surmounting obstacles to year 2000     progress.                    II. SUMMARY OF GOVERNMENT-WIDE PROGRESS               This summary report shows that:               Only two agencies -- AID and HHS -- are working toward dates that     are beyond the Government-wide milestones or the completion of their Y2K work.     The government-wide milestones are completion of renovation by September 1998,     validation by January 1999, and implementation by March 1999. Some agencies --     Justice, Treasury, GSA, OPM, SBA, and SSA -- have set goals ahead of the     Government-wide milestones. (See Appendix A, Table 1.)                Senior Federal managers continue to reevaluate which systems are     truly critical to their organizations' missions and reset their priorities     accordingly. Agencies now identify 7,343 mission critical systems, which is     slightly more than the 7,336 identified in the May report. (See Appendix A,     Table 2.)                Of the 7,343 mission critical systems, 50 percent (3,692) are now     year 2000 compliant, compared to 40 percent in the previous report. This     includes systems repaired, replaced, and those that were already compliant.     (See Appendix A, Table 2.)                Of the 7,343 mission critical systems, 40 percent (2,910) are     still being repaired; 9 percent (650) are still being replaced; and 1 percent     (91) will be retired. (See Appendix A, Table 2.)                Of those systems that have been or will be repaired, 71 percent     have completed renovation, an increase from 55 percent in the previous report.     Forty-four percent have now completed validation, while implementation is now     37 percent complete. (See Appendix A, Table 3.)                Agencies now estimate they will spend $5.4 billion fixing the     problem from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2000, an increase from $5.0     billion in the previous report. 3/  (See Appendix A, Table 4.) This is     consistent with the President's budget, which anticipated that requirements     would emerge over the course of the year and included an allocation to provide     flexible funding to address emerging needs. In fact, as anticipated, additional     needs for one-time funding have been rising.                This increase in estimated cost is attributable to refinement of     estimates as agencies move through the phases of renovation and validation and     to the newly-found costs associated with fixing the embedded chip problem. To     the extent that agencies encounter unexpected difficulties, these estimates     will continue to rise. Moreover, as agencies work through the validation phase     and develop continuity of business plans, it is possible that some agencies     will determine that they require significant additional funding. Such funding     must be made available quickly in order to ensure that work proceeds without     interruption. The Administration supports Congressional action to create an     emergency funding provision for Y2K computer conversion requirements. This     action is consistent with the President's budget.                Most agencies report that they have completed their assessments     of non-mission critical systems. By definition, such systems are less critical     to the functioning of the agencies, but many are still important. All of the     agencies reported they have an active program to fix these systems, albeit as a     lower priority.                 Most agencies report that they have taken steps to assess     embedded chip problems. This area is of increasing concern.                         3/  These estimates     include the costs of identifying necessary changes, evaluating the cost     effectiveness of making those changes (fix or scrap decisions), making changes,     testing systems, and preparing contingencies for failure recovery. They include     the costs for fixing both mission critical and non-mission critical systems, as     well non-information technology products and systems such as air conditioning     and heating. They do not include the costs of upgrades or replacements that     would otherwise occur as part of the normal systems life cycle. They also do     not include the Federal share of the costs for state information systems that     support Federal programs.                       The Federal Government continues to make progress in addressing the     year 2000 problem. However, the overall rate of progress for some agencies is     still not fast enough. OMB has categorized agencies into one of three tiers.     Tier 1 comprises agencies where there is insufficient evidence of adequate     progress. For agencies in Tier 2, OMB sees evidence of progress, but also has     concerns. The remaining agencies in Tier 3 are making satisfactory progress.            Although 74 percent of Tier 3 agency systems are compliant, only 42     percent of Tier 1 agency are compliant. The following table provides detail on     the progress of the agencies by tier.           Table 1  Government-wide Summary --     Year 2000 Status  Mission-Critical Systems                                 Agency Status        All Systems        Systems Being Repaired                      Y2K Compliant  4/        Renovation Complete  5/        Implementation Complete  6/                      Tier Three  (VA, EPA, FEMA, GSA, NASA, NRC, NSF, SBA,       SSA)        74%        89%        70%                      Tier Two  (USDA, DOC, HUD, DOI, DOL, DOJ, Treasury,       OPM)        56%        72%        42%                      Tier One  (DoD, Education, DOE, HHS, State,       Transportation, AID)        42%        66%        24%                      All Agencies        50%        71%        37%                               4/  Percentage of all     mission-critical systems that will accurately process data through the century     change; these systems have been tested and are operational and includes systems     that have been repaired and replaced, as well as those that were found to be     already compliant.                5/  Percentage of     mission-critical systems that have been or are being repaired; ""Renovation     complete"" means that necessary changes to a system's databases and/or software     have been made.                6/  Percentage of     mission-critical systems that are being or have been repaired; ""Implementation     Complete"" means that the system has been tested for compliance and has been     integrated into the system environment where the agency performs its routine     information processing activities. For more information on definitions, see     GAO/AIMD-10.1.14, ""Year 2000 Computing Crisis: An Assessment Guide,"" September     1997, available at  http://cio.gov  under Year     2000 Documents.                     During the last quarter, the Administration took several steps to     focus management attention and resources to this problem in order to ensure     that solving the year 2000 problem is the agencies' top management priority. As     mentioned previously, John Koskinen attending the monthly senior management     meetings of the Tier 1 Cabinet agencies on the year 2000 problem to engage in     discussions of ways to evaluate and prioritize work. In addition, to better     focus management attention on plans and progress, all agencies that were rated     as Tier 1 or Tier 2 were requested to provide to OMB their plans for meeting     their renovation, validation, and implementation goals with monthly benchmarks.     These agencies are now reporting monthly on their progress against those     benchmarks. These plans and progress reports are a factor in OMB's evaluation     of agency-specific progress as outlined in section IV.            Finally, agencies are required to report on any mission-critical     systems for which year 2000 renovation or replacements have fallen more than     two months behind schedule. Agencies are also required to report on any system     that will not meet the March 1999 target for completion of implementation.     These agency exception reports are summarized in Appendix B.            A significant number of these plans show agencies completing work on     a large number of systems in the month just before their target dates --     usually March 1999. This is troubling, as information technology projects in     general are prone to unanticipated complications and delays. In response to     this end-loading of work in plans, some agencies have taken strong and     aggressive management action to make sure that their goals are met. For     example, the Secretary of Defense, on August 7, 1998, directed detailed reviews     and reports of the status of year 2000 implementation by each of the Unified     Commanders-in-Chief and warned that, as of October 1, IT funding for the owners     of some systems may be withheld if there is not sufficient evidence of     progress.                    III. GOVERNMENT-WIDE ISSUES             VERIFICATION EFFORTS              Independent verification assists senior management by providing a     double-check that their mission-critical systems will, in fact, be ready. All     large agencies have independent verification programs underway for that reason.     These activities are paying off, as agencies have realized that some systems,     which were considered compliant, were not. This process allows management     sufficient time to take action.            It is essential that accurate information be reported to senior     management in a timely manner, so that they can take appropriate action. Agency     Inspectors General have been helpful to senior management in this regard as     well. They are, for example, taking an active role in verifying the accuracy of     reports to senior agency management and reports to OMB and the Congress.          CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND CONTINUITY OF     BUSINESS PLANNING             In the reports this quarter, agencies have provided more detailed     information on contingency planning for those systems that are expected to miss     the March 1999 deadline for implementation. (See Appendix 5.) In addition,     although most agencies provided some information on the steps they are taking     to develop continuity of business plans, a great deal of work remains to be     done. These plans should describe risk mitigation strategies and work-around     alternatives to ensure the continuity of the agency's core business functions.     Such functions rely not only on the agency's internal systems, but also on     services outside of the agency's control, such as the ability of suppliers to     provide products, services, or data, or the loss of critical infrastructure.     This work remains in its early stages, but, given its importance, will be     addressed by agencies in coming months.            To support agencies in these efforts, the Year 2000 Committee of the     CIO Council worked with GAO to develop guidance on continuity of business     planning. 7/  The Business     Continuity and Contingency Plan of the Social Security Administration was     shared with other agencies as a model. In addition, on July 22, 1998, OMB     issued ""Revised Reporting Requirements for Year 2000 Efforts"" (M-98-12), which     asked for additional information on contingency planning and continuity of     business planning.          FUNDING              The President's budget anticipated that additional requirements would     emerge over the course of the year and included an allocation to provide     flexible funding to address emerging needs. In fact, additional needs for     one-time funding have been rising as anticipated.            In response to these additional needs, on August 13, 1998, OMB asked     agencies to provide to OMB their comprehensive plans and associated funding     requirements for achieving year 2000 compliance. This information will augment     the quarterly reports to OMB and will be used to assess the possible need for     additional funding for each agency.            The Administration supports Congressional action to create an     emergency fund mechanism for Y2K computer conversion requirements. This action     is consistent with the President's budget. If approved by the Congress, such a     fund could make up to $3.25 billion available to the agencies, to be used     exclusively for the direct costs of addressing the year 2000 problem. The     availability of these funds would be contingent upon the President's     certification that these are, in fact, emergency requirements. These funds     would be available to cover the unanticipated costs of agency year 2000 efforts     for all types of information technology, including computer software and     hardware, telecommunications systems and their components, and other systems     and components (such as building security systems and medical devices) that     contain or depend on embedded microchips. OMB expects that such funding will be     particularly important for problems uncovered as a result of verification and     validation efforts and for contingency planning and continuity of business     planning.                7/  GAO report,     ""Year 2000 Computing Crisis: Business Continuity and Contingency Planning.""     July, 1998; GAO/AIMD-10.1.19.                     GOVERNMENT-WIDE INITIATIVES              The Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council Committee on the Year     2000 has a established Subcommittees on Telecommunications, on Buildings, and     on Biomedical Devices and Laboratory Equipment, to work on government-wide     areas where the Y2K problem occurs outside of computer systems. In these areas,     the problem occurs in commercial products that rely on computers or have     computer chips inside them; the problem needs to be fixed by manufacturers of     those products. The Committee has also established a subcommittee on State     Issues that is focusing on ensuring that exchanges of data between the Federal     government and the States will not be interrupted.            Information sharing among vendors, manufacturers, service providers,     and customers -- in this case, Federal agencies -- about year 2000 problems and     solutions is critical. Despite intense efforts on the part of the Federal     Government, many vendors, manufacturers, and service providers are reluctant to     share information. In most cases, they fear that such information will be used     as the basis for a liability lawsuit later -- despite the fact that failure to     share information increases the probability that their products will not be     ready in time. In response, the Administration has proposed the ""Year 2000     Information Disclosure Act,"" which would encourage companies to share     information about possible solutions to year 2000 problems.              Telecommunications     Systems             Like the private sector, the Federal agencies are reliant upon     commercial vendors and the information they supply to address the compliance of     their telecommunications systems. GSA owns, manages, or resells consolidated     telecommunications services to Federal agencies throughout the United States.     In most cases, agencies must work with telecommunications vendors to receive     system upgrades; a number of agencies have expressed frustration that some     vendors have been slow to either provide information about the status of their     products or to repair the system.            The Telecommunications Subcommittee, chaired by GSA's Federal     Technology Service (FTS), is working with industry to ensure that the     telecommunications services and systems provided to the Federal Government are     year 2000 compliant. FTS has completed its inventory and assessment for all GSA     Consolidated Systems, which provide local telecommunications services     (including hardware, licensed proprietary software, and features such as voice     mail) to Federal agencies nationwide.            Through special interest groups for testing telecommunications     equipment, the Subcommittee has established a government-wide database with     information about compliant and non-compliant telecommunications products. This     database is available for vendors to post the status of their products at      http://y2k.fts.gsa.gov . The site also     provides links to the Web sites of more than 50 vendors.            The Federal Government will participate in network interoperability     testing of certain critical systems scheduled by industry for early 1999. Thus     far, testing has shown that 90 percent of the PBXs owned by GSA are already     compliant. For the remaining 10 percent, manufacturers have indicated that they     will provide upgrade solutions. With respect to service obtained from Local     Exchange Carriers (LECs), GSA is contacting LEC service providers for     information on their year 2000 status which it is then providing to other     Federal agency users.            In the Washington Metropolitan Area, the Washington Interagency     Telecommunications Systems (WITS) provides approximately 170,000 analog and     digital lines supporting both data and voice applications to Federal agencies.     The system was fixed in July 1998.         FTS 2000               Through the Government's FTS 2000 contract, GSA is responsible for     ensuring year 2000 compliance for all Federal Government long distance     telecommunications. GSA intends to transition to FTS2001 contracts where     possible before the onset of the year 2000 to ensure compliance and a smooth     transition. In the event that the transition to FTS2001 has not been completed     by January 1, 2000, GSA has a contingency plan to use Sprint and AT&T     FTS2000 services. Both companies have made formal commitments that their     systems will be year 2000 compliant prior to the year 2000.         International Telecommunications               Within the United States, the International Direct Distance Dialing     contract with AT&T that is managed by FTS has been certified compliant.     Overseas, however, Federal agencies that have extensive foreign operations are     reviewing the effect that the year 2000 may have on their ability to     communicate with their overseas offices, which depend on the telecommunications     infrastructures of other countries. The State Department has determined that     more than 90 percent of the telecommunications equipment it operates overseas     is compliant or can be operated in a manual mode. Roughly 5 percent of its     telecommunications services are supported by equipment that is operated by the     host nation. Several agencies, including the Peace Corps and the Agency for     International Development, have expressed concern that overseas operations in     some countries may be adversely affected by host nation telecommunications     problems. In these instances, international agencies are working together to     develop contingency plans or to identify backup systems, such as satellites, to     ensure communications are maintained.         Other Government-wide Telecommunications Services               The equipment supplied by the Federal Wireless Telecommunications     Service (FWTS) has been certified compliant by GTE. Contracts for the Wire and     Cable Service; Electronic Commerce, Internet, and E-Mail Access; and Technical     and Management Support contain year 2000 compliance clauses. All task orders     for the Telecommunications Support Contract 2, which provides consulting and     telecommunications services, include year 2000 compliance clauses.              Buildings Systems              Many products or systems in buildings, such as security systems,     elevators, or heating and air conditioning systems, contain embedded chips.     Frequently, these chips include a date function that helps run the system --     for example, to time maintenance procedures or to regulate temperature. If this     date function is not year 2000 compliant, then the chip may not work. This     problem is particularly complex, because chip manufacturers do not closely     track how these chips are used. In addition, a manufacturer of equipment (such     as a security system) is unlikely to know the status of the chips it is using.     It may also be difficult to accurately test the compliance of these chips in a     working environment. Once non-compliant chips are identified, they must be     replaced. This otherwise simple task of replacement is complicated by the large     numbers of such chips and the lack of complete information about where they are     located.            In response, GSA is contacting the vendors and manufacturers of all     equipment in all GSA-owned or GSA-managed buildings to determine the compliance     or non-compliance of equipment and to determine any necessary remedial action.     Based on this outreach, elevators, once thought to be highly susceptible, are     no longer considered to be a concern. On the other hand, security/access     systems are now coming under closer scrutiny.            In addition, GSA has established a website ( http://globe.lmi.org/lmi_pbs/y2kproducts/ )     that provides year 2000 information for building systems products. While there     are now over 9,000 products listed on this site (up from 6,000 in the previous     report), less than 5 percent of all products are identified as non-compliant.     Another website has been established which allows personnel from Federal     agencies to determine the year 2000 compliance status of Federally owned and     leased facilities. This site is for Federal Government use only.         GSA Owned or Managed Buildings               To ensure that Federal buildings are ready for the year 2000, the CIO     Council established the Building Systems Subcommittee, which is chaired by     GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). Their charge is to ensure that any     equipment that contains embedded chips in GSA- owned or GSA-managed buildings     is year 2000 compliant. In space where GSA is the owner, PBS continues to     thoroughly review inventory and coordinate with vendors and manufacturers of     equipment that contains embedded chips. Approximately 75 percent of the GSA     building inventory has been surveyed to identify equipment considered     susceptible to year 2000 issues.         GSA Leased Buildings               GSA is also working closely with the owners of buildings that are     leased by GSA. For leased space, GSA sent letters that describe potential     problems associated with building systems containing embedded microchips and     requesting that lessors certify their space as year 2000 compliant. About 40     percent responded. GSA will send follow-up letters to non-responsive lessors     and will forward brief surveys for ""high-risk"" leased locations within 60 days.     Through a contractor, GSA is developing compliance reports for each building in     order to provide building managers with the basis for developing remedial     action plans. Finally, a year 2000 clause was developed for inclusion in all     Solicitations For Offers for all new leased space.         Other Federal Government Buildings               The Subcommittee also holds monthly meetings with representatives     from 45 Federal agencies and bureaus in order to disseminate information to     tenant agencies as well as share information with agencies that own or manage     their own buildings.         Contingency Planning for Buildings               GSA has also established a Business Continuity and Contingency     Planning (BCCP) Task Force. This interagency task force is developing a model     BCCP for buildings for use by Federal agencies. The BCCP will be organized     around core business processes. The BCCP will also be made available to the     public.       Biomedical Devices and     Laboratory Equipment             Biomedical devices and laboratory equipment often rely on computer     chips to help provide timing and maintenance functions. Although the effects on     many devices are not serious, for others, they may result in equipment failure.     Such failure will put patients at risk. Federal agencies and private sector     users of biomedical devices and laboratory equipment need to know which     equipment is susceptible to failure and must take corrective action.            To provide better information on the status of biomedical devices and     laboratory equipment to the Federal agencies that own and use such devices, the     CIO Council Year 2000 Committee established the Biomedical Equipment     Subcommittee, chaired by the Department of Health and Human Services. On     January 21, 1998, the Deputy Secretary of the Department sent a letter to over     14,000 manufacturers of biomedical devices and laboratory equipment, asking     them to verify the compliance of their products. On June 29, the FDA sent a     follow-up letter to 1,935 manufacturers whose products were likely to contain     electronic components. To date, only a little over 10 percent of manufacturers     have responded to the initial inquiry and to follow-up inquiries.            This information has been made publicly available to health care     providers, facilities, and consumers on a web site located at      http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/yr2000/html .     The web site contains information about products that still need to be made     year 2000 compliant, as well as solutions that the manufacturer will offer to     mitigate the problem (e.g., software updates), and the date on which a     compliant product will be available.            Ultimately, the responsibility for informing the public about the     compliance of products lies with manufacturers. It is critical that     manufacturers provide information about the compliance of their products in     order to prevent year 2000 date problems in biomedical equipment from     endangering the nation's patient care and health research activities.     Accordingly, the Federal Government is considering taking action to prohibit     the acquisition of biomedical equipment from any manufacturer if the     manufacturer has not informed the Federal Government of the year 2000     compliance for all of its products.       State Issues             Federal agencies exchange data with each other; with foreign, State,     and local governments; and with private entities. Because States operate many     vital Federal programs, such as unemployment insurance and Medicaid, these     exchanges are extremely important. (Although the Federal Government exchanges     very little data with local governments, it remains concerned about progress     there.) The Subcommittee on State Issues of the CIO Council's Year 2000     Committee is working with the National Association of State Information     Resource Executives to focus on the exchanges between the Federal Government     and State governments. All Federal agencies have inventoried their data     exchanges and have discussed both the format of the exchanges and the timing of     making fixes to them with their data exchange partners.            On behalf of the CIO Council, GSA has established a secure web site     for use by the Federal agencies and the States, and in July, all parties began     to post the status of their data exchanges on the web.  8/  The status of each data exchange is     shown as one of five categories: (1) compliant and successfully tested by both     parties; (2) successfully bridged with both parties concurring in the format;     (3) Federal side ready but not yet tested; (4) State ready but not yet tested;     and (5) not yet compliant or testing still in progress. This information is     being updated by both parties on a monthly basis.            At this point, the database is being set up and both sides are making     sure that data are accurate. Most Federal agencies have posted the status of     their data exchanges. Some agencies have requested that their data exchanges     not be posted for security reasons. In these cases, the information has been     sent to NASIRE for distribution to State CIOs. Over half of the States have     verified the data posted by the Federal agencies. As more status information is     posted, standard reports will be distributed to Federal agencies and States     which will provide an up-to-date view of data exchanges.                8/  Access to the     site is limited to authorized personnel from the Federal agencies and State     governments.                  Other Information Sharing     Initiatives         Year 2000 Information Directory              GSA also manages and maintains the Governmentwide Year 2000     Information Directory web site on behalf of the CIO Council. The directory     provides one-stop access to information, solutions, and Internet sites dealing     with the year 2000 problem. It acts as a clearinghouse for information for     Federal, State and local governments, as well as for private industry and the     public. This web site [ http://www.itpolicy.gsa.gov/mks/yr2000/y2khome.htm ]     was selected for inclusion in  The Dow Jones Business Directory . The web     site includes articles and information on year 2000 product compliance,     contingency planning, and health care and industry concerns, as well as a guide     on the legal issues surrounding procurement and contracts. The site also     includes links to sites with information on telecommunications,     commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, facilities, and biomedical equipment.            Database of Compliant COTS Products              On behalf of the CIO Council, the Office of Governmentwide Policy at     GSA also maintains a directory of compliant, COTS Products that are used by     Federal agencies. This information is also available to the public. [ http://y2k.policyworks.gov ] Information     contained in the database is based on vendor assertions about their products     and agency statements about their experiences with particular COTS products.                    IV. AGENCY SPECIFIC PROGRESS             PROCESS OF AGENCY EVALUATION              Virtually all of the agencies have made progress in the last quarter,     although in many cases there are serious concerns about the rate of that     progress. To evaluate agency progress, OMB used four criteria:              Measurable improvement  -- Is there measurable and adequate     progress on renovation, validation, and implementation of computer systems,     including data exchanges? Is there progress on addressing other systems,     including buildings, telecommunications, and systems and products containing     embedded chips?                Schedule for completion of best practices phases and overall     prognosis  -- Has the agency adopted a realistic schedule that is consistent     with the government-wide goals? Has there been a change in the number of     mission-critical systems that are expected to miss the March 1999     implementation date? Does the agency have a strong management team and a     credible strategy in place?                Risk management  -- Is the agency preparing a workable     continuity of business plan for its core business functions? Does the agency     have a deadline for when plans must be complete? Does the agency have an     effective and independent validation and verification program in place? Is     there adequate oversight of efforts to replace non-compliant systems? Are     systems previously reported behind being brought back on schedule?                Dramatic changes in previously reported information or other     indications of concern  -- Have there been dramatic changes in cost,     schedule, changes to the number of systems, or changes to the number of systems     behind schedule? Are there any concerns with the availability of key personnel?                       TIER ONE AGENCIES              Tier One comprises agencies where there is insufficient evidence of     adequate progress. The six agencies in the first tier are:         Department of Defense               The Department of Defense has a massive year 2000 challenge which     must be accomplished on a tight schedule. The Department has improved its rate     of progress in addressing the challenge, but the pace must be increased to meet     government-wide milestones. The percentage of mission critical systems that are     now compliant has risen to 42 percent, up from 29 percent in May. Additionally,     the percentage of mission-critical systems being repaired that have completed     renovation stands at 70 percent, up from 58 percent, and the percentage of     those systems that have been implemented has risen to 27 percent from 17     percent. On August 7, the Secretary ordered greater effort by the Unified     Commanders-in-Chief, inaugurated operational evaluations of the affects of the     year 2000, and created an expanded management team to address this critical     national defense issue.         Department of Education               The Department of Education has made significant progress in the past     quarter. Of the Department's eight mission-critical systems, renovation went     from zero to four. However, rate of repair on the remaining systems is cause     for concern. Renovation of the Pell Recipients Financial Management System is     expected in December 1998, five months later than scheduled. Renovation of ED's     Local Area Network is expected in November 1998, two months late. Two other     systems are scheduled to be renovated by September 1998, but will require close     monitoring to meet their tight deadline. In addition, four of the six systems     that are in the validation stage have completed testing for year 2000     compliance, but will be re-tested -- prior to certification as compliant --     once recent programmatic changes have been incorporated.            The Department has made significant progress the systems it calls     ""mission-important"" and ""mission-supportive."" Of the 168 systems in these     categories, Education has completed all work on 130 systems, (84 of which were     completed during the most recent quarter). The Department is aggressively     validating data exchanges and it continues to communicate year 2000 information     to the entire education community through its outreach efforts.         Department of Energy               Compliance has increased from 36 percent to 40 percent in the last     quarter, and modest progress has been made in the other phases. However, the     Department has not identified all mission-critical systems at its Government     and contractor sites, and assessment of the Department's embedded chips and lab     equipment continues. Although DOE has defined 411 systems as mission critical,     explicit departmental prioritization and allocation of resources among those     systems has not occurred. The Department's independent Office of Oversight     Review has recommended that DOE ""focus management attention on complex,     critical systems that face moderate to significant risk.""            All State and local government data exchanges with the Department are     reported compliant. Intra-departmental data exchanges are 63 percent compliant,     data exchanges with other Federal agencies are 56 percent compliant, and data     exchanges with private organizations are 43 percent compliant. The Department's     Acting CIO is conducting site compliance reviews in cooperation with the Office     of the Inspector General and Office of Oversight, but no independent     verification and validation contractors are being used for compliance reviews.         Department of Health and Human Services               The Department's Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) remains     a serious concern as a result of its internal and external systems remediation     schedule and escalating cost estimates. As of this report, only 56 percent of     HCFA's internal systems and 14 percent of external contractor systems have been     renovated. While HCFA's remediation schedule indicates that most systems will     be renovated and implemented by the HHS deadline of December 31, 1998, it is     likely that some internal and many external systems will fail to meet that     date. Furthermore, OMB is concerned that at least some Medicare contractors may     fail to meet the March 1999 government-wide deadline for completing     implementation. Achievement of the HHS and government-wide milestones will     require an extraordinary acceleration of the remediation process in the last     three months of 1998, leaving very little margin for error to deal with     unforeseen and unanticipated problems. Finally, HCFA's cost estimates for Y2K     remediation have increased dramatically since the last quarterly report.            HCFA is attempting to address these concerns. It has delayed non-Y2K     systems work, such as standard system transitions and implementation of certain     statutory provisions, to increase the resources available for Y2K. HCFA has     also negotiated a contract amendment with its fiscal intermediaries and     carriers that makes Y2K compliance a performance measure. In addition, HCFA has     increased its Y2K staff by hiring retired Federal employees with Medicare     systems experience, and is informing physicians and other health care providers     of the importance of ensuring their systems are Y2K compliant.            HCFA has also begun developing contingency plans in case some     mission-critical systems fail in 2000. HCFA's lack of contracting flexibility,     which limits its ability to competitively contract for claims processing     activities, may negatively affect contingency planning. The Administration     urges Congress to pass contracting reform legislation, transmitted to Congress     on May 19, 1998, as soon as possible to ensure that HCFA is able to contract     with any qualified entity to ensure the continued operation of the Medicare     program in the case of a claims processing system failure.            Other HHS operating divisions have made some progress this quarter.     However, although all but one mission-critical system are projected to be     implemented by the government-wide deadline of March 1999, only 62 percent of     non-HCFA mission-critical systems are compliant. With respect to embedded     chips, facilities, and telecommunications, the relatively late start in     assessing costs in this area has produced a significant increase in estimated     costs. Increased emphasis on verification has also added to costs -- but     generally all operating divisions are doing a good job of incorporating     independent validation and verification into their schedules appropriately.     Virtually all critical systems will be subject to independent verification.     Non-HCFA operating divisions have also begun serious programs for contingency     and continuity of business planning and for outreach.         Department of State               The Department of State faces a significant challenge in managing its     extensive Y2K project while, at the same time, completely replacing information     systems installed at over 230 locations around the world as part of the ALMA (A     Logical Modernization Approach) program. Additionally, State is the major     provider of telecommunications services to U.S. Government agencies operating     overseas. State has done an impressive assessment of its Y2K situation,     particularly its embedded systems, and is asserting a leadership role in     providing Y2K support to U.S. operations overseas. The Department has assembled     a strong program management capability and successfully raised awareness of the     problem among the Foreign Service and U.S. Diplomatic communities.            Although State is making progress in replacing and modernizing its     information and telecommunications infrastructure, progress on renovation,     verification and implementation of mission-critical systems is of increasing     concern. In the last quarter, State did not report adequate progress on     completion of systems it is renovating, nor did it report adequate progress on     final validation of systems. The Department also must accelerate progress on     replacing 26 mission-critical applications if it is to meet the March 1999     government-wide milestone for completing implementation.            It should be noted that State's ALMA deployment includes several     mission-critical applications that the Department will not take credit for     having completed implementation until ALMA installation is completed worldwide     in April 1999. Deployment of ALMA is proceeding at about 90 percent of State's     deployment plan, which could further affect the ability of several smaller     posts to operate in 2000. State has begun contingency planning to ensure that     operations at these locations are not adversely affected.         Department of Transportation               The Department of Transportation's improved management oversight,     combined with an accelerating rate at which the Federal Aviation Administration     (FAA) is remediating air traffic control system components, is significantly     mitigating risk. At the end of July 1998, the Department-wide percentage of     mission-critical systems renovated stood at 65 percent, a significant     improvement over the 25 percent reported in the previous quarter. However, with     only 23 percent of its mission-critical systems validated and 11 percent     implemented, the Department continues to lag well behind the government-wide     schedule.            The FAA reflects this improved trend with 59 percent of     mission-critical systems renovated, up from 11 percent reported in May.     However, with 10 percent of its systems validated and 3 percent implemented, it     remains significantly behind schedule. The FAA has taken decisive action     concerning the HOST computer system and other critical air traffic control     systems. It has initiated procurement of new HOST computers while     simultaneously verifying, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the     existing HOST microcode is free of year 2000 vulnerabilities which would affect     the operational processing of flight and radar data. In addition, an ongoing     date roll-back test has been very promising and serves as a contingency plan     should replacement efforts be delayed and should HOST experience unexpected     year 2000 problems.            Notwithstanding this improvement, more needs to be done in three     areas. First, more work is needed concerning system interfaces. A number of     systems that were reported as fully renovated have not had their system     interfaces completely evaluated. At a minimum, individual system interfaces     need to be tested and validated before end-to-end system testing can be     successfully completed. Second, the year 2000 compliance status of a number of     systems that are under development is uncertain. The FAA needs to work with the     contractors and modify contracts, if necessary, to have a reasonable assurance     of compliance prior to the testing phase. Finally, the FAA needs to reevaluate     its master schedule and make a concerted effort to accelerate its     implementation schedule for all systems to March 1999, or as soon thereafter as     possible.            The U.S. Coast Guard's improved management and operational attention     to year 2000 issues has also minimized risk. While still facing challenges     associated with antiquated hardware and software on some critical systems, the     Coast Guard is presently well positioned to ensure continuity of its     safety-related systems. The Department's other operating administrations seem     to be on track to a smooth millennial transition.         U.S. Agency for International Development               AID again reported no progress in terms of the total number of     systems renovated, validated, or implemented. While AID has made a number of     management improvements, including plans to increase independent validation and     verification of contractor deliverables and increasing agency-wide Y2K     awareness, they are not expected to make measurable progress in renovating or     replacing any of their mission-critical systems until the end of August 1998.     Renovation of AID's most important system, the New Management System, has     begun. With contractor assistance, AID is evaluating options to reprogram     resources to accelerate progress.            AID has selected three vendors to replace desktop hardware and     software and intends to award a contract for Independent Verification and     Validation services for all mission-critical applications this September. AID     has begun continuity of business planning in August, identifying critical     functions that must be supported and assessing the need for related contingency     plans. The agency has assumed a leadership role in performing year 2000     outreach and awareness training in the over 80 nations in which it operates,     providing management assistance to host nations and other international aid     organizations operating in these countries.          TIER TWO AGENCIES              For agencies in Tier 2 the second tier, OMB sees evidence of     progress, but also has concerns. Some of these agencies have strong Y2K     programs and OMB expects them to continue to improve. The eight agencies in     Tier 2 are: the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, Housing and Urban     Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, and Treasury, and the Office of     Personnel Management. A summary of progress and concerns for these agencies     appears below.             Table 2        Tier 2 Agencies -- Progress, But Concerns                      Agency        Progress        Concerns                      USDA        Management team active. Guidance on       business continuity and contingency planning and independent validation and       verification has been finalized.        Pace of work must increase if       government-wide goals are to be met, particularly with the Forest Service.       Embedded systems, facilities, and telecommunications issues are not yet       resolved.                       DOC        Overall, making progress. The new       CIO is providing leadership on the Y2K issue; undertaking IV&V and       contingency planning; anticipates completing renovation phase for all but one       mission-critical system by September and implementation by March, 1999. PTO has       prepared a contingency plan for the Classified Search and Image Retrieval       System.         Lags behind government-wide goals.       NOAA must accelerate implementation of IV&V for mission-critical systems.                             HUD        Good progress in renovating       mission-critical systems and non-mission critical systems. Inspector General is       auditing Year 2000 Program and HUD has retained an independent validation and       verification contractor. Completed continuity of business plan and is preparing       contingency plans.        HUD must increase and sustain its       rate of progress if it is to meet the March 1999 goals. HUD has 84,000 data       exchange partners using 34 systems that must be resolved. Reported a $12.2       million (26 percent) increase in total year 2000-related costs.                      DOI        Project management continues to be       refined. Good progress on embedded chip, telecommunications, and data exchange       issues. Independent validation and verification efforts have been formally       established.        Pace of renovation, validation, and       implementation must improve if Department and government-wide goals are to be       met.                       DOJ        Good renovation progress. Justice       has assessed most of its embedded systems, and is making good progress in       assessing and upgrading its non-wireless telecommuni-cations systems. Office of       the Inspector General actively reviewing bureau status. Independent       verification and validation contractor is reviewing test plans and improving       compliance verification. Continuity of business and continency plans are being       developed.        Pace must improve if Department and       government-wide goals are to be met. DOJ has also identified $27 million in new       costs, almost doubling its previous estimate. An extensive number of data       exchanges must be verified as year 2000 compliant.                       DOL        Good progress on data exchanges,       especially with State unemployment systems; good progress against internal       schedule; anticipates completing the renovation phase for all but one system by       September and implementation for all systems by March 1999. The Department has       completed the assessment of embedded chips.        Despite some progress, still well       behind government-wide goals for agency mission-critical systems. Two large,       critical systems at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and  the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration will miss the       September renovation goal.                       Treasury        Strong project team in place. Good       progress on embedded chip, telecommunications, contingency planning, and data       exchange issues.         Rate of renovation, validation, and       implementation must improve if the Department and government wide goals are to       be met -- particularly for IRS, Customs, and FMS.                      OPM        Continued senior management       involvement is resulting in progress according to OPM's schedule. Expect       significant accomplishments in next quarter. Contingency planning       underway.        Rate of renovation, validation and       implementation of mission critical systems repairs must increase to meet       government-wide goals.                         TIER THREE AGENCIES              The remaining agencies are in Tier 3 and appear to be making     satisfactory progress. These nine agencies are the Environmental Protection     Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the National     Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Social Security Administration, the     General Services Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Nuclear     Regulatory Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of     Veterans Affairs.          SMALL AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES              Based on the results of a request for reports from 41 small and     independent agencies, OMB asked nine agencies to report again on their     progress, because of the importance of these agencies' missions, because of     concerns about the rate of progress, or because their initial reports did not     provide sufficient detail. Those agencies are: the Federal Communications     Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the National Archives and     Records Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the Office of     Administration in the Executive Office of the resident, the Peace Corps, the     Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Office of the U.S.     Trade Representative. John Koskinen will meet with selected small and     independent agencies in the next quarter. OMB will continue to work with all     small and independent agencies, as appropriate, to ensure that they are     prepared for the year 2000. OMB is asking all small and independent agencies to     report again on May 15, 1999.

Work started on 16 mission-critical systems. Will obtain IV&V contractor.       IG involved. Leading outreach efforts to telecommunications       industry.        Rate of progress must be       accelerated, particularly in replacement systems. Move to new headquarters       building addresses embedded systems, but complicates year 2000 work.

Progress       continues on renovation, validation, and implementation.        IV&V process has not been       formalized. Contingency planning needs strengthening.                                 National Archives and Records Administration                 22                 10                 5.7        Assessment will be complete by       September 30, 1998. Ten of its 22 mission-critical systems are now       compliant.        Seven of 22 mission critical       systems will miss the March 1999 implementation goal. Contingency planning has       not begun. Security and environmental control systems at Presidential Libraries       are a significant challenge.

When it became clear the Case Tracking System (CATS) designed to replace seven       existing systems would not be implemented in time, a contingency plan was       adopted to renovate existing systems.        Two mission-critical systems will       miss the March 1999 goal, including one which is a contingent system for CATS.       No plans for independent verification. No continuity of business plan.

Renovation of all mission-critical systems should complete by September       1998. Good contingency and continuity planning process.         Needs to accelerate validation and       implementation. Renovated financial management system will not be ready for       testing until May 1999. Dependent on foreign banks for disbursement. Need a       formal and independent verification capability.

The USPS year       2000 initiative is receiving considerable executive management       attention.        USPS has a massive challenge, given       its size and potential role in the contingency plans of many other       organizations, including Federal agencies.

Mission-critical systems are standard COTS office       support packages or simple databases that have been renovated and are being       tested. Systems in Geneva will be compliant in September.         Need to complete inventory, repair       and verification of data exchanges. Embedded systems, while minimal, should be       identified and assessed. Impending award of task order for IV&V services       should be accelerated if possible.                               9/  Represents only     FY1998 and 1999 costs.

programs. For example, the Agriculture total does     not include the potential 50 percent in Federal matching funds provided to     States by Food and Consumer Services to correct their year 2000 problems.     Similarly, the HHS total does not include the Medicaid baseline costs for the     Federal share of State systems. And, while Labor's FY 1998 appropriation     includes $200 million for States to correct year 2000 problems in State     unemployment insurance systems, that amount is not included in this estimate.                    12/  The FY 1999     cost estimate does not include $4.4 million planned for outreach to the     education community.                13/  Increase in     FY 1999 from May quarterly report is $213 million. Of this, $142.6 million is     for HCFA.                14/  HHS' most     recent estimate of Y2K costs for FY 2000, as reported in their August 1998     quarterly report to OMB, is not reflected in this table. The approximately $550     million in FY 2000 costs is still being reviewed by OMB. Almost all of these     costs are attributable to HCFA.                15/  The FY 1999     and 2000 cost estimates do not include $1.4 and $1.2 million, respectively,     planned for outreach to industry by the Mine Safety and health Administration     and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.                16/  Costs     displayed differ from those reported previously, as they do not include costs     for non-appropriated activities, other sources of funding such as     reimbursements, and diversions of base resources that are not identified in the     99 Budget or as part of official reprogrammings. Costs for programs that do not     receive appropriations are as follows: FY 96: $.2 M, FY 97: $9.4 M, FY 98:     $53.2 M, FY 99: $38.1 M, FY00: $5.4 M. Costs that Treasury is funding through     other sources, such as reimbursements, are as follows: FY: 97: $3.1 M, FY 98:     $15.4 M, FY 99: $48.0 M. Diversions of base resources not identified in the 99     Budget or as part of an official reprogramming are as follows: FY 98: $17.2 M,     FY 99: $70.8 M. (Costs displayed above for FY 1999 include additional needs     verified by OMB.) Additional costs of $34.4 M for FY 2000 have not been     verified by OMB and therefore are not included in the above table.             Appendix B          Agency Exception Reports        Mission-critical Systems Behind Schedule          Department of Commerce              The Patent and Trademark Office reports that the Classified Search     and Image Retrieval (CSIR) system will not be year 2000 compliant by March 31,     1999. The CSIR provides patent examiners with the capability to electronically     search and retrieve U.S. patent images from their desktop workstations. PTO     indicates that the CSIR system will be compliant by June 30, 1999. This system     is delayed due to the contractor's inability to place qualified staff on the     task. A contingency plan was submitted on August 14, 1998 for this system.         Department of Defense               The Department of Defense reports 51 mission critical systems are     behind schedule for fixing year 2000 problems. This is an increase from the 9     reported last quarter. Seven of those previously reported systems remain behind     schedule. In addition, DoD reports that 69 mission critical systems will miss     the March 1999 deadline for being fixed, an increase from the 34 that were     reported in May. These increases are due to DoD's efforts to improve reporting,     impose more stringent validation and testing criteria, and provide senior     management with early warning of any problems that may occur.         Department of Education               In the May quarterly report, Education reported two systems which had     fallen two or more months behind schedule: 1) the Title IV Wide Area Network     (TIVWAN), and 2) the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). TIVWAN had     slipped from a renovation date of 2/98 to 8/98 and NSLDS had slipped from a     renovation date of 6/98 to 8/98. In the August quarterly report, both of these     systems had completed their renovation phases as scheduled and are no longer     listed as exceptions. Also in the August quarterly report Education listed     three systems which have fallen two or more months behind schedule: the Impact     Aid Payment System, the Education Local Area Network, and the Pell Recipients'     Financial Management System. For the Impact Aid Payment System, which is a     replacement system, the renovation phase has been completed, but the validation     and implementation phases have slipped by three and two months respectively     from June 1998 to September 1998, and from July 1998 to September 1998. For the     Education Local Area Network, which is a system being renovated, the renovation     phase completion date has slipped by two months from September 1998 to November     1998. That slippage is being driven by difficulties with one of five     components, the Enterprise Mail Messaging package, which will not be done with     renovation until late November, 1998. For the Pell Recipients' Financial     Management System, the slippage is more severe. The Pell System renovation     phase has slipped by five months, from July 1998 to December 1998. Education     has currently completed 40 percent of the work necessary to finish the     renovation phase for the Pell System.         Department of Energy               In the May quarterly report, the Department had identified six     systems with implementation dates beyond the March 1999 milestone. These six     systems remain with implementation dates beyond the March 1999 milestone in the     August quarterly report. The six systems are at two DOE facilities -- Sandia     National Lab and Savannah River. At the Sandia National Laboratories the system     with the implementation date October 1, 1999, is the Oracle Financial System.     At the Savannah River site there are five systems. The Nuclear Materials     Stabilization Program Operations System (implementation date of September 30,     1999), the Tank Farm Process Control System (implementation date of October 31,     1999), the Tank Farm Manufacturing Support System (implementation date of     August 19, 1999), the Defense Waste Processing Facility Process Control System     (implementation date of October 31, 1999) and the Defense Waste Processing     Facility Manufacturing Support System (implementation date of October 31,     1999).            These are the six system reported by the Department in its August     quarterly report; in addition, however, the Department tracks progress against     its own milestones and has identified 51 systems that are behind their internal     renovation milestones. The Department has 27 systems out of 411 that are behind     their schedule by more than 60 days. DOE also has 43 systems that are being     renovated which are scheduled to be implemented in March 1999.         Department of Health and Human Services               From June status data, HCFA indicated that there were three Medicare     contractors who had deadlines for implementation after March 1999. HCFA     submitted a revision to that data on August 12 indicating that  no      systems were more than two months behind schedule and that there were no     systems which would not be repaired before March 31, 1999. However, there is     still serious concern that some contractors may fail to meet the March     deadline.            In the May quarterly report the Health Resources and Services     Administration's (HRSA) contractor-operated National Organ Transplant System     was projected not to be compliant until a new replacement system was     implemented in July 1999. In the August quarterly report, HRSA reports that the     schedule has been advanced at least 3 months: the National Organ Transplant     System is scheduled to be validated by March 31, 1999, and is scheduled to be     implemented in early April 1999.         Department of Interior               The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System for the     Colorado River Storage Project within the Bureau of Reclamation is used to     manage the Glen Canyon Dam's Power plant and water flow. In the May report,     this system was discussed primarily because the preliminary estimates to     renovate the system were significantly higher than anticipated. A statement of     work was developed requiring a three-phase effort to reassess costs, make     repairs, and test the system for year 2000 compliance. Additionally, a waiver     to the Dual-Compensation Act has been granted for 10 Power plant Operators as     part of a contingency plan that will allow all of the bureau's dams to be     operated in a manual mode. Currently all of the bureau's continuity of     operations manuals are being reviewed with regard to Y2K impact. SCADA is now     considered be back on schedule with renovation, testing, and implementation to     be completed by March 1999.            The Global Seismic Network (GSN) of the U.S. Geological Survey     collects and provides data from the global digital seismic network to     incorporated research institutions. This system is integrated with the global     positioning system and includes information on earthquake assessments, oil     drilling distribution and maintenance and water resource management. Earlier     schedule and budget estimates for GSN were based on data that was incomplete     relative to the severity of several problems in the field system operating     software. A new schedule has been developed to overcome these problems and     result in a compliant system by February 1999.            The Seismic Event Data Analysis System (SEDAS) of the U.S. Geological     Survey contains information pertaining to earthquakes throughout the world. It     is used by USGS researchers for information dissemination. Earlier schedule and     budget estimates for SEDAS were based on repairing an older computer system     which was then discovered to be too old for reliable Y2K renovation. A new     system is now being procured and a revised schedule has been developed for a     compliant system to be in place by January 1999.            The U.S. National Seismograph Network (USNSN) of the U.S. Geological     Survey (USGS) provides the hardware and the software for the Water Resources     Division of USGS for scientific, accounting, and personnel information. Earlier     schedule and budget estimates for USNSN were revised after determining that     there is a much more comprehensive method for testing and validating total     system Y2K compliance than was originally envisioned. The slip in the     validation schedule is due to expanded testing of the system and revisions to     the testing schedule itself. The system is currently scheduled for validation     in October 1998, implementation in November 1998, and IV&V in December     1998.         Department of Justice               The most recent quarterly report shows that 13 systems will miss     internal Justice milestones for assessment, renovation or validation, but the     Department insists that all these systems will meet the Department's January     1999 deadline for completion of implementation. In addition, Justice has     identified three mission critical systems that will miss the government-wide     March 1999 implementation deadline. First, the Digital Monitoring Workstations     in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) support investigative collections     for authorized foreign counterintelligence surveillance and were found to be     non-year 2000 compliant. The FBI is replacing the twelve systems at the rate of     approximately one per month, and they should be fully implemented by October     1999. Second, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has decided to     perform replacement of its mission-critical Local Area Network and its     non-mission critical workstation/office automation upgrades simultaneously.     Because a large number of sites are involved, INS will be unable to complete     replacement of this infrastructure until July 1999. Third, Justice is replacing     the Card Key System for its Washington, DC headquarters as part of the     building's overall renovation; this renovation won't be finished until after     March 1999.         State Department               The Supply Automated Receiving System (SARS), Enhanced Automated     Procurement System (EAPCS), Mail Sorting Equipment Network (MSE), and the     Electronic Receipts System (ERS) within the Bureau of Administration will all     miss their September renovation milestones. In its last report, State expected     these systems to be back on schedule in June, 1998. Early delays involved     evaluation of commercial off-the-shelf system alternatives, funding requests     and contract modifications. Renovation of the SARS is scheduled for completion     in November 1998, and acceptance testing will be completed in March 1999.     Assessment of EAPCS is now completed, and implementation is scheduled for     February 1999. Renovation of MSE will begin in November, and certification and     implementation is scheduled to be completed in March 1999.            State had previously reported the Office of Personnel's Medical     Archiving Retrieval System (MARS) as extending beyond the September 1998     renovation milestone, but this system has been subsequently been reclassified     as a non-mission critical system. Deployment of the ALMA (A Logical     Modernization Approach) upgrades to over 230 State Department posts worldwide     will not be completed until April 1999. Included in the ALMA package are a     number of Consular Affairs mission critical systems, including the Automated     Citizen Services function, Modernized Immigrant Visa system, Non-Immigrant Visa     and Computer Assisted Processing systems, and the Travel Document Issuance     System. Through July 1998, ALMA has been deployed to 105 posts worldwide,     meeting 92 percent of State's target goals. State is preparing continuity of     business plans should any posts or embassies not have ALMA installed in time to     meet the millennium.         Department of Transportation               The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is faced with a significant     challenge in validating and implementing hundreds of systems, particularly air     traffic control systems which require extensive end-to-end testing. At the     present time, the FAA estimates that 62 systems will not be implemented by     March 1999, a number of which are critical to FAA's telecommunications and data     exchange infrastructure. The FAA presently expects to complete validation     activities by March 1999 and implementation activities by June 1999. As stated     in the report, the FAA needs to reevaluate its master schedule and make a     concerted effort to accelerate its implementation schedule for all systems to     March 1999, or as soon thereafter as possible.            The U.S. Coast Guard reports that its consolidated accounting system,     the Finance Center Information Resources Management System, has fallen behind     schedule and will likely miss the March 1999 implementation date. The three     systems reported as behind schedule in the previous quarter are now back on     schedule. In addition, the Automated Aids Positioning System, which is still in     development, was recently identified as having year 2000 vulnerabilities, but     is expected to be implemented by the March 1999 milestone date and will not be     fielded until fully compliant.         Treasury Department               GOALS, a FMS system that was to have been implemented after the     government wide deadlines, is now on target to be compliant by March 1999. The     Government On-Line Accounting Link System (GOALS) at the Financial Management     Service is comprised of 18 application subsystems that collect, edit, and     telecommunicate data. GOALS-II was initiated in September 1995 to replace     GOALS-I. Based on the analysis of the current development schedule, not all of     the 18 subsystems of GOALS-II will be completed and implemented prior to the     year 2000. Consequently, FMS determined that it must renovate the existing     GOALS-I system to ensure year 2000 compliance. In the May report, GOALS was     described as a system that would be compliant after the March 1999     government-wide deadline. Based on a finalized assessment of GOALS, however,     all critical applications have been scheduled for completion on or before March     1999.         General Services Administration               The General Services Administration identified one system, the     Acquisition Management Program (AMP) as being delayed by more than two months,     slipping from May 1998 to October 1998. AMP is used to manage the funds used to     acquire vehicles at Fleet Management Centers throughout the nation. GSA decided     to implement the system at the beginning of the fiscal year allowing the host     computer platform to be upgraded.         Agency for International Development               Two AID mission critical systems will be implemented after the March     1999 goal. The Mission Accounting and Control System (MACS) will take longer to     renovate than originally planned and is scheduled for implementation in May of     1999. The Agency's complex financial management, procurement, budget and     program management system, called the New Management Systems (NMS) is scheduled     for implementation in August 1999. AID will have contingency plans in place for     both of these systems by February 1999. Additionally, AID will not have     assurances until April 1999 that all of its desktop personnel computers are     both year 2000 compliant and able to support other mission critical     applications such as the American Time and Attendance. AID is working to     accelerate deployment of its new desktop infrastructure in order to support     deployment of mission critical applications.

GX036-78-2860145	"VIA Metropolitan Transit         VIA Metropolitan Transit     Background     VIA Metropolitan Transit (VIA) is a metropolitan transit authority created according to Article 1118x of the revised Texas civil statutes to provide transportation services to the citizens of Bexar County.  In November 1977, voters approved the creation and funding of VIA through a one-half cent sales tax to be levied in San Antonio and seven other incorporated municipalities.  VIA's service area is 1,232 square miles, which is most of Bexar county.  VIA provides limited services to the 11 counties surrounding Bexar.   VIA operates over 525 buses, 26 streetcars, 40 minibuses, and 156 paratransit vehicles.  VIA employs over 1,840 people, with 1,438 working in transit operations and maintenance and 402 in administrative and support positions.  VIA does not employ any transit police.   The operating budget for fiscal 1996 is $88 million.  VIA's capital budget is $7 million, and is designated for new maintenance and terminal facilities and new rolling stock.  The sources of 1996 operating and capital budgets are summarized below:           Funding Source   Operating       Capital         Farebox Revenues 16.8% 6.8%    Sales Tax Receipts (1/2 of 1 percent) 65.5% 26.3%    Federal Grants 6.7% 62.5%    Interest 6.7% 2.7%    Charter and Miscellaneous 4.3% 1.7%     ______ ______    Total  100.0%   100.0%    1    During our visit, we interviewed all the members of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) staff.  We also interviewed several senior management members of VIA.  These included the General Manager, the Director of Finance, the Director of Bus Operations, the Director of Paratransit Operations, the Director of Design & Construction, and the former Director of Internal Audit, now the Chief of Management Systems Analysis.  No Board members were available for interviews at the time of our site visit.           Internal Audit Department Mission and Organization     The Board of Trustees (Board) established the IAD in 1987.  The IAD's current mission statement, adopted in 1992, is . . .            ""To contribute to the VIA mission by providing objective examinations and evaluation of VIA accounting, financial, and operational activities as a service to management and the Board of Trustees and as an independent appraisal function.""     The IAD reports functionally and administratively to the General Manager.  The IAD has a ""dotted line"" reporting relationship with the Board Audit Committee.   The Director of the IAD usually meets with the Audit Committee four times per year and with the General Manager one a month.      The IAD currently consists of three people.  Besides the Director of Audit, there are two Auditor IIs on staff.  One staff position is vacant.  There is no distinction made as to EDP, contract or internal audit functions within the department.     The General Manager provides the initial approval for the IAD's annual budget. Ultimately, the Board approves the final budget.  The fiscal year 1995 budget, summarized below, includes an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately 4.5%, while the total budget increased by 5.7%.      Budget   % of Budget     Salaries and Benefits $117,500 96.3%    Travel, Training 3,600 3.0%    Supplies, etc.  900  .7%        _______ ______    Total  $122,000   100.0%    The IAD is responsible for contracting with the independent auditors for the annual single audit.       Audit Planning and Risk Assessment    The IAD prepares an audit plan annually.  IAD reviews the activities of each functional department to determine the ""high risk"" areas.  From this list, IAD prepares the audit plan and submits it to the Audit Committee and the General Manager for approval.  The audit schedule for internal audits also allows some flexibility for special requests.     Board members each receive copies of the audit plan.  However, department heads do not receive copies of the audit plan, nor do they have much say as to the allocation of audit resources.    Audit Scope and Coverage    The IAD has unlimited access to all area of operations.  Audit resources are currently allocated between transit operations (35%) and functional departments (65%) such as; Risk Management, Customer Service, Finance and Administration, etc.  Audit resources are also allocated by activity as follows:        Audits and Reviews 65%    Training 5%    Vacations and Holidays 4%    Administration, other 26%     ____    Total  100%    On average, audits require 6 work weeks (240 hours).  The philosophy of the IAD is to stay focused on the identified audit objectives and not spend too much time developing detailed solutions.      Use of Technology    Last year, for the first time, the IAD instituted a control self-assessment process at VIA.  The IAD gave each department head a package of forms or questionnaires, along with a summary description of internal control concepts, with instructions to evaluate the controls in their department.   The IAD has three computers allocated to its staff including two 286-chip based machines and one 486-chip based machine.  The IAD hopes to buy three more 486-chip based machines in the next year.  Office productivity software includes Excel®, Lotus 1.2.3®, and Graphic Outlook® for spreadsheet software.  WordPerfect® is used for word processing.  At this time, the IAD does not use any audit resource management or risk assessment software.    Audit Reports and Follow Up    The IAD issues formal audit reports, compliant with GAO ""Yellow Book"" standards, using interoffice memorandum letterhead.  Auditees review reports in the draft stage and have three days to decide whether to request an exit conference.  Quality assurance procedures for audit reports are the responsibility of the lead auditor and the Director.  In addition to the auditee, the General Manager receives a copy of the final report.   The IAD reviews audit results with the Audit Committee.  Copies of audit reports are available to the Board and become public records under the Texas Open Records Act.   Six weeks after the report is issued, the auditee must furnish the IAD with a formal response and plan of action.  The auditee must provide corrective action updates to the IAD every 90 days until actions are completed.    Staff Characteristics and Hiring Practices    As discussed above, the IAD consists of three people, although there is one unfilled Auditor I position.  Two of the three staff members have been with VIA less than four months.  All three staff members are CPAs and one is a Certified Fraud Examiner.  When hiring personnel, the Director considers public accounting experience most important, followed by government industry experience.  Staff members receive at least 40 hours of continuing education each year.   Staff evaluations are performed on Authority-wide personnel forms.  Emphasis is placed on quality of written reports, number of recommendations implemented by auditees, customer satisfaction, and timeliness of audit completion.   VIA has a history of placing its audit directors into other management positions.  Both the Director of Finance and the Chief of Management Systems Analysis are former Directors of the IAD.    Quality Influencers    The IAD staff belong to several professional organizations, but are only somewhat active in one, the Institute for Internal Auditors (IIA).  VIA pays the cost of memberships in the IIA, AICPA, and the State Society of CPAs, including the local chapter.    Government Auditing Standards (GAS) require audit departments that perform GAS audits to submit to an external quality assurance or peer review program.  No peer reviews are contemplated at this time.    IAD Effectiveness and Impact on Agency    Senior management members have high opinions of the audit function as currently structured.  Management would like to see the audit function broadened towards more of a consulting or performance audit role.  Efforts are underway to incorporate more performance and operational reviews into the audit plan.    Departmental Strengths or Best Practices    The IAD has developed a few practices they believe are worth sharing with other transit internal auditors.    Control Self Assessment -As discussed above, the IAD implemented a control self-assessment process last year.  The IAD provided each department with control questionnaires for supervisory personnel to complete.   In addition, the IAD provided background information describing internal control concepts to each department.  IAD staff also described at least three examples of risks, for each department, to stimulate the review process.  Besides educating department heads about the importance of internal controls, the exercise generated additional ideas for future audits and reviews.     The IAD will use this process again, but has not determined how often to repeat it.    Construction Labor Costs -VIA has had difficulty, on occasion, with contractors paying less than scale wages to employees or hiring illegal immigrants, and paying much less than contracted wages.  VIA also has a desire to review the number of laborers at a job site with other project management records to verify the labor charges on large projects.  The IAD has implemented two practices to address these concerns, as follows:         Site Work Observation Forms -To facilitate counting workers at a large job site, IAD designed a color-coded workpaper on which check marks could be placed next to descriptions of various worker attributes, such as the color of hats, shirts, pants, and hair.  Columns on the workpaper also allow for noting the trade or activity performed by the worker, firm affiliation, name, and other comments.  IAD uses a separate form when conducting quick interviews with employees to determine their names and job functions.  With this information, it is much easier to verify the contractor's certified payroll for that day.         Verification of Laborers -Occasionally, the IAD suspects that a contractor is reporting workers at different crafts (and different wage scales) than the ones actually performed.  In those cases, the IAD has found it helpful to take a camera to the job site and begin photographing workers performing their tasks.  Often, illegal or ""misposted"" workers will disappear and only a skeleton crew will remain.  Auditors can then follow-up with the contractor to verify employment and project records.

Supplements should not expand the original scope of parent grant. The source of HESC will be limited to federally approved stem cell lines listed on the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry, which can be found at  http://escr.nih.gov .    Background   On August 9, 2001, President Bush announced his decision to allow Federal funds to be used for research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines. Subsequently, the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry was created to provide a listing of federally approved Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines ( http://escr.nih.gov ) that may be used for such research. The availability of HESC for federally funded research affords an unique opportunity for investigators to use these cells to address fundamental research questions. However, most investigators have had little or no prior experience in working with HESC and have not had the opportunity to propose experiments utilizing HESC in their grant applications. A recent report of an NIGMS workshop on the Basic Biology of Mammalian Stem Cells, which can be found at  http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/reports/stemcellworkshop.html , summarizes many fascinating opportunities to use HESC as a model system to study important biological problems. This notice provides the opportunity for NIGMS grantees to incorporate the use of HESC into their experimental plan when the proposed research falls within the original scope of the parent grant and is a logical extension of the goals and objectives.    Mechanism of Support   Awards will be made through administrative supplements to R01, R37, P01 and S06 awards. Applications may request up to $75,000 in direct costs per year, for up to the duration of the funded grant period. NIGMS has set aside $1.5 million to support successful applications. Grantees may request funds for small items of equipment, supplies and personnel to work with HESC. Funds may be requested to support travel to acquire necessary expertise.    Eligibility Requirements   The PI must have an active NIGMS R01, R37, P01 or S06 research grant. The parent grant must have at least 18 months of support remaining at the time of submission. An investigator will be allowed only one supplemental award under this program.   Where to Send Inquiries   Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss eligibility requirements with NIGMS staff before preparing an application. We welcome the opportunity to clarify any issues or questions from potential applicants.    Please direct inquiries to the program director listed on your award statement, or to:   Marion Zatz, Ph.D. Program Director NIGMS Telephone: (301) 594-0943 E-mail:  zatzm@nigms.nih.gov   Inquiries regarding NIH grant policy or fiscal matters should be directed to:   Ms. Marcia Cohn Grants Management Officer NIGMS Telephone: (301) 594-3918 E-mail:  cohnm@nigms.nih.gov   Submitting an Application   This is one-time solicitation with a single receipt date of April 1, 2004. Requests for supplemental support must be submitted on the PHS 398 Form (Rev. 5/2001), which may be obtained at  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html .    The identifying number(s) of the approved stem cell line(s) to be used MUST be included in the abstract of the application. Applications that do not specify an approved cell line listed on the NIH Human Stem Cell Registry ( http://escr.nih.gov ) will be returned to the applicant without further review.    The grantee institution, on behalf of the principal investigator of the parent grant, must submit the request for supplemental funds directly to NIGMS. The request is NOT to be submitted to the NIH Center for Scientific Review. Send an original and four copies of your application to the NIGMS address below by April 1, 2004.    Submit requests to:   Marion Zatz, Ph.D. Program Director Division of Genetics and Developmental Biology NIGMS Building 45, Room 2AS-25E MSC 6200 Bethesda, MD 20892-6200 Telephone: (301) 594-0943 E-mail:  zatzm@nigms.nih.gov   Application Contents   Include the following in the application:     Completed PHS 398 Face Page. Write the number of the parent grant on the top of the page. The name of this announcement, “NIGMS Administrative Supplements for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research,” should be entered on line 2.      Abstract Page. It must contain a description of the proposed supplemental activity, how it is related to the parent grant, and the identifying number(s) of the HESC lines to be used.     Budget Justification Page(s). Up to $75,000 direct costs may be requested for salary and fringe benefits of key personnel, for costs of procuring HESC, for supplies and small items of equipment, and for travel. The term of support may extend to the end of the funded project, but not beyond it.      A description of plans to obtain HESC, including status of application for required material transfer agreements (MTA).     Facilities and Administrative Costs Page of PHS 398 Form Checklist.     A research plan, not to exceed five pages, that includes the following: a) rationale for the use of HESC as a model system to further the goals of the research grant; b) description of experimental design and methods of the proposed supplemental research, including plans to grow and maintain HESC; c) plans of the PI and key personnel to acquire expertise in working with HESC, or documentation of existing expertise; d) description of facilities and the research environment for research utilizing HESC; and e) description of any collaborative arrangements; letters of support from collaborators and/or consultants should be appended to the research plan.    Review Process   Requests that are responsive to this administrative supplement announcement will be reviewed by NIGMS staff, in consultation with external reviewers as needed. Upon receipt, requests will be reviewed for completeness and eligibility. Applicants are required to include in the abstract the NIH code number identifying the approved HESC line(s) to be used in the proposed research. Applications that do not provide this information will be returned without review. It is anticipated that successful applications will be awarded within four months of the receipt date.    Review Criteria       Does the PI provide a convincing rationale for the use of HESC as a model system to advance the aims of the parent grant?   Are the experimental plans described in sufficient detail? Are they logical extensions of the goals and objectives of the parent grant?   Are the plans to obtain and utilize HESC adequately described?   Are the facilities and the research environment appropriate for the use of HESC?   Does the experience of the PI and key personnel appear adequate for research with HESC? If added expertise is needed, have appropriate plans been presented to acquire additional expertise?   If collaborative or consulting arrangements are proposed, do they appear to be adequate to support the proposed research?   Is the proposed budget reasonable?   Are the administrative arrangements to procure HESC, including necessary MTAs, spelled-out and reasonable?   Award Criteria   All awards are subject to the availability of funds. No awards can be made until adequate arrangements for the procurement of HESC are documented.    Questions and Answers   PIs are encouraged to visit the NIH Stem Cell Information Webpage at  http://stemcells.nih.gov/  for additional information on the use of HESC and to look at the questions and answers below.   Q :  Do I need Institutional Review Board review for research using human embryonic stem cells?     A : It depends. Applicants and their institutional officials are encouraged to review guidance from the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) regarding this issue, Guidance for Investigators and Institutional Review Boards Regarding Research Involving Human Embryonic Stem Cells, Germ Cells and Cell-Derived Test Articles, at  http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/humansubjects/guidance/stemcell.pdf .   Q :  I have read a lot about HESC, but I have never used them in an experiment. Can I apply for a supplement, even though I have no experience with these cells?   A : Yes, but you need to demonstrate plans for key personnel to obtain and develop needed expertise. See  http://stemcells.nih.gov/rschFunding/trngGrants.asp  for available training courses.   Q :  I did not propose to use HESC when I wrote my grant? May I apply for a HESC supplement as a new aim of my research?   A : No, but you can apply for a supplement to use HESC as a model system to address your existing aims, as long as the proposed research is a logical extension of work proposed in the parent grant and does not constitute an expansion of the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    TOP OF PAGE                                                                                                               Research Funding  |  Training & Careers  |  Minority Programs           News & Events  |  About NIGMS  |  NIGMS Home  |  NIH Home                     Privacy  |  Accessibility  |  Disclaimer  |  Contact Us                    Last reviewed:  September 2, 2003
GX256-77-8055276	"IG's Message for the Secretary  UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE The Inspector General Washington, D.C. 20230  October 31, 1999 The Honorable William M. Daley Secretary of Commerce Washington, DC 20230 Mr. Secretary: I am pleased to provide you with the Office of Inspector General's semiannual report to the Congress for the second half of fiscal year 1999. Section 5 of the Inspector General Act requires that you transmit this report, with any comments you may wish to add, to the appropriate congressional committees within 30 days of its receipt. This is the first semiannual report that I will be submitting to you and the Congress since I was sworn in as Inspector General in July. I appreciate the support you provided during my tenure as Acting IG, and I look forward to continuing to work with you to improve departmental operations. I believe that the efforts described in this report demonstrate the value of the cooperative, productive relationships that we have tried to foster between OIG officials and your Executive Management Team. The first section of the enclosed report discusses what we have identified as the major challenges facing the Department. For each challenge, we highlight the progress made in the past six months, as well as further actions that we believe need to be taken. As you might expect, we have focused considerable time and effort on monitoring the Department's efforts to address three of the most visible and immediate challenges--improving the accuracy and controlling the cost of the 2000 Decennial Census, addressing the Y2K problem, and improving financial management. Much progress has been made in these areas, but continued oversight is essential. This report also describes the progress made to address other major challenges, most notably the challenges of expanding private sector participation in NOAA's marine and aeronautical data gathering, implementing the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System, and resolving issues relating to NTIS's mission and financial viability.

(Inside Back Cover ) ii Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress FOREWORD We continue to devote a large portion of our resources to exploring what we have identified as the major challenges facing the Department. A primary focus during the past six months has been on three of these challenges--the 2000 Decennial Census, the Y2K problem, and financial management. In addition, we examined a broad array of important Commerce programs, including the Department's efforts to control the export of sensitive technologies and munitions. We conducted four reviews of key aspects of the decennial during this semiannual period. One examined the operation during the Census Dress Rehearsal of the quality check survey, which will be used to independently measure the quality of the direct count of the population. Another looked at multiple response resolution, a process designed to help ensure that no one is counted more than once. A third considered whether the Census Bureau had done all it could to ensure the effectiveness of its public awareness campaign. And a fourth assessed the bureau's plans for archiving decennial data and disposing of questionnaires to ensure that sensitive information will be protected. The bureau has taken prompt action to address the concerns and recommendations discussed in our reports. In addition, as part of an ongoing review of efforts by the Department and its bureaus to ensure that their critical computer systems are Y2K compliant, we completed our examination of the Y2K compliance activities of two Commerce operating units--the Patent and Trademark Office and NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. Overall, both agencies' systems were ready to handle the change to the year 2000, but we made recommendations concerning retesting and contingency planning designed to further decrease the risk of service disruptions. We will also be reporting in the near future on the Y2K status of several other important Commerce agencies, including the Census Bureau and the National Weather Service. Although our audits of the Department's FY 1999 financial statements will not be completed until next March, we have worked with departmental and bureau managers on an ongoing basis to improve financial management and reporting. For example, we have participated in several forums on financial management issues and have met regularly with departmental financial managers to discuss issues of mutual concern. Several major OIG reviews completed during this period looked at export-related programs managed by BXA and ITA. For example, at the request of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, we and five other OIGs conducted an interagency review of the export licensing process for dualuse commodities and munitions, and testified on the review results. In keeping with the intent of the requirements of the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, we also continued to examine U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service overseas operations, reporting on our reviews of the posts in Brazil, China, and South Africa. In addition, the Inspector General testified on the progress being made in implementing the U.S. Export Assistance Centers as ""one-stop shops"" providing a wide range of federal assistance to U.S. exporters. We plan to continue our work on these critical Commerce issues in order to provide departmental and congressional decision-makers with the sound, objective information and recommendations they need to take decisive action to meet the major challenges facing the Department.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  1   IG's Message for the Congress  Major Challenges for the Department  MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE DEPARTMENT The Department of Commerce, with its many important and diverse programs and missions, is faced with its share of problems, concerns, and difficult issues that we view as key management challenges. This section highlights what we consider to be the major challenges facing the Department. We have identified these issues as major challenges because of their importance to the Department's mission or the nation's well-being, their complexity, their sizable expenditures, or their need for management improvements. By addressing these challenges, the Department and the Congress can improve program management, eliminate serious operational problems, decrease vulnerability to fraud and waste, and achieve significant cost savings. on various aspects of the Census Bureau's decennial preparation efforts, and additional reviews are underway. We have made numerous recommendations aimed at helping to improve the accuracy of the 2000 census and control its cost. Likewise, we have conducted audits and inspections of other Census Bureau activities and operations (such as financial management systems, interagency agreements, and Y2K compliance efforts) that may indirectly affect the bureau's ability to conduct the decennial efficiently and effectively. In all instances, we are actively monitoring the bureau's efforts to address the recommendations made in our reports. In the last issue of our semiannual report, we reported on a number of problems with bureau processes and operations, some of which, if not corrected, could have serious implications for the decennial. For example, our review of the 1998 dress rehearsal operation of a pre-production version of DCS 2000, the data capture system being developed for the decennial census, disclosed that the system experienced serious problems in processing dress rehearsal forms as a result of inadequate control of system requirements and insufficient testing (see March 1999 issue, page 30). Also, our review of the bureau's use of interagency and other special agreements identified the need for significant improvements in the agreements themselves, as well as in the policies and procedures for preparing, reviewing, and tracking them (see March 1999 issue, page 32). In addition, our review of a Census Bureau regional office's use of bankcards called for strengthening internal controls over bankcard purchases (see March 1999 issue, page 34). We are pleased to report that in all three instances, the bureau has been working hard to address our concerns, and that many corrective actions have already been taken.  Increase the Accuracy and Control the Cost of the 2000 Decennial Census The decennial census is an enormous and complex task--certainly one of the most difficult that the federal government has to undertake. The accuracy of the data produced by the decennial is critical because it is the basis for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and is used by state legislatures for redistricting purposes. The data is also used to distribute billions of dollars of federal funds to state and local governments. The Department recognizes the challenges presented by the 2000 Decennial Census and is clearly providing increased oversight and management support to this important undertaking. Given the complexity and importance of the 2000 decennial, we continue to make oversight of decennial planning one of our top priorities. We have already issued nearly 20 audit and inspection reports  2  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress In several reviews completed during this semiannual period, we expressed a number of additional concerns that need to be addressed in preparing for the 2000 decennial. Specifically: l  Our review of the 1998 dress rehearsal test of the quality check survey identified the need for improvements prior to the decennial (see page 24). Our review of the bureau's planned approach for ensuring that multiple responses to the decennial received from the same housing units are resolved correctly and on schedule identified the need for modifications to ensure accurate, timely processing (see page 26). Our review of the bureau's plans for archiving decennial data and disposing of questionnaires identified the need for the bureau to select the method it proposes to use to archive the decennial data and to finalize its procedures for disposing of the questionnaires (see page 30).  l  For example, the bureau originally planned to integrate statistical methods into the decennial census design to produce a single-number count, rather than two sets of totals, as was done in 1990. However, in November 1998, the administration agreed that the bureau would plan for both a sampling and a non-sampling census while awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of using sampling techniques as part of the decennial census methodology. On January 25, 1999, the Court ruled that, according to the Census Act of 1986, statistical sampling techniques cannot be used for apportionment. But the bureau still intends to provide a statistically adjusted number for non-apportionment purposes, believing that the adjusted count is more accurate.  Major Challenges for the Department  l  Obtain an Unqualified Opinion on All of the Department's Consolidated Financial Statements The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 were designed to improve the financial management practices of federal agencies. The statutes require annual financial statements audits that present an entity's financial position and results of operations and provide other information needed for the Congress, agency executives, and the public to assess management's performance. The Department received an unqualified opinion on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 1998. However, because the Department had received a disclaimer of opinion on its FY 1997 financial statements, we were unable to express an opinion on its Consolidating Statements of Net Cost and Changes in Net Position and Combined Statements of Budgetary Resources and Financing for the year ended September 30, 1998 (see March 1999 issue, page 76). In addition, individual disclaimers on these FY 1998 financial statements of 3  Of equal note, our work revealed that a number of activities critical to the decennial are working well. Foremost, in our recent audit of the bureau's public awareness campaign, we found that the paid advertising campaign has been planned and, in its early stages, implemented in a manner that is meeting its program objectives. In addition, the partnership program--the other component of the public awareness campaign--has been effective in establishing relationships with state and local governments and other organizations essential to conducting an accurate census. Together, these two approaches are being aggressively pursued to increase the mail response rate and reduce the undercount (see page 28). The Department continues to face challenges as it grapples with the logistical, technical, and other issues involved in conducting the 2000 decennial. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress NOAA, the Bureau of the Census, and the Franchise Fund, along with the fact that ITA's FY 1998 statements could not be audited, resulted in the disclaimer on the Department's other FY 1998 consolidated financial statements. Although the Department and several bureaus received improved audit opinions on their FY 1998 financial statements, it will not be easy for the Department to obtain an unqualified opinion on all of its FY 1999 financial statements. Further improvements are necessary. NOAA and the Census Bureau, for example, face some special challenges and must be proactive in identifying and resolving the potential impediments to the preparation and audit of their FY 1999 financial statements. In addition, the FY 1999 audit of ITA's financial statements will constitute, in essence, a first-year audit. It is typically difficult for federal organizations to receive an opinion on all financial statements in the first year. Until these bureaus receive other than disclaimers on their remaining statements, it is unlikely that the Department will receive an unqualified opinion on all of its consolidated financial statements. It is important to highlight, however, the progress that has been made in addressing many of the problems, weaknesses, and conditions that have undermined the reliability of some bureaus' financial management systems and precluded unqualified opinions on their financial statements. This is probably most apparent in the decrease in the number of ""material weaknesses"" over the past two years--from 37 in FY 1996 to only 12 in FY 1998. Material weaknesses represent serious conditions where the design or operation of an internal control component does not minimize the risk that errors, fraud, or noncompliance in material amounts may occur and not be readily detected. The substantial progress made in reducing the number of material weaknesses reflects the Department's commitment to establishing sound financial manage4 ment systems, improving financial management, and achieving an unqualified opinion on all of its financial statements. Obtaining an unqualified audit opinion on all of the Department's FY 1999 consolidated financial statements is still a major challenge. But, as progress is being made, it is also becoming increasingly clear that the extensive cooperation among the Department, the bureaus, the OIG, and the OIG's contractors is going a long way toward further reducing the number of material weaknesses and bringing the Department closer to achieving an unqualified opinion. Our audits of the Department's FY 1999 financial statements will be completed during the next semiannual period. Nevertheless, we have worked with departmental and bureau managers during this period to improve financial management and reporting. For example, we have participated in such ongoing forums as the GPRA Task Force and the Accountability Report Committee. We have also met regularly with the Department's CFO Office to discuss issues that affect the consolidated financial statements and to provide coordinated comments to OMB on audit and financial reporting regulations.  Major Challenges for the Department  Address Commerce's Year 2000 Computer Problem As the century draws to a close, we continue to play an important role in monitoring and highlighting key issues related to addressing the Y2K problem in Commerce computer systems and in recommending actions to mitigate the risk of Y2K failures. In our last issue (see March 1999 issue, page 78), we discussed the results of our inspection of the Department's efforts to improve the accuracy of its reporting of its systems' Y2K compliance status. In this issue, we discuss the findings of some of our specific evaluations of the efforts made by individual bureaus to ensure that their critical automated systems are, in fact, Y2K compliant. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress Our review of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service's process for renovating selected critical systems concluded that the likelihood of Y2K failure is low because these systems are not susceptible to many Y2K problems and because NESDIS exercised stringent quality control over system renovations and conducted thorough ""end-to-end"" tests (see page 48). Our review of selected critical systems at the Patent and Trademark Office found that they have been made Y2K compliant and were adequately tested (see page 60). For both agencies, we identified the need to ensure that system inventories are complete and that any new systems identified by the inventories are made Y2K compliant. Both agencies also need policies to require that software changes to critical systems be limited or frozen after they are made Y2K compliant and that systems be retested if they are changed. NESDIS agreed with all of our recommendations. PTO agreed with all but one of our recommendations--that it conduct an end-to-end test of several of its critical systems. We also reviewed NESDIS's business continuity and contingency plan (BCCP). NESDIS agreed with our recommendation that it augment its standard procedures for handling problems with its satellite operations and data processing with contingencies for Y2K-specific failures. We are completing our review of PTO's BCCP and will report on our findings in the near future. We are encouraged by our observations and other evidence showing that the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Information Officer remain committed to carrying out activities needed to ensure that systems are Y2K compliant. The Department reported that all of its 473 mission-critical systems were compliant as of September 30, 1999. The remaining challenge is for Commerce managers to ensure that the needed attention is directed to (1) testing and improving BCCPs, (2) ensuring that all systems have been identified and that any that were missed are confirmed to be compliant, and (3) maintaining compliance by freezing or minimizing further changes and retesting systems that are changed. We are continuing to monitor the Department's Y2K program and are currently completing our evaluations of the readiness of the National Weather Service and the Census Bureau. We will apprise the Department and the bureaus of any concerns and recommendations we may have as quickly as possible. In our next issue, we plan to report on the bureaus' transition of their systems to the year 2000.  Major Challenges for the Department  Successfully Implement NWS's Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), the key integrating element of the National Weather Service's modernization program and an essential ingredient to achieving intended operational improvements and staff reductions, is also the last major system of the modernization to be implemented. AWIPS is intended to provide the capability to acquire data from advanced observing systems and to give forecasters tools to rapidly analyze the data, integrate it with the information provided by weather service guidance centers, and prepare timely and accurate warnings and forecasts for dissemination to the public and the media. The AWIPS development program is operating under a congressionally mandated cost cap of $550 million as a result of its history of escalating costs and schedule delays. Under the cap, AWIPS must be developed to provide sufficient capabilities to replace the aging field office systems, most notably the Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS). In our last issue, we reported that 5  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress NOAA planned to complete AWIPS by June 1999. We also noted that the operational test and evaluation, which NOAA planned to conduct in May and June 1999, needed to clearly demonstrate that AWIPS has the capabilities to replace AFOS. The operational test and evaluation of AWIPS, which was conducted as planned, showed that while much of the software is capable of replacing AFOS, some additional improvements are needed before the system can officially be used as the primary system for preparation and distribution of NWS data products (i.e., before AWIPS can be commissioned) and before AFOS is no longer the official system for this purpose (i.e., before AFOS can be decommissioned). NOAA has implemented corrections to commissioning-related problems identified during the operational test and evaluation and is in the process of correcting other problems found after testing that would prevent commissioning. Deployment of AWIPS hardware was completed on schedule in June 1999. NOAA projects that the total base program cost at completion, including corrections for software and hardware problems, will fall within the cap. We are encouraged by NOAA's recent efforts, and we are continuing to monitor AWIPS's progress toward fully replacing AFOS and becoming commissioned. Notwithstanding large investments of time, money, and effort, implementation of the system, known as the Commerce Administrative Management System (CAMS), proved more difficult than anticipated. The difficulties occurred, in part, because the original CAMS contractor did not meet established milestones and experienced problems in satisfying departmental requirements. These factors caused the Department to revise its implementation strategy and schedule several times. During FY 1998, the Department redefined the composition and functionality of CAMS and drastically revised its implementation strategy for the system. The Department also reorganized its management structure for the CAMS systems development program. The revised strategy called for pilot implementation and testing of the redefined CAMS (core CAMS) at the Census Bureau before deploying the system at other bureaus. The pilot implementation of core CAMS at Census was completed in June 1998. An independent verification and validation study of the system, as implemented at Census, concluded that it met departmental requirements and was as good as or better than other core financial management systems that have been fully implemented at other large federal government agencies. In September 1998, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration, using the results of the independent study, completed a business case analysis of CAMS. The analysis compared alternative strategies for implementing core CAMS and recommended a modified approach, which involved implementing core CAMS at the larger bureaus and having the smaller bureaus obtain financial services through cross-servicing agreements. The Department agreed with the recommendation and decided that core CAMS would be implemented next at NOAA and then at NIST.  Major Challenges for the Department  Successfully Implement a Department-Wide Financial Management System The Department's FY 1999 report to the President on management and internal accounting controls is again expected to state that Commerce is not in compliance with the requirement that each federal agency have a single, integrated financial management system capable of providing timely, complete, and reliable financial information. To address this material internal control weakness, Commerce began developing a Department-wide financial system in 1992. 6  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress NOAA initially developed a two-year plan to implement core CAMS. However, in January 1999, NOAA established a limit on the funds available for implementation of core CAMS, effectively extending the implementation schedule to three years. In discussing Commerce's FY 2000 budget request, Office of Management and Budget officials suggested that the Department consider acquiring accounting services for NOAA from the Department of the Interior. Accordingly, in February 1999, the Department's Chief Financial Officer asked Interior if it could provide the same financial management services, using American Management System's Federal Financial System, at a more competitive cost and with lower management risk than could be provided by CAMS. In April 1999, NOAA completed an analysis that compared the cost, schedule, risks, and requirements of implementing CAMS to obtaining the accounting services from Interior. The analysis concluded that implementing CAMS would be less costly and risky and would better meet NOAA's requirements. In May 1999, the Acting Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration agreed with NOAA and informed the Secretary of her decision to proceed with implementation of core CAMS at NOAA. FY 1999 marked a significant milestone for the Department in its implementation of CAMS. The Census Bureau continued full production of core CAMS, deployed access to regional and decennial census sites, and implemented additional modules for travel, budget, and inventory functions. Also, the Economic Development Administration began implementing core CAMS in support of its financial assistance programs. NOAA continued its implementation of CAMS, with the conversion of accounts payable transactions as well as a very limited amount of small purchase acquisitions. In addition, the Department undertook an initiative to develop a corporate database to integrate financial data from all reporting entities. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  NIST intends to complete its implementation plan for core CAMS in FY 2000. After an independent verification and validation study of the plan, NIST will begin implementing the system in FY 2001. Until the Department is in compliance with the federal requirement for a single, integrated financial system, we will view the Department's efforts to develop such a system as a major challenge warranting the attention of senior officials and oversight by our office. We are continuing to monitor and review selected aspects of the Department's progress in implementing core CAMS in all of its operating units. For example, we are completing an audit of computer security at the CAMS Support Center to determine whether the center is complying with the requirements of the Computer Security Act of 1987.  Major Challenges for the Department  Evaluate NTIS's Mission and Financial Viability In our last issue (See March 1999 issue, page 14), we discussed the need for the Department and the Technology Administration to develop a solution to the National Technical Information Service's longstanding financial problems. NTIS supports itself through fees charged for its products and services. In our September 1998 audit of NTIS's business operations, we reported that between FYs 1995 and 1998, the agency incurred a cumulative loss of $4.8 million. We concluded that if this trend continued as expected, NTIS would exhaust its retained earnings by the end of FY 1999 (see September 1998 issue, page 68). NTIS reported total revenues of $33.3 million for FY 1999, a reduction of $3.4 million from FY 1998. However, the agency was able to avert a loss, and actually report a surplus of $652,000 at the end of the year, by implementing several cost reduction measures. These measures included transferring some of its staff to other Commerce  7   IG's Message for the Congress agencies, consolidating office space, eliminating performance awards, and restricting travel.  Major Challenges for the Department  Nonetheless, a November 1998 consulting study commissioned by TA, at our recommendation, concluded that even with significant efforts to reduce costs and improve profitability, NTIS can no longer generate sufficient revenue to remain selfsupporting. We are also concerned that in order to compensate for lost revenue, NTIS must seek business opportunities on the perimeter of its statutory mission, where it risks competing against private businesses. NTIS's disappointing operating results raised questions not only about its ability to be selfsustaining, but also about the continuing need for a single federal clearinghouse for technical publications with the current structure and mission. NTIS's financial problems are just a symptom of a much larger problem--a steady decline in sales of its products and services caused by fundamental changes in the marketplace. Moreover, federal agencies are increasingly bypassing NTIS as a distribution channel, instead offering their publications directly to the public over the Internet. To address the primary issues and concerns related to the short- and long-term operations of NTIS, a working group made up of senior managers from the Department and TA was formed to consider options for taking corrective actions. Based on the group's efforts, the Department has drafted legislation that, if passed by the Congress and signed by the President, would close NTIS by the end of FY 2000; transfer its collection of scientific, technical, and engineering publications to the Library of Congress; and ensure permanent public access to such publications. We will continue to monitor the Department's and TA's efforts to address this important Commerce challenge.  Expand Private Sector Participation in NOAA's Marine and Aeronautical Data Gathering Since 1992, we have monitored and reported on NOAA's approach to acquiring marine and aeronautical data to support its programs. In a number of reports, we pointed out that NOAA could achieve greater economy, efficiency, and effectiveness by increasing private sector participation in its marine and aeronautical data gathering efforts. Marine Data While NOAA has made progress in expanding private sector participation in acquiring hydrographic data, we remain concerned about its emphasis on designing, owning, and operating four new fishery research vessels to meet some of its fisheries data collection needs, from FY 2000 through FY 2003, without thoroughly assessing and aggressively pursuing other alternatives. As we have said many times before, we believe NOAA should not focus its efforts on designing, owning, maintaining, or operating ships (see, for example, our March 1996 issue, page 43). Instead, NOAA should clearly articulate its program needs for ship services to the private sector, academia, and other government ship operators, with the goal of identifying modern, more cost-effective platforms for its data collection needs. NOAA has prepared a detailed data acquisition plan for its fisheries mission, which outlines its approach for acquiring the four fishery research vessels. Funding for one vessel has been approved by the Congress; however, NOAA's plan does not address the very real possibility that the bureau will not receive follow-on funding for the remaining vessels in FYs 2001-2003. Nor does it indicate how the data needed by the various fisheries programs  8  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress would be collected if the additional vessels are not acquired. The absence of such a contingency plan puts NOAA's fisheries programs at serious risk. NOAA's challenge is to thoroughly assess viable alternative approaches instead of relying so heavily on its in-house fleet. Aeronautical Data Since its establishment in 1983, NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, now located at MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, has been responsible for gathering atmospheric, oceanographic, and other data for such programs as hurricane and major storm research, nautical and aeronautical charting, climate and global change, and snow and aerial surveys. As NOAA's major flight operations group, the center operates a fleet of 14 aircraft, composed of 2 heavy craft, 1 mid-size jet, 8 light fixed-wing aircraft, and 3 helicopters. In December 1996, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency reviewed the management of the federal civilian aircraft fleet, including NOAA's, and found that it cost the government in excess of $1 billion annually to operate its aircraft programs. Additional studies of operational efficiencies, commissioned by the General Services Administration, reported opportunities to reduce costs by $92 million annually if most agencies consolidated their operations and entered into sharing arrangements. We conducted an audit of NOAA's light aircraft fleet to determine whether outsourcing is more costeffective than in-house operation in meeting the bureau's aircraft requirements (see September 1998 issue, page 44). Our audit concluded that the full inhouse cost of operating NOAA's light fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters averaged 42 percent more than the cost to operate similar aircraft in the private sector. In FY 1996, NOAA and interagency programs spent an additional $1.9 million to operate the bureau's in-house aircraft as compared to private sector costs. We recommended that NOAA privatize its light aircraft operations.  Major Challenges for the Department  NOAA disagrees with our position and believes that cost data it has collected indicates that its light aircraft are cost competitive and that no funds would be saved by using other sources to meet its data collection needs. NOAA has since engaged a consultant to conduct an analysis regarding the light aircraft. Reportedly, the consultant's analysis will include a review of NOAA light aircraft costs and the costs to contract for similar private-sector aircraft. NOAA's challenge is to identify and thoroughly assess the best ways to collect its aeronautical data.  Manage PTO's Space Requirements and Lease Costs The Patent and Trademark Office's space consolidation project continues to be a major challenge for the agency as it contends with the need to reinvent its business processes to make them more efficient and effective. PTO's project is expected to be one of the largest real estate ventures that the federal government will undertake in the next decade. This fact, coupled with the intense interest by the many diverse parties concerned with various aspects of the project's planning and development, makes getting it completed a special challenge. On behalf of PTO, GSA will award a contract to a private developer to construct a new facility or renovate an existing one and lease it back to PTO for at least 20 years with the option to buy. The solicitation calls for the construction of the building shell, to include basic electrical and mechanical systems, with the interior to be ""built out"" later. The project has been delayed almost a full year because it has been challenged in two separate federal court actions. GSA and PTO are contesting these challenges and hope to award the lease development contract by December 1999, with occupancy of the new building to begin in the summer of 2003.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  9   IG's Message for the Congress Given the size and importance of the planned PTO consolidation project, we conducted a review of the project in 1998 to determine whether (1) the project was justified and (2) PTO was effectively managing the project's critical acquisition phase (see March 1998 issue, page 54). The review concluded that the project was justified and should continue. We also found that PTO was managing many aspects of the lease/development procurement well. However, we expressed several concerns about PTO's management and planning for this major procurement. For example, PTO had failed to finalize its space requirements or reach agreement with one of its major unions concerning working conditions related to space requirements in a timely manner. In addition, we expressed concern about the lack of a contractual cost ceiling on the build-out. Also, in determining its space requirements, PTO had failed to factor in potential savings and efficiencies gained from systems reengineering and automation. PTO has responded favorably to all but two of our recommendations and has incorporated plans for addressing them into its planning and management of this project. Initially, PTO did not agree with establishing a contractual ceiling for the build-out. However, this is no longer an issue, as the October 9, 1998, solicitation for offer placed a cap of $29 million on the above standard build-out cost. PTO also disagreed with our recommendation that related to potential savings and efficiencies gained from systems engineering and automation. Last year the then Acting Inspector General testified before the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on our review of the project. He noted that although some of our recommendations had not yet been fully addressed by PTO, we were satisfied that this project should continue. We still hold this view and believe that continuing management attention and OIG oversight will be needed to ensure that the project is 10 completed in a timely, cost-effective manner within the cost limits prescribed by the Congress.  Major Challenges for the Department  Maximize Competition in the Department's Financial Assistance Programs In our last issue (see March 1999 issue, page 6), we discussed our ongoing review of the criteria, procedures, and practices used to make funding decisions under the Department's discretionary financial assistance programs. Our review is being conducted at the request of the Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, who made similar requests of the OIGs of the Department of Transportation and the National Science Foundation. The Chairman asked that we examine the criteria developed, statutorily or administratively, to guide Commerce officials in making discretionary awards, as well as the extent to which such criteria were appropriately applied. Discretionary financial assistance programs involve a significant portion of the Department's budget and operations. Six Commerce agencies and the Office of the Secretary administer 72 programs that provide a total of about $1 billion a year to state and local governments, educational institutions, other organizations, and individuals. Our review is focusing on the FY 1997 award criteria, procedures, and practices of 33 programs we have classified as ""full discretion"" programs. For the purpose of our review, full discretion programs are those programs whose authorizing legislation places no significant limitations on the Department's ability to independently determine the recipients or funding levels of the awards made under the programs. These programs accounted for more than 1,700 awards and $802 million in FY 1997 funding. We have completed audits and issued reports on 22 of the 33 Commerce programs to date. These programs represented 703 awards and $382 million Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress in 1997 funding. Of these programs, 10 are administered by NOAA, 4 by NIST, 2 by MBDA, 2 by NTIA, 2 by ITA, 1 by EDA, and 1 by the Office of the Secretary. We found that 13 of the 22 programs were administered in accordance with the Department's guidelines for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting financial assistance applications for funding. We did, however, identify opportunities for improvement in specific aspects of the various awards processes. Several of the programs could enhance the integrity of their procedures or bring more discipline to the award process by adopting the following practices: l l  We expect to issue final reports on the remaining 11 financial assistance programs during the next semiannual reporting period. Upon completing the audits, we plan to issue a capping report summarizing the results of the individual audits, identifying cross-cutting issues, and providing recommendations to the Department for improvement. Based on the work to date, we are encouraged by the Department's and bureaus' positive responses and immediate actions on our recommendations.  Major Challenges for the Department  Expanding proposal solicitation efforts. Including outside participants as proposal reviewers to increase the objectivity of the selection process. Adequately documenting justifications for deviations from review panel recommendations.  Continue to Improve the Department's Strategic Planning and Performance Measurement in Accordance with GPRA Despite the many inherent challenges in determining how to best plan and measure its performance in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Department has made progress in meeting this challenge during FY 1999. The Department submitted its second annual performance plan, for FY 2000, to OMB and the Congress in February 1999. The Congress, the General Accounting Office, and we agreed that, while the FY 2000 plan was significantly better than the FY 1999 plan, there was room for additional improvement. Of particular concern was the need for the Department to ensure that the data to be used in measuring performance is accurate, complete, and reliable. While the 2000 plan discussed the methods the Department will use in the verification of performance data, the extent to which the performance information can be relied on remains unclear. We have regularly provided advice and assistance to the Department on implementing GPRA. We have made several presentations on the need to improve the credibility of reported performance data, and have also focused attention on the linkage between the reporting of financial and performance information. 11  l  The other nine programs we reviewed, eight NOAA programs and one Office of the Secretary program, made awards on a sole source basis without using competitive selection procedures. We have recommended that NOAA and the Office of the Secretary ensure that financial assistance awards are made through a competitive process, unless otherwise mandated by law or adequately justified. We are pleased to report that NOAA agrees that more awards should be granted competitively for all discretionary funding programs and that a rigorous solicitation process should be used. The bureau is continuing to look at its current processes and has provided an audit resolution proposal, which we are assessing. We are also pleased to report that the Office of the Secretary converted its program to one that is competitive in FY 1998. Summaries of the seven reports issued during this period are in the agency overviews. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress During the audit of the Department's FY 1998 financial statements, we found that the process used by the Department to develop its statement of net cost and overview could be strengthened by improving communication and coordination between the offices for strategic planning and financial reporting. The overview, which identifies the Department's most significant performance measures, and the statement of net cost, which identifies the costs to achieve the results, link financial and performance reporting. We worked with the strategic planning office and financial reporting office in their efforts to identify the Department's most important measures and to implement a format for the statement of net cost that effectively reflects the Department's activities. Based upon comments received from the bureaus, modifications were made to the proposed statement and measures planned to be reported. This effort was essential because the Department plans to submit its first accountability report for FY 1999. FY 2000 will be a challenging year as the Department revises its strategic plan, prepares its initial program performance report, and submits its third annual performance plan. We will continue to look at the Department's efforts to implement GPRA, provide advisory comments regarding GPRA documents, and, where resources permit, perform targeted reviews. Moreover, we will ensure that there is consistency between the Department's financial and performance reporting.  Major Challenges for the Department  12  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress  OTHER ISSUES OF CONCERN Interagency and Other Special Agreements The Department of Commerce relies heavily on interagency and other special agreements in carrying out its mission. For example, in FY 1997, Commerce had more than 4,700 agreements, involving approximately $1.1 billion in funds received for reimbursable activities or obligated to acquire goods or services from other parties. These agreements can be between Commerce entities or between one Commerce unit and another federal agency, a state or local government agency, an educational institution, a not-for-profit organization, or a private party. Although agreements involve a significant amount of federal resources, they are not subject to the same controls and oversight as contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements. During this semiannual period, we issued the last 2 reports, in a series of 10, covering our reviews of Commerce units' agreements. These last two reports cover the Patent and Trademark Office and the National Technical Information Service (see pages 61 and 64). We are pleased to note that during this semiannual period, several of the most important recommendations made in one of the first reports in this series, the one covering the Office of the Secretary (see September 1998 issue, page 72), are being acted upon by the Department. Specifically, we recommended that the Department prepare formal policies and procedures covering agreements and develop a database to track agreements. The Department is now developing Commerce-wide agreements guidance, in the form of a handbook, which is being reviewed by the various bureaus, and is seeking to identify in-house resources for the development of the database. It is hoped that once the Department's handbook and database are fully implemented, many of the problems we identified with agreements will be fixed. Following are some of our observations from the 10 reports issued to date: l  Most agreements reviewed appeared to serve important and appropriate functions. Also, we are pleased to note that the Department and some individual bureaus are improving their processes for preparing and monitoring agreements. Some bureaus have improperly entered into informal arrangements without the benefit of a written agreement. Agreements have sometimes been used when a traditional procurement contract would have been more appropriate. Agreements have sometimes been used when financial assistance awards would have been preferable. Bureaus generally do not adequately track and control agreements. Some bureaus need to improve their systems and procedures to better ensure full cost recovery under reimbursable agreements.  l  l  l  l l  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  13   IG's Message for the Congress In the near future, we will issue a capping report that will identify several cross-cutting issues found during our Department-wide review of agreements. In this report, we will also draw upon work related to agreements that was done as part of earlier OIG reviews. In addition to identifying common problems that the various Commerce bureaus have experienced in preparing and administering agreements, we will highlight several ""best practices"" for bureaus and line offices to consider adopting.  Export Controls for Dual-Use Commodities The United States controls the export of certain goods and technologies for national security and foreign policy (including nonproliferation) purposes. Given the importance of export licensing and enforcement of export controls to national security, we have devoted considerable attention to the challenges facing the Bureau of Export Administration in issuing licenses authorizing the export of certain dual-use commodities. Dual-use commodities are goods and technologies that have both civilian and military uses. Controls over the export of dual-use commodities are a subject of continuing controversy, generating a wide range of opinions on how well the government's export control policies and practices balance the need to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests with the desire not to unduly hamper U.S. trade opportunities and competitiveness. Striking this balance poses a significant challenge for the parties involved, including BXA. In addition, BXA must administer these export controls in a world with increasingly porous borders. In prior years, we identified some weaknesses in BXA's controls over exports of biological agents (see September 1995 issue, page 23) and its effectiveness in conducting end-use checks and maintaining a watchlist to screen license applicants (see September 1997 issue, page 18). During this past year, we conducted a broad review of BXA's leadership role in the interagency export licensing process. In August 1999, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs asked us, along with the OIGs of the Departments of Defense, Energy, State, the Treasury, and the Central Intelligence Agency, to conduct an interagency review of the export licensing process for dual-use commodities and munitions. As part of this review, the OIGs followed up on findings and recommendations from a similar interagency review completed five years ago (see September 1993 issue, page 15). The review also examined the effectiveness of the Department of Commerce's current policies, procedures, and practices in its licensing of dual-use goods and technologies. In June 1999, each OIG issued a report on its agency's role in the licensing process (see page 17). The OIGs also issued a cross-cutting report that consolidated the findings and recommendations of all six reports. On June 23, 1999, the Commerce Acting Inspector General, along with the Inspectors General of the other five agencies, testified before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on the findings and recommendations from the review. We will continue to monitor BXA's efforts to improve export controls. As part of this effort, we will comply with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, which mandates that we, along with the OIGs of the other five agencies, conduct annual assessments for the next eight years on the adequacy of current export controls and counterintelligence measures to protect against the acquisition of U.S. technology and technical information by countries and entities of concern.  14  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   IG's Message for the Congress  RESOLUTION AND FOLLOW-UP The Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 require this report to present those audits issued before the beginning of the reporting period (April 1, 1999) for which no management decision had been made by the end of the period (September 30, 1999). The following table presents the overall status. Type of Audit Report Performance Financial Assistance Unresolved 9 1  Seven of the nine unresolved performance audits are audits of the awards processes of discretionary grant programs administered by NOAA. We are currently reviewing NOAA's action plan for these audits. The other two audits, both unresolved for more than a year, deal with the NMFS laboratory structure and NOAA's light aircraft operations. We are continuing to work with NOAA to explore alternative approaches to resolving these audits. (See page 54.) The unresolved financial assistance audit involves an EDA grant award. We did not agree with EDA's response to the final report and are awaiting a revised audit resolution proposal. (See page 23.) Department Administrative Order 213-5, ""Audit Resolution and Follow-up,"" provides procedures for management to request a modification to an approved audit action plan, or for a financial assistance recipient to appeal an audit resolution determination.

Dualuse commodities are goods and technologies determined to have both civilian and military uses. The review was done in response to the Committee Chairman's request that the six IGs look at the licensing process and update a similar interagency OIG review conducted in 1993 (see September 1993 issue, page 15). BXA administers the U.S. government's export licensing and enforcement system for dual-use commodities for national security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation reasons under the authority of several laws, including the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. Although that statute expired in September 1990, export regulations promulgated under the act remain in effect by executive order. Our review found the licensing of U.S. dual-use exports to be an improved multi-agency review process that attempts to bring divergent policy views and information to bear on license decision-making. We also concluded that the interagency referral and escalation processes for export license applications are working reasonably well. There are four levels of escalation for dual-use cases: the Operating Committee at the senior civil service level, the Advisory Committee on Export Policy at the assistant secretary level, the Export Administration Review Board at the Cabinet level, and the President. We noted significant improvement in several aspects of BXA's review of license applications and issuance of licenses since 1993. However, we also found a number of problems that warrant the attention of BXA, the Department, the Administration, and the Congress. Our observations were as follows: l The Bureau of Export Administration is primarily responsible for the administration and enforcement of the nation's system for controlling exports of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. Under the Export Administration Act and regulations, BXA's major functions include formulating and implementing export control policy; processing export license applications; conducting various policy, technical, and economic analyses; promulgating regulations; conducting industry outreach; and enforcing the act and regulations. Export Administration implements U.S. export control and nonproliferation laws and policies through export licensing, commodity classifications, and advisory opinions; technical, economic, foreign availability, and policy analyses; promulgation of regulations; and industry outreach. It also conducts various defense industry base activities. Export Enforcement participates in reviews of export license applications and conducts criminal and administrative investigations of the export control portions of the Export Administration Act and regulations. It also administers and enforces the antiboycott provisions of the act and regulations.  Current export control legislative authority and regulations need attention. New legislative authority is needed to replace the expired Export Administration Act and accurately reflect current export control policies. In addition, export control policies and regulations covering the release of technology to foreign nationals--referred to as ""deemed exports""--are ambiguous and need to be revised.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  17   Bureau of Export Administration l Bureau of Export Administration  Export Administration  Export Enforcement  More transparency is needed in the commodity classification process. Although BXA has instituted a front-end review mechanism to pre-screen exporters' requests for commodity classifications, BXA's processing of these requests is often not timely, resulting in delays for exporters. In addition, BXA needs to work with both Defense and State to develop specific criteria and procedures for referring munitions-related commodity classifications to those agencies. The documentation on initial analyses of export applications should be enhanced. It was difficult to determine whether some license applications were being thoroughly analyzed by BXA licensing officers in the initial review period because there was little documentation as to how the officers reached their conclusions. Better policies and procedures, as well as additional training, could enhance officers' documentation of their analyses of applications. The export license application review process has improved. The 1993 multi-OIG review pointed out that there was not complete accord between Commerce and most of the other federal agencies regarding license application referrals. Since that time, BXA has made improvements in the process for referring export license applications to other agencies. In FY 1998, BXA referred 85 percent of export license applications to other agencies for review, up from 53 percent in fiscal year 1993.  l  l  Percentage of Export License Applications Referred to Other Agencies 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0%  91% 77% 53% 54% 51%  85%  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998  White text 18  Fiscal Years  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Bureau of Export Administration l  Weaknesses in the review process need to be addressed. While the overall referral process is effective, action is needed to ensure that (1) licenses are not amended without interagency review, (2) adequate review time is provided to the Central Intelligence Agency for its end user checks, (3) a mechanism is established to better track and assess the cumulative effect of dual-use exports to a specific country or region, and (4) all parties to pending license applications are screened against a major law enforcement database maintained by the Treasury Department. Dispute resolution process gives referral agencies a meaningful opportunity to escalate license applications. From fiscal years 1991 to 1998, the number of cases escalated to the Operating Committee increased by 353 percent, while the number escalated to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy decreased by 62 percent. In addition, only one case has been escalated to the Export Administration Review Board since 1991. The fact that there have been significantly more cases escalated to the Operating Committee, and many fewer escalated to higher levels, indicates that this process is working well. BXA has sought interagency guidance during review of exporter appeals, but a more formal process is needed. Once an export license application has been denied, the exporter has the right to appeal to BXA, whose decision is considered final. Although BXA informally confers with the referral agencies on appeals, we believe that a formal process should be developed to include these agencies in the appeals process. BXA needs to improve its monitoring of license conditions with reporting requirements. The ability to place conditions on a license is an important part of the license resolution process, as well as an additional means to monitor certain shipments. The 1993 interagency OIG review reported that BXA was not adequately monitoring license conditions. We found that this problem still exists. End use checks are a valuable tool, but some improvements are needed. End use checks, an important part of the license evaluation process, are used to verify the legitimacy of export transactions controlled by BXA and help prevent and detect illegal technology transfer. Many of these checks are conducted by Commerce's U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) officers stationed at overseas diplomatic posts; other checks are conducted by BXA special agents during overseas ""safeguard"" 19  l  l  l  l  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Bureau of Export Administration visits to foreign companies. We identified concerns with US&FCS's and BXA's end use checks, including checks not done within established time frames, the use of non-American personnel to conduct some checks, the failure to perform on-site visits, and insufficient coordination with other embassy offices and host governments. l  BXA needs a new automated export licensing system. BXA's Export Control Automated Support System, developed in 1984, provides license processing and historical license information to BXA and the referral agencies. While BXA's export licensing process has become more effective in recent years, its automated system is lagging far behind. We strongly agree with BXA that it needs a new system to process export license applications efficiently and effectively.  BXA generally agreed with most of our observations and recommendations. However, the bureau stated that some of the recommended changes to its current practices do not have obvious benefits or may be difficult to implement. In addition, BXA stated that virtually none of our recommendations include any assessment of the budgetary impact. With the exception of our recommendation that BXA develop a new automated licensing system, we are not convinced that implementing our recommendations would require substantial budget increases. We also contend that all of our recommendations have the clear benefit of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the export licensing process. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-11488)  20  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Economic Development Administration Research and Evaluation Program Funding Decisions Should Be Documented As part of its Department-wide review of Commerce's discretionary financial assistance programs, the OIG conducted an audit of the FY 1997 criteria, procedures, and practices for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting preliminary and full proposals for financial assistance under EDA's Research and Evaluation Program. Discretionary financial assistance programs are those programs for which federal agencies have the authority to independently determine the recipients and funding levels of awards. Through the Research and Evaluation Program, EDA provides financial assistance to individuals and organizations for the conduct of economic development research to help (1) determine the causes of unemployment, underemployment, underdevelopment, and chronic depression in the nation, and (2) formulate and implement national, state, and local programs to raise income levels and otherwise produce solutions to the problems resulting from those conditions. During FY 1997, the program awarded five grants, totaling $603,000. Based on our review, we found that there was insufficient documentation of EDA's award procedures and practices to determine whether they supported merit-based decisions and complied with federal and departmental guidance. Specifically, we found that: l The Economic Development Administration was established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, including the comprehensive amendments by the Economic Development Administration Reform Act of 1998, to generate new jobs, help protect existing jobs, and stimulate commercial and industrial growth in economically distressed areas of the United States. EDA does this by providing grants to public and private nonprofit organizations in communities with problems that are stifling economic growth; planning grants to states, cities, districts, and Indian reservations; special economic adjustment assistance to states and local governments with recent, severe problems or long-term economic deterioration; technical assistance to communities to build organizational capacity and solve specific economic development problems; and research and evaluation grants to increase knowledge about effective economic development tools.  EDA developed criteria consistent with program objectives to evaluate proposals and applications for awards, but failed to document its application of these criteria. EDA published a solicitation notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of funding and soliciting program proposals and applications for awards and also publicized the program on its web site; however, the notice did not provide potential applicants with a clear description of the procedures to be used in reviewing and selecting applications for funding. EDA did not adequately document its procedures and practices for reviewing and selecting proposals and applications for awards.  l  l  We recommended that EDA ensure that procedures and practices for the solicitation, review, and selection of proposals and applications for Research and Evaluation Program awards support merit-based decisions by making sure that solicitation notices include all basic program information and that EDA's procedures and practices for the review and selection Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  21   Economic Development Administration of proposals and applications are properly documented. EDA agreed with our findings and recommendations. (Business and Trade Audits Division: BTD-11548-9-0001)  Economic Development Administration  Program Operations  Finance and Administration Cong. Liaison, Program Research and Evaluation  Midwestern Flood Grantee Had Inadequate Financial Management System In August 1997, EDA awarded two grants to a nonprofit organization in a Midwestern city to alleviate the effects of an April 1997 flood that crippled the city. The flood forced nearly 90 percent of the city's residents to evacuate the area for several days and damaged numerous homes and businesses. Total disaster losses to the city were estimated at $1.8 billion. The organization, a regional resource for economic development initiatives that operates under the city's job development authority, uses federal grant funds to award loans and grants, and make equity investments in regional business ventures. One EDA grant of about $2.2 million was awarded to establish a revolving loan fund (RLF) to provide loans to the city's small businesses. The second grant of nearly $6.9 million was awarded to construct a building to house businesses damaged by the flood. An OIG interim financial audit of costs claimed under the two awards found that the organization's accounting and financial management system did not comply with federal regulations, EDA requirements, or award terms and conditions. The deficiencies included the incorrect calculation of RLF income, an inadequate financial management system, failure to submit a program income reutilization plan, inadequate project inspection procedures, and unapproved project change orders. We recommended that EDA direct the organization to correct the RLF income calculation, improve its financial management record-keeping, prepare a program income reutilization plan for EDA's approval, reinspect the building, and obtain EDA approval for all unapproved change orders. The organization and EDA took actions that complied with our recommendations. (Denver Regional Office of Audits: DEN-11625-9-0001)  Lease Agreement Reached Under Flood Grant Project Appears Deficient As part of an earlier review of EDA's Midwest Flood Program (see September 1998 issue, page 19), we conducted examinations of individual grant recipients, including a Missouri city and its co-recipient, a for-profit firm. EDA awarded a grant to construct a city-owned facility to replace a 22 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Economic Development Administration manufacturing plant that had been destroyed during the Midwest floods of 1993. Total funding for the project included approximately $2 million from EDA and about $1 million from the grantees. Upon completion, the facility was leased to a for-profit company. During our review, we found several deficiencies in the lease agreement between the city and the for-profit company, including (1) lease rates that appeared to be much lower than fair market rental rates for the facility, (2) lease terms that allowed the transfer of the facility to the forprofit company after the term of the 20-year EDA mortgage for less than adequate consideration, and (3) lack of support for the 20-year life of the facility, which was used to set the length of the mortgage. Because of the generous terms of the lease, we were concerned that the transaction appeared to be a ""pass-through"" of EDA Title IX funds to a for-profit company, in violation of the Public Works and Economic Development Act. While the overall purpose of the project was met, we believed that EDA needed to ensure that the lease transaction meets agency requirements. We expressed our concerns to EDA in a May 7, 1999, memorandum. We are currently discussing with EDA officials the actions needed to correct the noted deficiencies. (Denver Regional Office of Audits)  Investigation in Brief Sentencing. In the March 1999 issue (page 29), we reported on the bribery conviction of a former economic development representative. The conviction resulted from a joint OIG/FBI/IRS investigation, which found that the official had accepted $3,000 from two individuals representing an applicant for EDA grant funds. In May 1999, he was sentenced in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to 36 months' probation, fined $20,000, and ordered to perform 150 hours of community service. (Denver Field Office of Investigations)  Audit Reports Unresolved for Over Six Months As of September 30, 1999, one financial assistance audit report, DEN10586-9-0001 (see March 1999 issue, page 28), had recommendations unresolved for more than six months. The report found that a nonprofit grantee in Texas had disregarded procurement standards in awarding a $244,250 contract to a consulting firm. The report also questioned $258,838 in salary costs and in-kind contributions because of inadequate supporting documentation. EDA did not agree with our findings, and we are awaiting the submission of a responsive audit resolution proposal. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  23   Economics and Statistics Administration The Economics and Statistics Administration analyzes economic developments, develops policy options, and produces a major share of U.S. government economic and demographic statistics. The Chief Economist monitors and analyzes economic developments and directs studies that have a bearing on the formulation of economic policy. ESA has two principal agencies: Bureau of the Census. Census is the country's preeminent statistical collection and dissemination agency. It publishes a wide variety of statistical data about people and the economy of the nation, conducting approximately 200 annual surveys, in addition to the decennial census of the U.S. population and the decennial census of industry. Bureau of Economic Analysis. BEA's goal is to provide a clear picture of the U.S. economy by preparing, developing, and interpreting the national income and product accounts (summarized by the gross domestic product), as well as aggregate measures of international, regional, and state economic activity.  Dress Rehearsal Quality Check Survey Indicates Improvements Needed for Decennial On April 1, 2000, the Census Bureau will begin conducting the decennial census of the nation's population for the purpose of congressional apportionment. Census data is also used for state and federal redistricting and allocating federal funds. Although the bureau attempts to count every resident during the census, some undercount of the population has occurred in all decennials. For 2000, the bureau plans to use a quality check survey in an attempt to more accurately estimate the population. Under this methodology, the direct enumeration and the subsequent quality check sample survey will be conducted independently. Although the Supreme Court determined that the Census Act bars the use of statistical sampling for apportionment purposes, the Court also wrote that the act requires the use of sampling, ""if feasible,"" for all other purposes. The bureau intends to provide statistically corrected numbers for non-apportionment purposes, based on its judgment that the corrected count will be more accurate. During the census, the bureau will begin the five major operational phases of the quality check survey (see facing page): (1) developing an independent listing for each housing unit in the sample, (2) conducting person interviews using laptop computers to gather and transmit census data for each unit, (3) conducting person matching to compare the results obtained during person interviews with the results obtained in the census, (4) attempting to resolve discrepancies from the person matching phase during person follow-up, and (5) performing the population estimation once sample data has been compared to census data. In 1998 the OIG conducted an audit to test quality check survey operations during the decennial dress rehearsal, whose purpose was to assess various operations and procedures to be used in the decennial. The dress rehearsal was conducted at three sites: (1) an 11-county area including the city of Columbia, South Carolina; (2) the city of Sacramento, California; and (3) the Menominee American Indian Reservation in Wisconsin. Our audit focused on person interview and person follow-up procedures in Columbia and Sacramento. We found several areas in which the bureau needs to make improvements in preparing for the decennial: l  The person follow-up phase encountered significant delays because the bureau was unable to provide the data necessary for field operations to begin. As a result, in trying to keep the quality check survey on schedule, bureau interviewers took shortcuts that we believe could degrade the accuracy of decennial results. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  24   Economics and Statistics Administration l  The bureau did not have procedures for person follow-up to deter enumerators from falsifying interviews or to detect those that may have occurred because it believed that such a process would be too complex to develop. However, this phase of the survey is particularly susceptible to falsified interviews because both direct enumeration data and quality check survey data are preprinted on the questionnaire. Therefore, we believe that the benefits of having such a process outweigh the challenges of developing it. Although the use of laptop computers during the person interview phase generally worked as intended, interviewers identified several problems related to the electronic transmission of person interview cases from their laptops to the headquarters computer server.

For example, software problems delayed the deployment of one report onto the laptops, while the design of another report did not meet user needs.  Among our recommendations were that the bureau (1) identify and resolve for the 2000 decennial the underlying causes of delayed person follow-up operations, and ensure that data collection procedures are followed by interviewers in the field, (2) develop a quality assurance plan for person follow-up that is designed to deter and detect enumeratorfalsified data in the 2000 decennial, (3) correct and operationally test the case check-in program and clearly communicate procedures for retransmitting cases, and (4) operationally test the performance reporting system before the 2000 decennial to ensure that correct and timely information is available to field managers. The bureau concurred with our recommendations. According to bureau officials, plans for the quality check survey now include prioritizing the workload so that the regional offices will receive large or difficult cases early in the person follow-up operation to allow more time to work on them. Bureau officials also state that a person follow-up quality assurance program has been developed to detect falsification and ensure that questionnaires have been completed properly and that information is legible and usable. (Economics and Statistics Audits Division: ESD11449-9-0001)  Multiple Response Resolution Improvements Needed for Accurate, Timely Census Processing To make it easier for people to be counted in the 2000 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau will allow households the option to respond in several ways. In addition to collecting data through its traditional methods of mailed questionnaires and in-person interviews, the bureau will allow the public to respond by using forms available in public places, by telephone, or over the Internet. While multiple response methods increase the chances that people will be counted, they also increase the likelihood of receiving more than one 26 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Economics and Statistics Administration response from a given housing unit, with some responses including the same people. The bureau has devised procedures to count individuals at each address and has automated this process, called multiple response resolution (MRR). When multiple responses are received, MRR is supposed to include people at an address who resided there on Census Day, April 1, 2000, and omit people who did not or who were already counted from another response for that housing unit. The OIG conducted an evaluation to determine whether MRR is likely to resolve multiple responses correctly--and in the allotted time--during the decennial. We observed the bureau's preparations for using MRR during the 1998 Dress Rehearsal and reviewed results from its processing of dress rehearsal response data. The bureau's ""report card"" on the dress rehearsal asserted nearly perfect accuracy rates for MRR. However, the report card calculated MRR errors in terms of the total enumeration, rather than the households that submitted multiple responses. For example, although the report card for MRR in Sacramento showed an error rate of only 0.3 percent based on total enumeration, the error rate based on a calculation of MRR's success in resolving multiple responses was 9 percent--30 times as high. In reporting on future performance, the bureau should identify MRR's accuracy in resolving multiple responses, as well as the impact of MRR errors on the total enumeration. We identified several conditions that diminished the accuracy of MRR results in the dress rehearsal. Problems with the questionnaire design, the way the public completed the questionnaire, and automated data capture in some cases caused inaccurate data to be sent for MRR processing. Moreover, the MRR software sometimes produced questionable results. MRR analysts are reviewing the dress rehearsal and evaluation data to determine what modifications are needed to the procedures and associated software for resolving multiple responses. In addition, we concluded that the bureau cannot ensure that the process is implemented correctly because it did not use a sufficiently structured approach in developing the MRR software. A more structured approach, using software engineering standards, would help ensure correct implementation of MRR. Software testing also needs to be expanded to address more diverse response data and ensure that MRR can reliably handle a wide array of potential input conditions. Finally, the bureau needs to make a coordinated effort to perform beginning-to-end testing of questionnaire data processing to ensure that the output from each step is accurate and can be input into the next step without error.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  27   Economics and Statistics Administration We also found that, based on dress rehearsal results, MRR processing for the decennial census would require more than the 30-day period that the bureau has estimated to ensure the timely availability of data for follow-on processing operations. The bureau needs to obtain additional computing resources and modify the MRR software to reduce excessive processing time. To address these issues, important decisions concerning MRR requirements and design must be made and significant development and testing work accomplished. The bureau has acknowledged many of the issues addressed by our report and is analyzing the dress rehearsal data and working on improvements to MRR. In addition, it has made substantial improvements to the data capture system since the dress rehearsal. However, the bureau has not fully defined the activities needed to refine MRR and complete its development. We made several recommendations to assist the bureau in defining these activities and developing and implementing a plan for their completion. The bureau stated that it concurred with, or had already acted upon, most of our recommendations. After the report was issued, the bureau reported having taken several actions to simplify the process to reduce processing time. (Office of Systems Evaluation: OSE-10711)  Decennial Public Awareness Campaign Is Meeting Program Objectives Despite the importance of having accurate decennial census data, and the public's obligation to answer and return census forms, the Census Bureau has been confronted with a steady decline in the mail response rate. The portion of households that complete and mail back the census form was 75 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990. It is expected to decline to 61 percent in 2000. When households do not respond to the decennial, costs increase dramatically because the bureau must hire enumerators to contact each non-responding household to obtain the data. In 1990 the average cost of enumerating a household that mailed back a questionnaire was $2. But the cost quickly escalated to $12 when an enumerator had to contact the household, and approached $36 for households that required additional follow-up contacts. Despite the bureau's follow-up efforts, many households remain uncounted. In 1990 the estimated net undercount (the number of people undercounted minus the number overcounted) was about 4 million people. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  28   Economics and Statistics Administration Furthermore, the undercount was not equally distributed across all demographic groups, a factor called the differential undercount. For example, in 1990 the net undercount for the nation as a whole was 1.6 percent. However, the net undercount was 4.4 percent among African Americans, 5.0 percent among Hispanics, 2.3 percent among Pacific Islanders, and 12.2 percent among American Indians. To boost mail response rates for Census 2000, especially among historically undercounted groups, the bureau will undertake special public awareness efforts to reach every person. These efforts principally comprise two major activities: l  Conducting an advertising campaign aimed at increasing the mail response rate, including that of historically undercounted populations. For the first time, the campaign will incorporate paid television, radio, and print ads. Leveraging local knowledge and contacts by building partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments, community-based organizations, the media, and private-sector organizations.  l  The OIG conducted an audit of both activities involved in the bureau's public awareness campaign and, because the two activities have similar goals--increasing the mail response rate and reducing the undercount-- also evaluated the coordination between them. In October 1997, the bureau awarded a contract to an advertising firm to create and produce an extensive advertising campaign to inform and motivate the public to complete and return the census form. We believe that the development of the Census 2000 advertising message is supported by a sound methodology and that the contractor's actions effectively addressed the required objectives. The contractor hired subcontractors familiar with the groups that had been historically undercounted; performed research and extensive testing; and created a message aimed at getting people to respond by explaining how they benefit from the decennial. Moreover, the advertising firm presented the creative concepts to and actively sought feedback from many groups, including the bureau, the Department, the Census Advisory Committee, and the Congress. We also found that the partnership program was implementing a comprehensive, effective nationwide program directed at increasing the mail response rate and thereby reducing the undercount. To accomplish its goals, the program has coordinated extensively with its government, business, and community-based partners. As of mid-July, the bureau had secured nearly 22,000 partnerships. These partners are closely affiliated Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  29   Economics and Statistics Administration with the hard-to-count populations and should be instrumental in getting these groups to respond. The bureau has also implemented several initiatives to address a lack of coordination between the advertising campaign and the partnership program identified during the 1998 Dress Rehearsal. Based on our review, it appears that these initiatives will provide for sufficient coordination among the regions, the partnership program, and the Publicity Office. Whether the advertising campaign and partnership program will motivate households to participate by filling out and returning the questionnaire will only be known after the decennial is completed. To answer this question, the bureau is implementing plans to conduct postcensus evaluations of both activities. Given the unprecedented effort to increase mail response and reduce the differential undercount, we agree that it is imperative that the bureau evaluate these activities to decide whether they should be continued for 2010. Because our review revealed no significant problems, our report contained no recommendations. (Economics and Statistics Audits Division: ESD-11755-9-0001)  Methods of Archiving Decennial Data and Disposing of Questionnaires Need Finalizing During the 2000 Decennial Census, completed questionnaires received from households will be sent to data capture centers across the country for processing. To capture the data in a timely and efficient manner, the Census Bureau has awarded two contracts--the first for the development of a state-of-the-art system, Data Capture System 2000 (DCS 2000) (see March 1999 issue, page 30), and the second, a services contract to provide for the facilities, personnel, management, and equipment and supplies to perform data capture operations using DCS 2000. The bureau is responsible for ensuring that the data is secured and not improperly disclosed. At the request of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the OIG conducted an inspection to address concerns relating to the ownership of the completed questionnaires and the adequacy of the questionnaire disposal and inspection provisions. In examining the services contract and related Census documents, we found that ownership of the completed questionnaires appropriately remains with the bureau, and that the provisions for government inspections to ensure proper disposal of the questionnaires are adequate. We also Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  30   Economics and Statistics Administration found, however, that the bureau has not yet finalized its plans and procedures for questionnaire retention and disposal and cannot do so until a method has been identified for archiving the data that is acceptable to the National Archives and Records Administration. An agreement on archiving is needed before Archives will authorize destruction of the questionnaires and approve a destruction schedule. We recommended that the bureau: l  Develop an archiving proposal for 2000 decennial data and begin discussing the proposal with Archives within 30 days. After reaching agreement with Archives on a questionnaire destruction schedule, incorporate relevant portions of the plan and procedures concerning the retention and disposal of completed questionnaires into the services contract. Immediately formalize its plan and procedures for the retention, use, and disposal of dress rehearsal questionnaires and incorporate the contractor's responsibilities into the DCS 2000 contract.  l  l  The bureau agreed to implement our recommendations. (Office of Systems Evaluation: OSE-10758)  Allegations Made by Census Employee Against Supervisor Were Not Substantiated In response to a congressional inquiry regarding allegations made by a temporary Census Bureau field office employee against a supervisor, the OIG conducted a review to determine the validity of the claims. The employee alleged that during the block canvassing operation, conducted to verify mailing addresses in preparation for the 2000 Decennial Census, (1) data submitted was false and inaccurate because data pages were removed, unsupported changes were made, and data was submitted under the accuser's name without the required quality assurance procedures being completed; (2) employees were denied reimbursement for overtime worked and mileage driven; and (3) employees were treated with disrespect by being publicly humiliated by the supervisor. We reached the following conclusions about the three allegations: l  Regarding the allegation of inaccurate data, we examined the bureau's data quality assurance procedures, which allow data to be corrected and revised at several stages during the block canvassing operation, and concluded that the procedures had been followed. 31  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Economics and Statistics Administration Because the bureau has the experience, knowledge, and program responsibilities to provide accurate data, we referred the specific allegation about inaccurate data to the bureau, asking it to advise us of the results of its inquiry. l  The allegation that employees were denied reimbursement for overtime and mileage was not substantiated. Overtime was neither requested by the employees nor authorized by local census office officials for the block canvassing operation, and employees were reimbursed for all mileage claimed. Due to the lack of objective documentary evidence and the inconsistent accounts of persons involved, we could neither confirm nor disprove the allegation that employees were treated in a disrespectful manner. (Seattle Regional Office of Audits)  l  Preliminary Work Identifies Concerns with Decennial Leasing Operations During our ongoing review of the bureau's efforts to lease office space for the 2000 Decennial, several issues came to our attention that warranted immediate management attention. Rather than wait until the issuance of a formal report, we informed the bureau of our preliminary observations in an interim memorandum so that it could achieve cost savings and other benefits during later phases of the decennial leasing operation. Among the issues we identified were (1) concerns about the proposed Census Bureau-General Services Administration memorandum of understanding for the second phase of leasing, (2) potentially significant cost savings on leased space build-out, (3) the oversupply of materials and office supplies for block canvassing at certain locations, and (4) persistent problems with some local census office telephone systems. A fifth issue of concern was that many leases from the initial phase of local office openings were awarded without adequate competition. This lack of competition resulted from the fact that the delineated geographic areas within which offices could be located were too narrowly drawn, which limited the number of lessors who could bid on the leases. As a result, the leases for many sites were more expensive than anticipated, and the bureau lost time in re-competing some leases. However, we have noted a concerted effort by the bureau to broaden its delineated areas in the latter phases of the lease acquisitions, a strategy that has resulted in greater competition. The bureau also said it would address the other issues we brought to its attention. Our final report will discuss the bureau's actions on these matters. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations) 32 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   International Trade Administration Inspector General Testifies on Progress of U.S. Export Assistance Center Network On September 9, 1999, the Inspector General testified before the House Small Business Subcommittee on Tax, Finance, and Exports on the OIG's work related to U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs). US&FCS operates a ""hub and spoke"" network consisting of 19 USEACs connecting 86 smaller Export Assistance Centers. The USEACs, the hubs of the network, are ""one-stop shops"" where US&FCS, along with the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), bring together federal, state, and local government and private sector expertise to better assist U.S. exporters. The IG's conclusions were essentially the same as those reported three years earlier in an OIG assessment of the development and rollout of the USEACs (see March 1996 issue, page 33)--namely, that although problems remain, the USEACs are demonstrating their ability to meet the needs of U.S. exporters. His conclusions were based on the progress the centers have made in demonstrating that federal agencies can work together to provide export assistance much better than under the previous fragmented approach. The IG's observations, discussed in the following sections, were derived from a series of OIG audits, evaluations, inspections, and followup work that included visits to the centers depicted below: The International Trade Administration is responsible for most nonagricultural U.S. trade issues and works with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in coordinating U.S. trade policy. ITA has four principal units: Market Access and Compliance. MAC develops and implements international economic policies of a bilateral, multilateral, or regional nature. Its main objectives are to obtain market access for American firms and workers and to achieve full compliance by foreign nations with trade agreements signed with the United States. Trade Development. TD advises on international trade and investment policies pertaining to U.S. industrial sectors, carries out programs to strengthen domestic export competitiveness, and promotes U.S. industry's increased participation in international markets. Import Administration. IA defends American industry against injurious and unfair trade practices by administering the antidumping and countervailing duty laws of the United States, and enforcing other trade laws and agreements negotiated to address such trade practices. U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service. US&FCS promotes the exports of U.S. companies and helps small and medium-sized businesses market their goods and services abroad.

More often than not, the collocation of export promotion and trade finance partners in the USEACs fosters closer working ties and strengthens information exchanges, resulting in improved export marketing and export finance assistance to small and medium-sized U.S. businesses. Staffing at some USEACs remains a concern. While SBA has at least one representative in every USEAC, Ex-Im Bank has staff physically located in only four USEACs. Ex-Im Bank officials emphasize that they have city/state partners in the vicinity of many EACs serving as authorized agents for Ex-Im Bank products and services; however, the ability and commitment of such partners have been questioned by USEAC staff and other stakeholders. USEACs need a better system for identifying, measuring, and reporting programmatic accomplishments. Currently, each of the three partner agencies assesses its performance only as an individual part of the USEACs; for example, US&FCS tracks export actions. We encouraged the development of additional performance criteria, such as joint counseling sessions and mutually beneficial outreach activities, that view the USEAC as a single entity. The USEAC network is fostering stronger partner relationships with state and local trade organizations. Some USEACs have already gone beyond being simply a federal partnership by also sharing resources with state and local export promotion organizations. These state and local partnerships have allowed some duplicative programs to be eliminated, while enhancing the quality and delivery of export assistance services to U.S. businesses. Coordination between the USEACs and US&FCS's overseas posts could be better. Cooperation has been spotty and too often dependent on the commitment of the individual staff at Export Assistance Centers and overseas posts. Specifically, our reviews have confirmed cases where US&FCS posts either were not timely in providing important products and services that USEAC clients were waiting for or provided products and services of inferior quality. US&FCS is working to remedy this situation through initiatives designed to increase teamwork among its trade specialists and help its domestic and overseas staff better understand each other's functions. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  l Trade Development U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service  l  l  l  34   International Trade Administration l  Marketing of centers' products and services should be improved. According to representatives of some of the federal, local, state, and private trade organizations we spoke with, inadequate marketing is one of the biggest hindrances to delivering valuable USEAC services to U.S. exporters. Some believe that the USEACs are not effectively getting out the message of who they are, where they are, what they do, and what products and services they have to offer.  The IG concluded by expressing his optimism about the future of the USEACs and their potential to continue to improve their effectiveness in helping to meet the export promotion and trade finance needs of U.S. exporters.  OIG Continues Its Overseas Work with Reviews of Three US&FCS Posts During this semiannual period, the OIG continued its reviews of Commerce overseas posts (see September 1998 issue, page 35, and March 1999 issue, page 40), which are under the direction of ITA's U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. The reviews are designed to evaluate the posts' operational effectiveness and determine whether they are efficiently accomplishing their mission of providing U.S. companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, with export assistance. In the following sections, we summarize the reports of the three inspections of the posts we issued during this semiannual period--China, Brazil, and South Africa. China The People's Republic of China is the United States' fourth largest trading partner. From 1992 to 1998, U.S. exports to China increased by more than 90 percent, growing from $7.5 billion to $14.3 billion. However, because China's exports to the United States have grown even faster, the U.S. trade deficit with China reached $57 billion in 1998. Although trade barriers still exist in the areas of tariffs, market access, standards, and intellectual property rights, China, with a population of 1.3 billion, is a market with enormous potential for U.S. companies. Recognizing the importance of China to overall U.S. trade relations, ITA has focused a great deal of attention on this emerging market. From 1996 to 1998, US&FCS increased its operations and administrative budget for China by over 50 percent--from $2.3 million to $3.6 million. In addition to carrying out its core trade promotion duties, US&FCS China has assisted many other U.S. government agencies, Members of Congress, Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  35   International Trade Administration and state delegations that have traveled to China to deal with a variety of trade policy and promotion issues. In addition to hosting a steady stream of visitors, US&FCS China has counseled many U.S. businesses and provided a wide range of services, including handling trade disputes and organizing trade events to meet U.S. companies' needs. The OIG's inspection of US&FCS's operations in China involved visits to all five constituent posts: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenyang. We found that clients gave US&FCS China's staff high marks for their ability to handle multiple trade issues, their knowledge of the market, and their willingness to assist U.S. businesses. However, we also found problems that warrant management's attention: l  The quality of some products needs to be improved. U.S. business clients were generally satisfied with the services provided by US&FCS, especially the export counseling sessions and trade advocacy efforts. The production and timeliness of market research products have increased, but the quality and consistency of reporting among the five posts should be improved. US&FCS's services designed to help U.S. exporters identify business leads and contacts received mixed reviews. Clients who purchased the Gold Key Service, a tailored mix of orientation briefings, market research, and appointments with potential partners, were generally pleased, although some pointed out the need for better targeting and prescreening of companies. Clients who purchased the Agent/Distributor Service, a customized overseas search for qualified agents, distributors, and representatives for U.S. firms, rated this service the lowest due to cancellations by the post, poor targeting of potential companies, and long delivery times. The post was taking steps to improve this service.  l  Export control checks warrant continued monitoring. In addition to trade promotion activities, US&FCS China also fulfills its export control responsibilities to the extent that the Chinese authorities permit pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications. We noted that some scheduled pre-license checks had been canceled by the authorities. The United States was granted permission to conduct post-shipment verifications after our inspection, but this is an area we continue to monitor as part of our interagency review of the export licensing process (see page 17). Management should address US&FCS China's needs . Despite the importance of China to U.S. trade relations, ITA had left the deputy senior commercial officer position vacant for over Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  l  36   International Trade Administration 15 months. As a result, the senior commercial officer--who was on his first posting in that capacity--had to juggle many responsibilities and delegate others to inexperienced officers. Without a deputy, he also had insufficient time to devote to managing internal operations and building a strong, integrated country program. Consequently, the five constituent posts were not working effectively together, and many financial and administrative responsibilities had been neglected. Moreover, US&FCS management in Washington had neither provided sufficient guidance on building a strong export promotion program nor developed a regional plan for dealing with the Asian financial crisis. l  Longstanding problems in financial operations need to be resolved. US&FCS's financial operations were troublesome due to inexperienced staff, a lack of management emphasis on monitoring and managing funds, and problems in the Beijing Embassy's budget and fiscal office and the consulates' cashier operations. US&FCS China could not rely on the financial reports produced by the budget and fiscal office because they did not accurately depict the post's financial status; delays in that office's processing of the post's vouchers and overstated obligation reports provided a false picture of the post's financial position. Improvements were also needed at all five posts in monitoring appropriated funds, overseeing deposit funds, reducing unliquidated obligation balances, and correcting weak internal control systems. Administrative and personnel matters require more attention. Managers in Washington and Beijing have to pay more attention to the administrative and personnel matters of US&FCS China. Because the post is staffed primarily with less experienced officers, more mentoring and training are needed, and efforts must be made to bring more experienced officers to China. Management must also work on retaining the foreign national staff by providing them with better training, classifying them at appropriate grades, and helping them advance in their careers. Greater focus must also be placed on more effectively tracking property and coordinating information technology needs. Finally, we urged the post and US&FCS Washington to explore options to relocate the Beijing post, which has outstripped its available space and resulted in an inefficient, less-than-professional-looking office environment.  l  We also devoted sections of our report to each of US&FCS China's five constituent posts, discussing their successes and making recommendations in areas needing improvement. We highlighted the accomplishments of the Shanghai Commercial Center, which had an active schedule of trade Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  37   International Trade Administration events. However, we urged the post to work more closely with its four collocated state government and trade association partners. US&FCS agreed with most of our recommendations and identified the steps it has taken to implement some of them. We were especially pleased to see that the posts and US&FCS headquarters have indicated their commitment to address many of the program gaps and management and administrative problems highlighted in our report. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-10915) Brazil With an estimated population of 162 million and a gross domestic product of $800 billion, Brazil represents the United States' third largest market in the Western Hemisphere, after Canada and Mexico. Economic reform and privatization of state-owned enterprises are opening new markets and resulting in unprecedented opportunities for U.S. business. The United States is the largest foreign investor in Brazil, accounting for almost 34 percent of total foreign direct investment. The US&FCS commercial post in Brazil is the fifth largest in the world, in terms of dollars and staff, with total FY 1998 expenditures of $3.1 million. We observed the post's operations and activities, located in the cities of So Paulo, Brasilia, Belo Horizonte, and Rio de Janeiro. We found that US&FCS Brazil is an energetic post that is meeting its mission of serving U.S. exporters. In addition, the So Paulo Commercial Center, the most significant feature of post operations, is being used creatively and actively to support the post's programs and the needs of U.S. exporters and Brazilian importers. Other positive aspects of US&FCS Brazil's operations include an improved program under the commercial officer present during the time of our review; frequent, extensive communications between management and staff, and between So Paolo and its constituent posts; extensive marketing and outreach; and new, innovative programs to promote U.S. products. However, we also identified concerns in a number of financial, program, and management areas that need to be addressed. Our most significant observations were as follows: l  Scope and use of performance tracking system need to be reconsidered. While US&FCS Brazil has designed and implemented an effective work and performance tracking system for its operations, the system appears to be inappropriately determining individual priorities and may be undermining teamwork and cooperation among staff. Post management needs to rethink this Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  38   International Trade Administration concept and revise the system to counter these side effects. In addition, US&FCS headquarters should evaluate the system's appropriateness for other posts. l  So Paulo Commercial Center needs to be refocused and more effectively managed. Recognizing that each commercial center must adapt to the unique needs of its market, we nevertheless have concerns about whether the appropriate priorities have been set for the So Paulo Commercial Center and whether the center may be missing opportunities to fully implement the commercial center program. We believe that the problems are caused by the post's priorities for its center differing from those set by US&FCS headquarters for the overall center program, and the lack of adequate oversight and support from US&FCS headquarters to help ensure that the program is successful and complies with the requirements outlined in the program's authorizing legislation. Minority business position needs further refinement and proven results. The post's minority business development commercial assistant position is not well integrated with the Department's minority business activities. In addition, the position has inadequately defined responsibilities that appear to overlap with those of other trade specialists at the post. We also question whether So Paulo is the appropriate location for the position and whether there is sufficient market potential and results to justify continuing it. Improved coordination between the post and other stakeholders is needed. Opportunities for good working relationships between US&FCS Brazil and other federal and ITA components, as well as with some host country organizations, are not being fully exploited and appear to be highly dependent upon personal relationships. The post's relationships with other embassy officials were generally positive. However, it needs to improve its relationships with the US&FCS domestic offices. Market research and product timeliness need to be made higher priorities. We identified two important core US&FCS products that need to be emphasized and improved. First, the post is not producing timely responses to Agent/Distributor Service requests, and there is some question about the overall quality of the responses. Second, the post is not consistently producing highquality market research reports and is significantly behind schedule in producing some of these reports. 39  l  l  l  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   International Trade Administration l  Financial management, procurement, and internal controls need significant attention. We observed a pervasive lack of adequate financial management practices and internal controls in the post's operations. We noted significant management control weaknesses in the handling of cash, use of purchase orders, inventory and management of government personal property, credit card transactions, the management of a large information technology contract, and documentation of the use of government vehicles.  We made a number of recommendations to address our concerns. Although US&FCS agreed with the vast majority of our observations and recommendations and noted areas where changes and improvements had been made since our visit, it also identified a number of areas where it disagreed with our report's analysis. We requested that US&FCS provide an action plan addressing any outstanding issues noted in the report. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-10916) South Africa South Africa is reportedly the most advanced, broadly based, and productive economy in Africa. Its gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly four times that of Egypt, its nearest competitor on the continent. Some experts suggest, however, that the South African economy must strive for an annual GDP growth rate of 5 to 10 percent to offset its high unemployment rate and an annual population growth rate of 2 percent. Efforts to achieve this economic growth will provide opportunities for American companies with appropriate products or services. American companies already have a strong presence in South Africa. U.S. exports to the country totaled $3 billion in 1997, and South Africa was the recipient of approximately 47 percent of all American exports to Sub-Saharan Africa. Because of South Africa's importance as a trading partner, ITA has three offices in the country (Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban) to provide American exporters with products and services that will help them establish or expand their presence not only in South Africa, but in other southern African nations as well. The post was allocated $1.4 million in FY 1998, an increase of more than 40 percent from FY 1997. The OIG's inspection of US&FCS South Africa found that clients were generally satisfied with the trade promotion efforts of the post's staff. In addition, the commercial center was highlighted by many of the post's clients as an effective forum for U.S. companies and government officials to launch their new initiatives, agendas, or products. Although the post was 40 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   International Trade Administration generally effective at promoting U.S. exports to South Africa, we found several aspects of the post's promotional and administrative operations that require management attention: l  The post's effectiveness has been limited by programmatic and organizational problems. Specifically, staff productivity was hampered by inefficient work assignments given to foreign service nationals and personal services contractors, relations between the post and ITA's Advocacy Center were not as strong as possible, and client and partner data were not being routinely entered into the Client Management System. Despite showing promise, the commercial center is not actively recruiting partners. Although the center was pursuing its objectives of providing a variety of products and services to facilitate commercial ties and trade, it had not fully embraced ITA's goal to include partners in the center. In addition, although the center had two collocated partners, a reimbursable agreement or memorandum of understanding was not in place for the shortterm partner, and the agreement with the year-long partner was not adequately monitored. Finally, the officer hired as center director was frequently pulled away from his responsibilities at the center to handle work related to the many high-level visitors to the post or other post business. Staff turnover resulted in potential leadership void . With the scheduled turnover of all Johannesburg officers within a sevenmonth period, the post faced a serious leadership void at the time of our inspection. Only at the last minute were officer positions filled or incumbents selected. By not better planning to fill upcoming vacancies, US&FCS headquarters could jeopardize mission goals and undermine staff morale. Financial operations need improvement. Although the post had taken steps to get its financial operations in order, we found the imprest fund to be in dire need of management attention. In addition, our review of the post's financial records revealed substantial unliquidated obligations in its operations and administration account. We also found little correlation between the post's FY 1998 collections records and official ITA accounting data. Several administrative matters require management attention. The post handled procurement, time and attendance, and vehicle control logs in accordance with policies and procedures. However, we observed that personnel records were not complete or updated, 41  l  l  l  l  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   International Trade Administration credit cards were underutilized, and the division of administrative service responsibilities between the State Department and US&FCS South Africa was unclear. We concluded that many of the post's financial and administrative problems stemmed from a lack of sufficient training for both foreign service nationals and American staff. l  Export control checks were handled well, but guidelines were not always followed. We were generally impressed with the thoroughness of the end-use checks conducted by the post to assist BXA in fulfilling its export control responsibilities. However, some improvements were needed to comply with BXA guidelines, and more coordination with other embassy offices would enhance information gathering.  We made several recommendations to ITA and US&FCS to resolve our concerns. Agency officials generally agreed with our findings and outlined steps US&FCS was taking or planned to take to address our recommendations. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-11433)  US&FCS Is Addressing Foreign Service Personnel Management Issues The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs the OIG to conduct periodic audits of US&FCS operations that include an evaluation of the agency's management of its foreign service personnel system and the placement of domestic- and foreign-based personnel. To fulfill the act's requirements, the OIG conducted an audit of US&FCS's management of its personnel system and resource allocation methodology. Our review evaluated a broad range of personnel issues, including the management and oversight of the personnel system, recruitment, assignments, limited appointments, tours of duty, curtailments, and performance appraisals. We also looked at the status of US&FCS's overseas and domestic resource allocation models. We found that US&FCS is generally striving to address its personnel issues. Specifically, US&FCS has established internal task forces involving diverse groups of employees to address issues of concern to foreign service officers, and has taken action to comply with most prior OIG recommendations. For example, it revised its overseas resource allocation model in response to a 1997 OIG inspection report (see September 1997 issue, page 27). Based on the revised model, US&FCS completed a review of its overseas officer staffing pattern and shifted resources accordingly. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  42   International Trade Administration Although US&FCS has addressed a variety of personnel issues, several areas still need improvement. Specifically, US&FCS had difficulty filling vacancies in hardship posts and adhering to the guideline requiring officers to have a domestic assignment at least every 15 years, continued to waive or lower language proficiency requirements when no candidates met the existing requirements, had not implemented a comprehensive automated system for personnel data, had yet to consolidate certain personnel functions with ITA as we recommended earlier, and had not defined adequate performance measures for its foreign service personnel system to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act. Among our recommendations were that US&FCS (1) develop and implement a formal career candidate recruitment policy, (2) implement new measures to meet the 15-year guideline for domestic assignments, (3) explore, with ITA management, consolidating personnel functions that are common to the foreign and civil service personnel systems, (4) establish performance goals and related performance measures that specifically define foreign service personnel system outcomes, and (5) update the domestic resource allocation model for use as the objective analytical basis for allocating domestic resources. ITA generally agreed with our findings and recommendations. (Business and Trade Audits Division: BTD-108299-0001)  Financial Assistance Program Promotes Merit-Based Decisions As part of its Department-wide review of Commerce discretionary financial assistance programs, the OIG conducted a performance audit of ITA's Special American Business Internship Training Program (SABIT). The objective of our review was to assess the criteria, procedures, and practices used for the solicitation, review, and selection of applications for financial assistance under SABIT. SABIT provides financial assistance to for-profit and nonprofit public and private entities for training business executives and scientists from the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union in the American way of doing business. In FY 1997, the program received 64 applications for assistance, and issued 28 new awards and 5 renewals totaling more than $500,000. We found that the program used merit-based technical and public policy criteria to evaluate applications, and that its solicitation efforts in FY 1997 generated a widespread response from eligible applicants. ITA also followed established requirements for selecting applications for Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  43   International Trade Administration funding under SABIT. However, one of the four review panels used during the evaluation process was not independent of program administration. ITA corrected the problem in 1997 and provided information demonstrating that all subsequent review panels were independent. (Atlanta Regional Office of Audits: ATL-10998-9-0001)  44  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Planned Consolidation at Norman, Oklahoma, Needs Refinement NOAA leases approximately 106,000 square feet of space on the North and South campuses of the University of Oklahoma, in the city of Norman, at a cost of about $1 million per year. NOAA's space on the North Campus consists of about 72,000 square feet in Building 600, the Adair Building, and several temporary buildings, which house the National Severe Storms Laboratory, the Storm Prediction Center, the weather forecast office, and part of the NEXRAD Operational Support Facility (OSF). On the South Campus, NOAA leases about 34,000 square feet in the OSF South Building, which houses the remaining OSF staff. In December 1998, program officials briefed NOAA's senior management on a proposal for consolidating NOAA's operations in two new buildings, totaling 145,500 square feet, with annual lease and utility costs of about $5 million per year. Because the submitted proposal did not include the required functional requirements analysis, it has not yet received final NOAA or departmental approval. NOAA has since contracted with an architectural and engineering firm to provide this detailed information for its revised decision package. NOAA believes that collocating its Norman components with the university's meteorological research groups and its school of meteorology would provide substantial benefits for both organizations. Collocation would create a joint NOAA-university weather center and give NOAA staff access to the university's facilities and personnel, whose expertise could contribute significantly to the development of new forecast technologies. The OIG conducted an assessment of NOAA's justification for the proposed Norman consolidation. Because the bureau had not completed a functional requirements analysis, we did not perform a detailed audit of its space needs. Instead, we opted to review NOAA's preliminary proposal in order to give the bureau feedback on its process for consolidation and to identify potential areas for future detailed audit work. After reviewing NOAA's proposal, we made some observations about how the bureau could reduce the cost of the proposed consolidation. l The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studies climate and global change; ensures the protection of coastal oceans and the management of marine resources; provides weather services; and manages worldwide environmental data. It does this through the following organizations: National Weather Service. NWS reports the weather of the United States and provides weather forecasts and warnings to the general public. National Ocean Service. NOS issues nautical and aeronautical charts; performs geodetic surveys; conducts research; and develops policies on ocean mining and energy. National Marine Fisheries Service. NMFS conducts a program of management, research, and services related to the protection and rational use of living marine resources. National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. NESDIS observes the environment by operating a national satellite system. Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. OAR conducts research related to the oceans and inland waters, the lower and upper atmosphere, space environment, and the Earth. Office of NOAA Corps Operations. The Corps is the nation's seventh uniformed service. Its ships, aircraft, and personnel support NOAA's activities throughout the world.  Savings would be realized by continuing to lease the North Campus buildings. We asked NOAA about the possibility of using Building 600 and the Adair Building to consolidate all OSF staff on the North Campus. NOAA officials agreed that this could be done, but noted that Building 600 would need renovations,  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  45   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which university officials estimate would cost between $100,000 and $200,000. We believe that adopting this approach will save NOAA about $600,000 a year, or $12 million over 20 years. Because of the potential savings from using both North Campus facilities, NOAA should consider constructing only one new facility to consolidate the National Severe Storms Laboratory, the Storm Prediction Center, and the weather forecast office with the university, while continuing to lease Building 600, the Adair Building, and the NEXRAD facility. l NOAA Corps Operations  NOAA  National Weather Service National Marine Fisheries Service Oceanic and Atmospheric Research  National Ocean Service  NESDIS  Building 600 is severely overcrowded. As a result, some NOAA staff are being housed in temporary structures, there is insufficient space for research and engineering functions, and workstations are very small. Nevertheless, the facility was in generally good condition, and university officials stated that if NOAA decided to stay, they would work to improve the facility. Adair Building has sufficient space. The building is in overall good condition and there is no overcrowding. However, some areas should be reconfigured for better use if NOAA personnel continue to occupy the building. South Building is not crowded, but consolidation of OSF on the North Campus is desirable . The OSF South Building is not large enough to consolidate all OSF staff, and consolidating the staff from the North Campus there would hinder OSF in its mission of supporting the NEXRAD radar module, which is located on the North Campus. Relocating the radar would cost more than $2 million. In addition, the OSF director strongly supports consolidating all his staff on the North Campus, because the current separation hampers operational efficiency. Collocation on the South Campus would be costly. NOAA's proposal to collocate with the university would result in lease costs of about $38 per square foot. This relatively high cost results largely from the university's policy of building high-quality structures to last 100 years. As the current OSF South Building costs about $11 per square foot to lease, the proposed rate would result in NOAA paying about 3 times as much per square foot. This substantial cost increase may outweigh the benefits of collocation.  l  l  l  We recommended that NOAA (1) complete a functional requirements analysis to accurately determine the space requirements for the Norman consolidation, (2) evaluate the alternative of building and leasing only one building and continuing to lease Building 600 and the Adair Building on the 46 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration North Campus, and (3) explore ways of reducing the $38 per square foot rate to lease a new building to be constructed on the South Campus. NOAA agreed with all three of our recommendations and said that it had already taken action to implement the first two. In response to the third recommendation, NOAA stated that it now plans to capitalize the construction of new and renovated space instead of leasing the facilities. As a result, we believe that NOAA's planned action should focus on lowering the cost of the proposed construction. We plan to continue monitoring NOAA's construction cost estimates and supporting documentation.

The compensation covers both economic and property loss. The fund is administered by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and is funded by fees assessed against oil and gas companies operating mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, the fund paid 54 claims totaling $322,000, and had a balance of $1.5 million. NMFS develops filing and reporting requirements for fishermen, adjusts claims, and compensates eligible applicants. To address concerns about the fund's internal controls, NMFS conducted a review in May 1992 and made recommendations designed to improve the fund's controls and efficiency. Before that review, the fund had a history of fraudulent claims paid due to internal control deficiencies. The OIG conducted an audit to evaluate the effectiveness of NMFS's internal controls over the fund and to assess the trend of paid claims. We found that past problems had been corrected, internal controls were properly in place, and recommendations made by NMFS in its 1992 review were being adhered to. We also noted that there has been a significant decline in the average total dollar amount of claims paid over the past 11 years. The average annual total of paid claims was $713,000 in FYs 1988-91, dropped to $513,000 in FYs 1992-94, and declined further to $264,000 in FYs 1995-98 (see following chart). The fund's manager attributed the decline to several factors, including NMFS's vigorous referral of questionable Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  47   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Fishermen's Contingency Fund Average Annual Dollar Amount of Claims Paid Fiscal Years 1988-98 $800,000 $700,000 $600,000 $500,000 $400,000 $300,000 $200,000 $100,000 $0 1988-91 1992-94 1995-98 Fiscal Years  $713,000 $513,000  $264,000  White text  cases to the OIG for investigation, which has served as a deterrent to fraudulent claims; claimants seeking compensation from a state program; and the declining number of shrimp vessels because of overfishing and smaller profits. In response to this decline, NMFS has reduced the number of staff required to administer the fund. But the sharp decline in the dollar amount of paid claims raises the issue of the long-term need for the fund. We recommended that NMFS reexamine whether there is sufficient need for maintaining the fund within the agency. NOAA agreed with our findings and recommendation and will conduct a study regarding the continued need for the program. (Science and Technology Audits Division: STD-11484-9-0001)  Risks Are Low, but Additional Steps Are Needed to Ensure Y2K Compliance at NESDIS As part of its review of the efforts by the Department and its bureaus to ensure year 2000 (Y2K) compliance for critical Commerce computer systems, the OIG conducted an inspection of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service's (NESDIS) efforts to make its automated information systems Y2K compliant and to develop contingencies in the event that these systems fail as a result of the year 2000 date change. 48 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration We concluded that the likelihood of NESDIS satellite operations and satellite data processing being interrupted due to Y2K failure is low because the agency exercised stringent quality control over system renovations and conducted thorough end-to-end tests. Also, because NESDIS's systems use year data infrequently, they have a low susceptibility to Y2K failures. However, we expressed concern that NESDIS had not completed its system inventory, which raised doubt that all systems had been evaluated for Y2K compliance. As a result, at least one system that should have been tested for compliance--the Telemetry Acquisition and Command Transmission System--was not. NESDIS agreed to complete its inventory and evaluate any new systems found for Y2K compliance. We also found that NESDIS needs to significantly improve and ensure the accuracy of its business continuity and contingency plans. Although NESDIS has standard procedures for handling problems with its satellite operations and satellite data processing, the agency did not augment them with contingencies for Y2K-specific failures. The agency did not plan to test Y2K-specific contingencies and was instituting only limited procedures for reducing risk with computer operations for the days surrounding the century change (referred to as a ""Day One Plan""). NESDIS has agreed to update its continuity and contingency plans and to prepare a Day One Plan. NESDIS has informal procedures for managing the risk of introducing changes to operational systems, but it has not established an official policy for managing changes to systems that have been confirmed to be Y2K compliant. OMB has directed agencies to establish a policy limiting changes to Y2K-compliant systems so that compliance can be maintained. NESDIS has agreed to establish such a policy. Finally, we found several minor deficiencies in the system renovation process. We made several recommendations to address our concerns. NESDIS agreed with all of our recommendations and has taken or plans to take actions to address them. (Office of Systems Evaluation: OSE-12199)  Reviews of NOAA Discretionary Funding Programs Show Mixed Results During this semiannual period, the OIG issued reports on its audits of the criteria, procedures, and practices for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting applications in FY 1997 for awards under three NOAA discretionary financial assistance programs: Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  49   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration l  Meteorologic and Hydrologic Modernization Development Program (National Weather Service). Marine Fisheries Initiative Program (National Marine Fisheries Service). Fisheries Development and Utilization Research and Development Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program (National Marine Fisheries Service).  l  l  The audits were conducted as part of a Department-wide review of Commerce's discretionary financial assistance programs. As discussed below, the three programs had varying degrees of success in utilizing processes designed to result in merit-based selections of applications for funding. Meteorologic and Hydrologic Modernization Development Program The Meteorologic and Hydrologic Modernization Development Program provides financial assistance to entities for the use and development of meteorological or hydrological forecasts or forecast methodology. During FY 1997 (our review period), the program awarded two new cooperative agreements, two new grants, two continuation amendments to existing cooperative agreements, and one grant renewal, for a total of more than $4.9 million. We found that NWS did not administer the program as a competitionbased financial assistance program as prescribed by Commerce guidelines. Instead, recipients were selected on a non-competitive, sole-source basis. In addition, the written justifications for program awards did not cite any factual basis for the routine assertions that the applicants were the only entities that could perform the work. We recommended that NWS ensure that program awards are made through a competitive process, unless otherwise mandated by law or adequately justified, and that the award process comply with Department policies and procedures and include the following four elements: (1) widespread solicitation of eligible applications and disclosure of essential application and program information in written solicitations, (2) independent application reviews that consistently apply written program evaluation criteria, (3) written justifications for award decisions that deviate from recommendations made by application reviewers, and (4) adequate written justifications for noncompetitive awards that document appropriate market search efforts to validate determinations that 50 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration there is only one source for anticipated sole-source awards. We also recommended that NOAA's Grants Management Division perform reviews of proposed noncompetitive awards to determine whether they meet Department and NOAA requirements. In response to our report, NOAA agreed that more awards should be made competitively in its discretionary funding programs and that a more rigorous solicitation process should be used. NOAA said that it is continuing to look at its processes and will provide more detail as part of its audit action plan for this report. (Atlanta Regional Office of Audits: ATL-114059-0001) Marine Fisheries Initiative Program The Marine Fisheries Initiative Program provides financial assistance for research and development projects that provide information for the full and wise use and enhancement of fishery resources in the southeastern United States. In FY 1997, the program received 73 applications for over $7.6 million in financial assistance and awarded 11 grants totaling more than $915,000. We found that program officials had developed and published appropriate merit-based criteria for use in evaluating financial assistance applications for funding, and that the application solicitation, review, and selection process followed by the program is designed to promote meritbased funding decisions. However, we found that some of the program's review and selection practices needed improvement. Specifically, we recommended that program officials keep a record of the scientific panel's vote count, and maintain adequate documentation of the bases for award decisions that deviate from the independent panel's recommendations. NOAA concurred in our findings and recommendations, and it has agreed to begin implementing them with the program's next selection process. (Atlanta Regional Office of Audits: ATL-11655-9-0001) Fisheries Development and Utilization Research and Development Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program Commonly known as the S-K Program, this program provides financial assistance for research and development projects that address various aspects of U.S. fisheries, including harvesting, processing, marketing, and associated infrastructure. In FY 1997, NMFS made 75 financial assistance awards totaling more than $8 million under this program.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  51   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration We found that the S-K Program had criteria that were merit-based and appropriate for selecting applications for funding, and that the application solicitation process was adequate to obtain a nationwide response. However, selection decisions that deviated from application rankings were not adequately justified and documented, and we believe that NMFS could have relied more extensively on competitive program applicants to meet its research needs. We recommended that NMFS ensure that reasons for selecting applications ranked lower than other applications are thoroughly documented. Additionally, NMFS officials need to place more emphasis on addressing research needs and priorities competitively, and ensure that program funding priorities are developed and published in detail to provide the public an opportunity to address the agency's specific research needs. NOAA agreed with our recommendations and believes that implementation of the recommendations will enhance the program's overall effectiveness. (Seattle Regional Office of Audits: STL-10950-9-0001)  Improved Internal Controls Needed over Mountain Support Center Bankcard Program As part of its periodic review of Commerce units' use of bankcards, the OIG conducted an audit of FY 1998 bankcard activities at NOAA's Mountain Administrative Support Center in Boulder, Colorado. The purpose of our audit was to determine whether the center was properly using bankcards in accordance with applicable federal and departmental requirements. The audit involved reviewing a stratified sample of 67 of the center's 1,240 transactions for FY 1998. The objectives of the bankcard program, established government-wide in 1989, are to reduce administrative procurement costs, improve cash management by expediting and simplifying small purchases, and strengthen internal controls to eliminate the vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse of other small purchase methods. For the most part, these goals have been achieved at the center. Although we did not identify any specific misuse of funds, our audit of the center's bankcard program disclosed a number of weaknesses in internal controls and instances of noncompliance with federal regulations and departmental guidance. These weaknesses need to be corrected to improve internal controls over the bankcard program. Specific problems included the failure to provide cardholders with required training, document alternate approving officials, complete property transaction forms, promote competition for purchases over $2,500, pre-approve Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  52   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration significant purchases, maintain a purchase order log, keep bankcards in a secure location, follow the priority order of mandatory sources of supply, and reconcile questioned items. We made recommendations to center officials to address these internal control deficiencies. NOAA agreed with our findings and recommendations. (Denver Regional Office of Audits: DEN-11927-9-0001)  Grantee Failed to Comply with Fishing Industry Award and Produced Limited Project Results In February 1995, NOAA awarded a grant of nearly $655,000 to a Massachusetts firm as part of the agency's Fishing Industry Grant program. This program assists the depressed northeastern fishing industry by providing financial assistance to fishermen, processors, and fishermen's associations, and to recipients who assist or train fishermen in research and management activities for marine and estuarine resources. The grant, intended to fund a demonstration project on raising flounder on land, required the recipient to build and equip a hatchery on the New England coast to produce 120,000 young flounder over the 18-month project duration. The recipient was to contribute about $447,000 to the project, bringing the total budget to $1,102,000. In a financial and compliance audit, the OIG found that the grantee had achieved only limited results from the award because it materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the grant agreement. Specifically, the grantee built and equipped a hatchery at its own inland location rather than at either of the NOAA-approved coastal locations, provided only half of the required young flounder (which it purchased, rather than raised), and failed to provide the requisite training and transfer of technological expertise. In addition, the grantee did not maintain a financial management system that complied with federal cost accounting standards. As a result of these deficiencies, we questioned about $190,000 in costs related to the hatchery being operated at the unapproved location and another $490,000 related to financial management deficiencies, for a total of about $680,000 in questioned costs. We recommended that NOAA disallow all project costs claimed, terminate the grant, and recover the full $655,000 in grant funds disbursed to the recipient.

In the March 1999 issue (page 59), we reported the conviction of a Florida fisherman and his wife for conspiracy to defraud the government through the filing of false claims under the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Disaster Program. In June 1999, they were each sentenced in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to three years' probation, and ordered to make restitution of $4,978. (Denver Field Office of Investigations) Conviction. On September 24, 1999, a former NOAA employee was convicted of one count of theft of government property after an OIG investigation disclosed that she had obtained more than $7,000 from an agency imprest fund by submitting 57 false vouchers for payment. Sentencing is scheduled for December 1999 in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. (Financial Fraud Division) Resignation. An NMFS enforcement agent resigned from federal service to resolve a Merit Systems Protection Board appeal of his proposed termination, which was based upon his acceptance of $500 from a commercial fisherman. After initially denying the charge to OIG investigators, the agent was confronted with a copy of a canceled check bearing his signature and acknowledged that he had accepted a ""loan"" from the fisherman, whose business was subject to regulation under fisheries laws administered by NMFS. (Silver Spring Field Office of Investigations)  Audit Reports Unresolved for Over Six Months As of September 30, 1999, nine performance audit reports had recommendations unresolved in excess of six months. Light Aircraft Operations The first unresolved performance audit report, Light Aircraft Fleet Should Be Privatized, STD-9952-8-0001 (see September 1998 issue, page 44), recommended that NOAA cease operating its eight light fixedwing aircraft and three helicopters and release them, along with related spare parts. We also recommended that NOAA discontinue all interagency reimbursable work related to NOAA-owned fixed-wing light aircraft and helicopters. We added that, pending discontinuance of the reimbursable work, NOAA should complete current interagency agreements in accordance with its policy of full cost recovery; revise its billing practices to be consistent with, and achieve, full cost recovery; and seek reimbursement of the unrecovered full cost balances on all current reimbursable projects. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  54   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA did not concur with most of our findings and recommendations. The bureau believes that discontinuing use of the aircraft would compromise its ability to continue uninterrupted data collection efforts required to protect lives and property, and would increase the risk of accidents and the cost of aircraft support. In addition, NOAA did not agree with our recommendation to recover full costs, noting that cost sharing and waiving of overhead costs is appropriate for interagency cooperative agreements that are beneficial to NOAA, and that interagency agreements have proved to be cost-effective in meeting some of its data collection needs. NOAA officials have entered into a consulting contract to obtain an analysis of its aircraft fleet. The analysis is to include a review of light aircraft costs and the costs to contract for similar private-sector aircraft services and support. NOAA also believes that our audit report overstated the bureau's aircraft costs by $1.3 million and that its light aircraft are cost competitive. After reviewing NOAA's audit action plan, we concurred with action taken or planned for 4 of our 10 recommendations. However, we did not believe that NOAA's actions, or other information provided in the plan, were sufficient to warrant a concurrence on the other six recommendations. In particular, we reaffirmed our conclusion that the full in-house cost to operate NOAA's fleet of 10 light aircraft averaged 42 percent more than the cost to contract for similar private-sector aircraft that can provide equivalent services. We also reaffirmed our conclusion that the Aircraft Operations Center is not recovering the full cost of work that it performs under reimbursable agreements with non-Commerce federal agencies. We have proposed that after NOAA's contracted review of its aircraft is completed and the report issued, the bureau submit a revised audit action plan addressing the unresolved recommendations. NMFS Laboratory Structure The second unresolved performance audit report, NMFS Laboratory Structure Should Be Streamlined, STL-8982-8-0001 (see March 1998 issue, page 39), recommended closing several laboratory facilities and transferring their programs and personnel to other NMFS laboratories. We also recommended that one laboratory and most of its programs be transferred to the state of Maryland, and that the proposed Santa Cruz, California, facility be expanded to accommodate programs and personnel from another California laboratory. Our analysis indicated that our recommended changes would result in increased efficiencies and cost savings of more than $25 million over a five-year period. In addition, we differed with NMFS's plans to transfer some programs from a Seattle laboratory to the proposed Auke Cape facility in Alaska, Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  55   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration because there is insufficient space at the proposed facility to accommodate the programs and the costs associated with such a move would be in excess of $20 million. NOAA disagreed with our findings and recommendations. In April 1998, we requested NOAA to submit a revised audit action plan, and subsequent meetings were held between OIG and NOAA officials. NOAA submitted a revised plan in November 1998, but did not change its initial position. Negotiations with NOAA concerning alternative approaches to resolution are continuing. NOAA's Discretionary Funding Programs The remaining seven unresolved performance audits relate to discretionary funding programs in NESDIS, NMFS, NWS, and the National Ocean Service. In each of these audits, we recommended that NOAA ensure that financial assistance awards are made on the basis of a competitive review and selection process, unless otherwise mandated by law or adequately justified, and that the process complies with Department policies and procedures. NOAA generally agreed with our recommendations, and has submitted an audit action plan that we are currently reviewing.  56  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   National Telecommunications and Information Administration Internal Controls over Bankcard Use Are Sound In conjunction with an OIG plan to periodically review Commerce units' use of bankcards, we conducted an audit of NTIA's FY 1998 bankcard activities to determine whether the bureau was properly using bankcards in accordance with applicable federal and departmental requirements. Our audit covered over 1,100 transactions, totaling more than $680,000, made by NTIA headquarters during the year. We found that continued oversight by NTIA management, and by NIST staff who provide contracting support to the bureau, has resulted in sound internal controls over NTIA bankcard transactions. We also found that NIST personnel properly conducted the required annual review of bankcard use for 1998. However, we did note several minor internal control deficiencies requiring management action: (1) the large number of cardholders, coupled with the small percentage of purchasing power used, suggested that the number of cardholders should be reduced for greater efficiency, (2) several cardholders were not storing their cards in a secure location as required, and (3) training for cardholders needed to be provided and documented. We made several recommendations to NTIA regarding these minor deficiencies. NTIA agreed with all of our findings and recommendations except the recommendation that it reduce the number of cardholders. The agency believes that the current distribution of cardholders is appropriate based on the needs of the program offices and has advantages for management control. We continue to recommend that NTIA examine the need to have so many cardholders to permit more efficient utilization of its bankcards.

Sciences International Affairs  Telecom. and Information Applications  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  57   Patent and Trademark Office The Patent and Trademark Office administers the nation's patent and trademark laws. Patents are granted, and trademarks registered, under a system intended to provide incentives to invent, to invest in research, to commercialize new technology, and to draw attention to inventions that would otherwise go unnoticed. PTO also collects, assembles, publishes, and disseminates technological information disclosed in patents.  Patent Inventory, Printing, and Dissemination Issues Need Attention PTO's Office of Patent Publications (OPP) ensures the production of individual patent documents and several related products for the benefit of the bureau and its customers in its post-examination process. After patent applications have been allowed by examiners, they are sent to OPP, which oversees the complex process of image-capturing, printing, publishing, and disseminating them around the world. OPP products include the weekly Official Gazette, the official journal of issued patents and PTO notices; the patent image file used to support the Automated Patent System; and conversion files used to make microfilm copies of patents. The OIG conducted an audit of OPP operations to identify the causes of the large inventory of patents in the post-examination process, review initiatives to reduce publishing time, review selected aspects of the printing process, and determine whether OPP is complying with significant laws and regulations applicable to the post-examination process. We concluded that management attention is needed in two areas. Actions Needed to Reduce the Large Inventory of Pending Applications Although OPP increased the number of patents processed annually by 47 percent from FY 1993 to FY 1998, the inventory of patents awaiting final processing increased by 51 percent during that period. We found that: l  Despite increased productivity, a large inventory of allowed patents awaiting final processing still exists because the total number of patents allowed by examiners has increased each year, patents have not been processed by OPP until applicants pay issue fees, and OPP's production capacity has been limited. OPP's efforts to reduce the inventory have overburdened data compilation activities. Because of sustained increases in the size of the Official Gazette, OPP has not been able to deliver products to the database contractor in time for compilation. Late deliveries of processed patents to the printing contractor have delayed printing operations, although recent data indicates improvements in this area. Initiatives to improve the process may decease publishing time, but still may not meet PTO's goals. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  l  l  l  58   Patent and Trademark Office We recommended that PTO establish a plan to resolve these issues, reduce the inventory, and publish patents within four weeks to meet the goal set forth in its FY 1999 Corporate Plan. It should do this by assessing the effect on cycle time of processing files for publication before receiving fees, processing patents more rapidly for timely delivery to the database contractor, assisting the database and printing contractors in meeting their obligations on time, and considering further consolidation of the database compilation and printing processes. Patent Dissemination Needs Streamlining, and the Printing Contract Needs Increased PTO Oversight Having been designated by the Vice President as a ""High Impact Agency"" directed to focus on using information technology and providing customer service, PTO has established as one of its goals moving to a paperless patent publishing process by FY 2003. However, we found that: l  Patent and Trademark Office Assistant Commissioner for Patents Associate Commissioner and CFO Assistant Commissioner for Trademarks Chief Information Officer  PTO spends an average of $1.5 million a year to print hard copies of the Official Gazette and produces microfilm products, although information from the Gazette is available at various locations on its Internet web site. By law, the Government Printing Office (GPO) serves as OPP's contracting agent for the procurement of printing services, but PTO is capable of providing such services more efficiently inhouse. Since FY 1992, OPP has paid an average of $230,000 annually in handling fees to GPO. GPO and OPP may have approved the printing contractor's claims of over $218,000 for overtime and other expenses incurred because of PTO's late delivery of processed patents without adequately substantiating the claims or involving the onsite quality control specialist in key discussions with GPO and the contractor.  l  l  We recommended that PTO (1) disseminate all patent-related products, including the Official Gazette, on the Internet by the end of FY 2003 and conduct customer surveys to determine which printed products can be eliminated to reduce costs; (2) consider pursuing a waiver from the Congress, or the necessary legislation, to independently handle its own printing contract; (3) ask GPO to review the basis of the printing contractor's future claims of expenses incurred as a result of late patent deliveries; and (4) involve the onsite quality assurance specialist more in overseeing the database and printing contractors.  v  v  v  v  v 59  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Patent and Trademark Office PTO agreed with our recommendations and described a number of measures it is taking to implement them. For example, PTO expects that a new method of publishing patents will ultimately reduce the patent publishing cycle time by 10 weeks. Other measures that PTO is taking or will take to address our recommendations include eliminating delays in the delivery of magnetic tapes to the database contractor, meeting weekly with the contractor to resolve problems, initiating a customer survey to determine which products may be eliminated under a move to paperless patent dissemination, and strengthening the role of the onsite quality assurance specialist. (Business and Trade Audits Division: BTD-10996-9-0001)  Additional Steps Needed to Better Ensure Y2K Compliance As part of its review of efforts by the Department and its bureaus to ensure year 2000 compliance for critical Commerce computer systems, the OIG conducted an inspection of PTO's work to make its automated information systems Y2K compliant. We found that PTO's renovation and replacement activities for selected critical systems resulted in Y2K compliance, and that the systems were adequately tested. However, PTO plans to significantly modify two of its most critical and vulnerable systems--the Patent Application Location and Monitoring system and the Trademark Reporting and Monitoring system--and upgrade the operating system of the mainframe computer on which these systems reside. The modifications and upgrade were to be completed in September and October 1999, but PTO has no plans for comprehensive retesting to ensure that the systems and computer remain Y2K compliant. PTO believes that testing the units of software involved in these systems will be sufficient to identify any Y2K problems that may be introduced during the modifications and upgrade. But we believe that endto-end testing is necessary to verify that the combined units will work together as an application, and that each application will function as intended as a system or with other systems with which it interfaces. We recommended that PTO freeze software changes to critical systems as of November 30, 1999; then conduct an end-to-end test of the systems, the mainframe computer, and critical interfaces; and keep all critical hardware and software configurations frozen until at least the second week of January 2000 to ensure that there are no Y2K operating difficulties. We also found that PTO's Y2K systems inventory may not be complete. Based on the minimal response to an earlier survey of systems users and the recent identification of an important system that was not Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  60   Patent and Trademark Office previously inventoried, there is some doubt that all smaller PTO systems developed by users have been inventoried and evaluated for Y2K compliance. We recommended that PTO resurvey operational areas to identify user-developed applications that are used in performing core business processes. In response to our report, PTO agreed with all our recommendations but one--it continues to believe that end-to-end testing of the modified systems is unnecessary. (Office of Systems Evaluation: OSE-11693)  Problems with Interagency Agreements Being Addressed by PTO Management PTO, like many other agencies, uses interagency agreements to obtain goods and services through other federal agencies. From 1995 through 1997, PTO's use of these agreements increased significantly to support its information technology (IT) requirements. PTO has made extensive use of interagency agreements, such as multiagency contracts and multiple award schedule transactions, that are designed to streamline the acquisition of goods and services by using contracts established by other agencies. PTO employs these interagency agreements to have other agencies use their contractors to purchase both IT and non-IT goods and services for PTO. As part of a Department-wide review of the use of interagency agreements by Commerce bureaus, the OIG evaluated PTO's policies, procedures, and practices for its use of interagency agreements, multiagency contracts, multiple agency schedule contract transactions, and other special agreements issued from August 1994 to March 1997. These agreements totaled $49.4 million in PTO obligations and only $27,000 from other agencies. We found that PTO did not adequately plan and manage many of its earlier IT interagency transactions. We later observed that PTO had taken steps to implement stricter procedures and better management for its agreements. PTO also significantly reduced its use of agreements, and currently has listed only $4.7 million in IT interagency agreements. Specifically we found that: l  PTO did not comply with some procurement laws, regulations, and best practices governing multiagency contracts and multiple award schedule transactions when using such transactions to support its IT development efforts.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  61   Patent and Trademark Office l  All of the IT-related interagency agreements issued before February 1997 that we reviewed were missing fundamental documentation needed to ensure adequate control over the agreements. Moreover, lacking a formalized interagency agreement management process, PTO did not adequately control the activities of its largest multiagency contracts providing agency, GSA's Federal Systems Integration and Management Center. But since 1997, PTO has improved its management of IT interagency agreements. These improvements include better documentation and more proactive management, as well as a reduction in the use of interagency agreements in favor of a single competitively awarded multiple award task order contract. None of the non-IT agreements we examined were reviewed by the Department's Office of General Counsel for legal sufficiency. In addition, PTO had not conducted adequate analyses under the Economy Act to determine whether it was in the government's best interest to enter into agreements. PTO has since implemented guidelines that require General Counsel review of agreements before issuance. PTO is also preparing Economy Act determinations on those agreements subject to the act. The PTO database used to track both IT and non-IT interagency agreements was inadequate at the time of our review. Since then, PTO has established a comprehensive database. The Department lacked policies and procedures for multiagency and multiple award schedule interagency transactions. The needed guidance should specify qualitative standards of documentation and minimum review thresholds.  l  l  l  We made recommendations to PTO and the Department to resolve our concerns, recognizing that since 1997, PTO had taken a number of measures that greatly improved its use and oversight of interagency and other special agreements. In response to our report, PTO officials generally agreed with our findings and reiterated the changes that it has made in its policies and procedures since 1997. The Department's Office of General Counsel agreed that better management of agreements and legal review will improve the agreements process. And the Department's Office of Executive Assistance Management agreed to lead an effort with the Office of Acquisition Management to prepare and issue a handbook detailing departmental policies and procedures for interagency agreements. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-10728) 62 Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Technology Administration Grant Process Designed to Promote Merit-Based Funding Decisions, but Needs More Discipline The OIG conducted an audit of the FY 1995 through 1997 criteria, procedures, and practices for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting applications for financial assistance under NIST's State Technology Extension Program. The program provides financial assistance, through cooperative agreements, to state governments and non-profit organizations to help states develop manufacturing assistance programs aimed at small and medium-sized manufacturers, and to help bring those state programs to a performance level where they can provide the full range of manufacturing extension services required by manufacturers. NIST administers the program through its Manufacturing Extension Partnership office. The OIG began an audit of NIST's criteria, procedures, and practices for the program in FY 1997, during which the agency made two awards of $100,000 each. NIST has not made any program awards since FY 1997 and does not anticipate any future solicitations, as it considers the nationwide network of manufacturing extension program centers to be complete. NIST had issued an open-ended solicitation for applications under the program in May 1995. After finding minor deficiencies in the solicitation, review, and selection processes for the FY 1997 awards, we expanded the scope of our review to include all program funding awarded under the original solicitation. NIST did not award program funding in FY 1995, but did make six awards totaling $552,000 in FY 1996. Our audit disclosed that although NIST developed and published appropriate evaluation criteria for its FY 1995-97 program competitions, it: l The Technology Administration serves the needs of technologybased industry, advocates federal actions and policies to speed the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace, and removes barriers for commercializing new technologies by industry. It includes three major organizations: Office of Technology Policy. OTP works to raise national awareness of the competitive challenge, promotes industry/government/ university partnerships, fosters quick commercialization of federal research results, promotes dedication to quality, increases industry's access to and participation in foreign research and development, and encourages the adoption of global standards. National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by working with industry to develop and apply technology, measurements, and standards. NIST manages four programs: the Advanced Technology Program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, a laboratory-based measurement and standards program, and the National Quality Program. National Technical Information Service. NTIS is a self-supporting agency that promotes the nation's economic growth and job creation by providing access to voluminous information that stimulates innovation and discovery. NTIS accomplishes this mission through two major programs: information collection and dissemination to the public, and information and production services to federal agencies.  Did not comply with the Department's requirement that a notice be placed in the Federal Register, at least annually, announcing the availability of funds and specifying the criteria and process to be used in selecting award recipients. Did not properly screen proposals for compliance with published funding and award period requirements. Could enhance the independence and objectivity of any future program competitions by using proposal reviewers from outside the program area.  l  l  We made several recommendations to address our concerns. NIST agreed with our findings and recommendations. (Business and Trade Audits Division: BTD-10961-9-0001) Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  63   Technology Administration Management of NTIS Agreements Requires Additional Improvements NTIS uses interagency and other special agreements to pursue its mission of being the federal government's central clearinghouse for unclassified scientific, technical, engineering, and other business-related information. Through such agreements, NTIS acquires information from federal agencies, government contractors, and foreign governmental sources. NTIS's collection of information exceeds 2.5 million works and includes business and management studies, research and development tools, and foreign and domestic trade statistics. As part of our Department-wide review of the use of such agreements, we evaluated the policies, practices, and procedures being followed by NTIS in preparing, reviewing, and managing its agreements. Overall, we found that NTIS properly uses agreements to support its mission. However, we identified several areas in need of improvement in the administration of agreements: l  Technology Administration  NIST  NTIS  Technology Policy  Processes and procedures covering agreements need improvement. The agency lacks written policies and procedures for drafting agreements and does not ensure that they undergo sufficient legal review. Interagency agreement files need to be consolidated and organized. NTIS maintains two separate sets of files for its interagency agreements, resulting in record-keeping problems in both sets and poor management of its projects. Agreements database needs to be improved. Its current agreements database is difficult to use and requires special effort to produce reports and other information on its agreements. Joint venture agreements need improvement. We identified two issues related to NTIS's joint venture agreements with private parties: First, the required business plans for joint ventures are inadequate and, in some cases, not prepared at all. Second, joint ventures are not being awarded through a process that adequately promotes competition.  l  l  l  We recommended that NTIS (1) develop comprehensive guidelines for preparing all types of agreements and work with the Department's Office of General Counsel to improve the legal review of agreements, (2) maintain one complete set of records for each agreement in one location, Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  64   Technology Administration (3) redesign its database to be more user-friendly, and (4) for joint ventures, create a comprehensive business plan for each project and develop a more formal awards process that ensures full competition and includes shorter agreement terms to further promote competition. NTIS generally agreed with the recommendations and has begun coordinating with the Office of General Counsel on the legal review of agreements. (Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations: IPE-11021)  NIST's Policy of Allowing Employees to Bring Firearms onto Its Campus Was Ill-Advised During our ongoing review of NIST's plans for a proposed ballistics testing facility and firearms qualification range on its Gaithersburg campus, we became aware of a related issue--a NIST policy that allowed employees to bring their recreational weapons onto the campus. Since at least 1975, NIST has granted some of its employees and contractors permits to bring weapons and ammunition onto its Gaithersburg campus for their personal, off-duty, and off-campus use. Weapons approved include various models of hunting rifles, shotguns, handguns, bows and arrows, martial arts weaponry, and assorted types of ammunition. Under the policy, the weapons were to be kept unloaded, encased (if handguns), secured in the employees' vehicles, and not removed while on the campus. In June 1999, when we conducted our review, about 20 employees and contractors had NIST permits to carry personal weapons and ammunition onto the campus. In a June 2, 1999, memorandum, we recommended that NIST cease allowing its employees to carry weapons or ammunition onto its Gaithersburg campus, unless the carrying of weapons is directly related to their official duties, and cancel all permits. As our memo pointed out, in addition to concerns about the appropriateness of this policy in terms of safety, liability, and potential adverse publicity, this practice was in apparent violation of federal criminal law, 18 U.S.C.  930, which generally prohibits the possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons in a federal facility. Although NIST officials disagreed that the carrying of weapons on the campus was prohibited by law, they agreed, on the basis of policy considerations, to stop issuing new permits and cancel all existing permits.

The program, administered by the Office of Executive Budgeting and Assistance Management (OEBAM), offers college students the opportunity to obtain paid internships at the Department. During FYs 1997 and 1998, the program funded six new and two amended awards, totaling more than $2.4 million. Our audit disclosed that OEBAM developed merit-based evaluation criteria for evaluating applications for FY 1998 awards. It also properly published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting applications for funding and further publicized the program through an announcement on its web site and other means. However, OEBAM: l  Budget  Financial Management  Management and Organization  Human Resources Management  Acquisition Management  Civil Rights  Administrative Operations  Small and Disadvantaged Business Util.

Had not properly documented its procedures for reviewing and selecting applications for FY 1998 awards in a formal policy statement or manual. Had not ensured that the program was included in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance for FY 1998.  l  l  We recommended that the Department document and disseminate program procedures for the review and selection of applications in a written policy statement, and consider including individuals from outside the Department on its review panels in order to enhance the independence of application reviews. The Department agreed with our recommendations and plans to develop a written policy statement detailing the program's review and selection procedures. In addition, the policy statement will include procedures to invite individuals from outside the Department to participate on program review panels. The Department also ensured that the program is now included in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. (Business and Trade Audits Division: BTD-11822-9-0001)  66  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Departmental Management Natural Disaster Reduction Initiative Is on Target, but Needs Better Reporting In December 1996, the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council's Subcommittee on Natural Disaster Reduction established its national initiative for an interagency approach for the strategic coordination and advancement of programs, strategies, and research to reduce the social, environmental, and economic costs of natural disasters. Along with the Department of Commerce, the initiative included the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Science Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In February 1998, the Department established its own initiative and a strategic framework for Commerce partnerships in natural disaster reduction. The Commerce strategy primarily involves the coordinated efforts of NOAA, NIST, EDA, and BXA, with support from other bureaus. A NOAA senior scientist serves as the Department's principal contact for the initiative and is the chairman of the Council subcommittee. The OIG completed an audit survey to determine what the bureaus have done in responding to the Department's initiative, assess the progress made, and identify and recommend changes for improvement. We found that the Commerce initiative was in consonance with the overall natural disaster reduction plan. However, we noted that the initiative did not provide for individual bureaus to report to the Department on the accomplishment of established milestones and objectives. As a result, the Department would not have adequate feedback to determine if the initiative was being properly implemented and achieving the desired results. We recommended that the Department establish standard, periodic progress reports for the bureaus. The Department agreed with our recommendation, but expressed its belief that the reporting function should be housed in NOAA, which plays the lead role in the initiative. We concurred with that proposed course of action. (Science and Technology Audits Division: STD-11600-9-0001)  Verification of Centralized Trial-Balance System Data Supports Department's Assertion In connection with the audit of the Department's FY 1998 consolidated financial statements (see March 1999 issue, page 76), the OIG performed certain procedures to verify financial data for the General Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  67   Departmental Management Accounting Office and Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service. Our verification was conducted to evaluate the Department of Commerce's assertion that the summarized federal agencies' centralized trial-balance system data provided by Treasury was not consistent in all material respects with the Department's FY 1998 consolidated statements. Our findings were in agreement with the Department's assertion, identifying differences between the data and the consolidated statements. These differences existed because the data was due to Treasury before the Department finalized the consolidated statements. This is a direct result of the Department's decision to extend the timeline for submitting financial statements in order to receive an unqualified opinion on its consolidated balance sheet. (Financial Statements Audits Division: FSD-10899-9-0002)  Preaward Financial Assistance Screening We continue to work with the Office of the Executive Budgeting and Assistance Management, NOAA and NIST grant offices, and EDA program offices to screen all of the Department's grants, cooperative agreements, and loans before award. Our screening serves two purposes: It provides information on whether the applicant has unresolved audit findings and recommendations on earlier awards, and it determines whether a name check or investigation has revealed any negative history on individuals or organizations connected with a proposed award. During this period, we screened 1,563 proposed awards. On 33 of the awards, we found major deficiencies that could affect the ability of the proposed recipients to maintain proper control over federal funds. On the basis of the information we provided, the Department delayed the awards until concerns were satisfactorily resolved, established special award conditions to adequately safeguard federal funds, or designated certain recipients as ""high risk"" and required that disbursement of federal funds be on a cost reimbursement basis, rather than allowing the awardees to draw upon the funds at will.

Normally, the federal agency providing the most direct funding to an entity is designated as its cognizant agency. OMB has designated Commerce as the cognizant agency for 280 economic development districts, as well as a number of state and local government units. From time to time, the Department also has oversight responsibilities for other recipient organizations. The Department has authorized the OIG to negotiate indirect cost rates and review cost allocation plans on its behalf. The OIG reviews and approves the methodology and principles used in pooling indirect costs and establishing an appropriate base for distributing those costs to ensure that each federal, state, and local program bears its fair share. During this period, we negotiated six indirect cost rate agreements with non-profit organizations and governmental agencies, and reviewed and approved eight cost allocation plans. We also provided technical assistance to recipients of Commerce awards regarding the use of rates established by other federal agencies and their applicability to our awards. Further, we have worked closely with first-time for-profit recipients of Commerce awards to establish indirect cost proposals that are acceptable for OIG review. ( Atlanta Regional Office of Audits)  Nonfederal Audit Activities In addition to OIG-performed audits, certain of the Department's financial assistance programs are sometimes audited by state and local government auditors and by independent public accountants. OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, sets forth the requirements for most of these audits. Forprofit organizations that receive ATP funds from NIST are audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and NIST ProgramSpecific Audit Guidelines for ATP Cooperative Agreements, issued by the Department. (Before June 30, 1996, such audits were subject to the requirements of Circular A-128, Audits of State and Local Governments, and the former Circular A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions. Some of the audits discussed below were conducted in accordance with these earlier circulars.)

We will discuss this matter in the March 2000 issue as part of our financial statement audit reporting.  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  71   Reporting Requirements Section 4(a)(2): Review of Legislation and Regulations This section requires the Inspector General of each agency to review existing and proposed legislation and regulations relating to that agency's programs and operations. Based on that review, the Inspector General is required to make recommendations in the semiannual report concerning the impact of such legislation or regulations on the economy and efficiency in the administration of programs and operations administered or financed by the agency or on the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in those programs and operations. Our comments concerning legislative and regulatory initiatives affecting Commerce programs are discussed in appropriate sections of the report.  Section 5(a)(3): Prior Significant Recommendations Unimplemented This section requires an identification of each significant recommendation described in previous semiannual reports on which corrective action has not been completed. Section 5(b) requires that the Secretary transmit to the Congress statistical tables for audit reports for which no final action has been taken, plus a statement that includes an explanation of the reasons final action has not been taken on each such audit report, except when the management decision was made within the preceding year. To include a list of all significant unimplemented recommendations in this report would be duplicative, unwieldy, and of limited value to the Congress. Any list would have meaning only if explanations detailed whether adequate progress is being made to implement each agreed-upon corrective action. Also, as this semiannual report is being prepared, management is in the process of updating the Department's Audit Tracking System as of September 30, 1999, based on semiannual status reports due from the bureaus in mid-October. An accurate database is therefore not available to the OIG for reference here. However, additional information on the status of any audit recommendations may be obtained through the OIG's Office of Audits.  72  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Reporting Requirements Sections 5(a)(5) and 6(b)(2): Information or Assistance Refused These sections require a summary of each report to the Secretary when access, information, or assistance has been unreasonably refused or not provided. There were no such instances during this semiannual period, and no reports to the Secretary.  Section 5(a)(10): Prior Audit Reports Unresolved This section requires a summary of each audit report issued before the beginning of the reporting period for which no management decision has been made by the end of the reporting period (including the date and title of each such report), an explanation of the reasons such management decision has not been made, and a statement concerning the desired timetable for achieving a management decision on each such report. As of September 30, 1999, nine performance audits and one financial assistance audit were in this category, as discussed below. Performance Audits The nine NOAA unresolved reports address the bureau's discretionary funding programs, its light aircraft operations, and NMFS's laboratory structure. These reports are discussed on page 54. Financial Assistance Audit The unresolved audit relates to EDA. A response to the final audit the OIG is awaiting the submission Additional details are presented on a financial assistance award made by report has been submitted; however, of an audit resolution proposal. page 23.  Section 5(a)(11): Significant Revised Management Decisions This section requires a description and explanation of the reasons for any significant revised management decision made during the reporting period. Department Administrative Order 213-5, Audit Resolution and Follow-up, provides procedures for revision of a management decision. For performance audits, the OIG must be consulted and must approve, in advance, any modification to an audit action plan. For financial assistance audits, the OIG must concur with any decision that would change the audit resolution proposal in response to an appeal by the recipient. Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999  73   Reporting Requirements The decisions issued on the four appeals of audit-related debts were finalized with the full participation and concurrence of the OIG.  Section 5(a)(12): Significant Management Decisions with Which the OIG Disagreed This section requires information concerning any significant management decision with which the Inspector General is in disagreement. Department Administrative Order 213-5 provides procedures for the elevation of unresolved audit recommendations to higher levels of Department and OIG management, including an Audit Resolution Council. During this period, no audit issues were referred to the Council.  74  Commerce OIG Semiannual Report September 1999   Statistical Highlights Audit Statistical Highlights Questioned costs this period ...........................................

GX021-46-4981596	"Appendix C. Goals and Targets of the National Earthquake Loss Reduction Program (NEP)      The National Earthquake Strategy Working Group recognized that NEHRP lacked an effective means of coordinating non-NEHRP agencies' earthquake activities, as well as efforts of non-governmental and state and local governmental sectors dealing with earthquakes. A major difficulty in evaluating the success of NEHRP and identifying future priorities has been the lack of specific goals, targets, and products against which performance can be measured or expectations revised. The new strategy establishes specific integrated and coordinated research targets and associated products with timelines for completion. Though these targets will undoubtedly be revised, modified, and supplemented as more is learned about earthquake loss reduction, they provide a framework for measuring progress.     The following sections set forth the primary goals that define the strategy. Each goal has several targets which in some cases could be described as projects, but generally are more broadly based. While the targets are prioritized in order of decreasing importance, the goals are not. For most targets one or more products have been identified. The aim of the strategy is to maintain a focus on these products as the separate supporting projects are developed, conducted, reviewed, and completed so that information and technology transfer meets public expectations on national earthquake loss reduction. Consistent with their mission, the Federal agencies planning allocation of limited earthquake-designated resources will take into account the specific targets and products identified as high priority issues by the user community in both the public and private sectors. The dates suggested for meeting targets or completing products are estimated guidelines, not commitments.     Funds for the attainment of these goals are presumed to be limited to those currently in the budgets of agency programs involved in earthquake research or loss mitigation technology development.   Goal 1: Provide leadership and coordination of federal earthquake research    Targets:   1. Work with the National Science and Technology Council to establish a leadership mechanism to assure implementation of the Strategy. The mechanism shall report every two years to the President and to the Congress on its findings, progress, and recommendations relating to earthquake risk reduction. Leadership mechanisms are needed for both national oversight and day-to-day coordination functions.     2. Integrate federal earthquake-related program planning into the new mechanism over a five year period beginning in Fiscal Year 1996. This shall include a detailed analysis during FY 1996 of agency expenditures and planned expenditures with the objective of identifying any redundancies and redirecting expenditures toward high priority targets.     3. Develop a balanced national prioritized research and mitigation agenda, confirmed or adjusted on a regular basis, incorporating a broad-based assessment of user needs that includes the needs of agencies to support special or unique missions.     4. Facilitate cooperation and leverage across all agencies and groups with programmatic interests in earthquake loss reduction, including, but not limited to federal, state, local, private, voluntary, and public utility agencies and groups.     5. Develop an overall nationwide strategic plan to integrate and coordinate existing but currently separate research and mitigation programs into a unified, needs-driven, goal-oriented program consistent with the National Earthquake Strategy goals.     6. Advocate policies and practices nationwide and recommend legislation as appropriate.     7. Conduct a biennial performance assessment and report of coordination and integration activities under the Program. This report shall include accomplishments towards achieving the goals and recommendations for improving the Strategy. As the Program matures the assessment and report can be conducted at less frequent intervals.     8.

The bureau has generally concurred with our observations and recommendations. It has also provided additional comments, which were considered and, where appropriate, were reflected in the final report. The Bureau's comments are attached as appendix I. Our annotated response to the Bureau's comments is attached as appendix II. Because the recommendations have not yet been fully implemented, the bureau must follow normal procedures in submitting an audit action plan within 60 days. We thank Census Bureau staff for the assistance and courtesies extended to us during our review. If you have any questions, please contact me at 202-482-4661 or Mort Schwartz, Director, Economics and Statistics Audits Division, at 202-482-8248. SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS The 2000 decennial census program to improve coverage of the hard-to-enumerate by targeting questionnaires in multiple languages may not be necessary and may compromise the bureau's ability to achieve its stated goals of increasing accuracy and containing costs. The program may be unnecessary because the bureau has made sampling an integral part of its 2000 design to compensate for ineffective coverage improvement programs used in past censuses. Further, the 1995 Census Test results indicated that targeted questionnaire program components (targeted mailings of questionnaires in English and Spanish and targeting areas with blank census forms in multiple languages) did not increase response rates for the intended populations. Although specific program details are not yet in place, if, as is likely, the program grows significantly, it would result in a substantial increase in workload, and could hinder completing nonresponse follow-up on schedule. According to decennial managers, the limited time to complete nonresponse follow-up is the single biggest risk in the census. The nonresponse followup must be completed before certain key operations of the Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM)--the large independent survey intended to locate and correct for those not counted in the census--can proceed. Delaying these operations could compromise delivery of the apportionment counts to the President by the legal deadline.   While acknowledging these limitations, bureau managers have identified the goal of promoting partnerships as necessary for expanding the number of languages included, suggesting that measures of cost effectiveness are less important. Given the bureau managers' intensive efforts to communicate and implement partnerships, community leaders are likely to expect to play a significant role in determining the program's ultimate scope and nature. In light of past experience, local officials will probably advocate an expansive program. Unless costeffectiveness is a fundamental criterion, program cost growth is likely. We recommend that the bureau define a comprehensive targeted questionnaire program, keeping in mind the interdependent effects on cost, schedule, performance, and public perception. Furthermore, the bureau should discuss the program details and justification with local partners as soon as possible. INTRODUCTION The Census Bureau, in consultation with expert advisory panels, ""reengineered"" census-taking methods to meet the challenges of accurately and cost-effectively counting an increasingly hardto-count population in 2000. An accurate census is crucial because the Constitution requires that it be used to apportion the Congress. Additionally, census data are used for a host of other important activities, including federal and state redistricting, the implementation and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, and the distribution of billions of dollars of federal and state funds each year. Because of its centrality to decisions that last 10 years, the bureau must address concerns about the content and method of conducting the census raised by federal, state, and local governments and a myriad of advocacy groups whose constituents are affected by census results. The 1990 census was long, expensive, and labor-intensive, a situation exacerbated by a lowerthan-expected public response. Because of the low response, the bureau required additional appropriations from the Congress during the census to complete the count. Despite the census' higher cost, post-analysis concluded that its accuracy decreased. Particularly alarming to the Congress and other stakeholders was the increase in the differential undercount over past censuses; that is, of people missed in the census, a disproportionate number were minorities, who were often poor, urban, and facing language barriers. The Congress convened a panel of experts from the National Academy of Sciences to address these problems. In 1994, the panel concluded that to contain cost and increase accuracy, the bureau should use statistical sampling and estimation as an integral part of the 2000 census design. In addition, the panel concluded that the bureau should rethink and reengineer the entire census process and operations. The National Academy stated that the highly labor-intensive enumeration techniques for follow-up and coverage improvement added in recent decades to increase census participation did not increase accuracy. For example, late in the 1980 and 1990 censuses, the bureau initiated a ""Were You Counted?"" program that attempted to find nonrespondents who were likely to be undercounted. The program introduced many errors into the census count.  2   The National Academy concluded that traditional counting methods alone are not sufficient, and in some cases only marginally effective. Bureau officials agreed and decided to incorporate statistical sampling and estimation into the design to accomplish two things: (1) reduce the nonresponse workload (to contain cost and save time) by enumerating only a sample of nonrespondents and estimating the rest, and (2) increase accuracy (improve coverage of the hard-to-count) by conducting a large independent survey, the ICM survey, as a quality check of the census. A major challenge in 2000 is completing census operations in time to conduct the ICM survey and process its results by the December 31 deadline. To help address this challenge, the bureau adopted a strategy to make it easier for people to be counted. This strategy will be implemented using several new methods, including multiple mailings of questionnaires and notices about the census, targeted mailing packages to households that include questionnaires in both English and a second language (e.g., Spanish), questionnaire assistance and response by telephone in multiple languages and at Questionnaire Assistance Centers, and making blank questionnaires widely available in up to 32 languages in addition to English. If these new methods increase response rates, they will reduce the number of nonresponding households, thereby reducing the number of expensive field visits required during sampling. The sampling of nonrespondents will require visits to approximately 22 million households, assuming a mail response rate of 66.9 percent, and must be completed in about six weeks. The new methods were included in the 1995 Census Test, an operational test of over a dozen potential new census components in three sites, and will be used in the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal, a dry run of the census in three new sites next year. Another strategy for Census 2000 is to build partnerships at every stage of the process with state, local, and tribal governments; community-based and other organizations; and the private sector. The bureau believes that such partnerships are valuable because local officials and community leaders understand and know their communities, and can therefore help to tailor plans for conducting the census. Local and tribal governments will have the opportunity to review, confirm, and augment the list of neighborhoods identified for targeting methods, including mailings of a second language questionnaire to accompany the English ones, and for distributing blank questionnaires, called Be Counted forms, in multiple languages. Additionally, community-based organizations and local governments will help the bureau to identify strategic and high-visibility locations to serve as Be Counted questionnaire distribution sites. To help determine which areas need which targeted methods, the bureau intends to develop a planning database containing 1990 census data and selection criteria for identifying appropriate targeted methods. For example, a prototype of the database was used in the 1995 Census Test to select linguistically isolated areas, defined as areas in which residents do not speak English well, to receive targeted mailing packages that included both Spanish and English questionnaires.  3   PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF AUDIT The initial objective of our review was to evaluate the status of the decennial questionnaire design and to identify any deficiencies affecting other interdependent components, such as questionnaire production schedules and data capture. During our field work, we found that some of the concerns about questionnaire design readiness that prompted our review had been reduced as the design for the dress rehearsal evolved. However, we also found that the targeted program for mailing joint English and Spanish questionnaire packages had been expanded to include additional languages and that the Be Counted program, originally scheduled to be completed before the nonresponse follow-up process begins, had been extended through the end of that process. Moreover, we discovered that both programs were still in the conceptual stage. Consequently, we focused on targeted mailings and the Be Counted program, which for simplicity we will refer to jointly as the ""targeted questionnaire program,"" and the effects of program expansion on the census design's cost, schedule, performance, and public perception. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed test plans and evaluations, related contracting documents, advisory panel documentation, decision memoranda, congressional correspondence, and other internal and external documents concerning the targeted questionnaire program. We also analyzed relevant information on current and planned decennial activities and the relationships among them residing in the Decennial Master Activity Schedule, the primary project management tool for the 2000 census, and the decennial cost model. Specifically, in reviewing the schedule, we examined targeted questionnaire-related activities and the adequacy of the linkages among them. We discussed the results with cognizant officials, including the bureau's Deputy Director and its Associate Director for Decennial Census. For the cost model, we reviewed the assumptions and the currently attributed cost components for the targeted questionnaire program and compared this information to recent programmatic changes. For this limited review, we did not examine the bureau's internal controls, nor did we rely on computer-generated data. All interviews were conducted at the Census Bureau's offices in Suitland, Maryland. We conducted our field work from June through August 1997. The audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and performed under the authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, and Department Organization Order 10-13, as amended.1 TARGETED QUESTIONNAIRE PROGRAM MAY NOT BE NECESSARY The 2000 census plan is designed to meet the competing goals of increasing accuracy and containing costs by replacing unsystematic, error-prone, 1990-style coverage improvement programs with carefully planned and executed statistical methods. This premise is consistent with both the National Academy of Sciences' conclusions and the bureau's 1995 Census Test results. Specifically, the bureau plans to increase census accuracy by reducing the differential  The OIG notes that audit team members accepted positions with the Census Bureau following completion of the audit field work and this report; however, the OIG has determined that the audit was conducted and reported with full independence and impartiality.  1  4   undercount through the ICM survey, the independent quality control check to be conducted at the end of the enumeration. The bureau will contain cost by sampling nonrespondents instead of conducting a 100 percent follow-up, which would require implementing expensive, hard-tocontrol, and error-prone coverage improvement programs. The 1995 Test included a targeted Spanish questionnaire mailing and Be Counted questionnaires in English, Spanish, Tagalog (a language spoken in the Philippines), Chinese, and Vietnamese, to support the objective of increasing response rates, and decreasing the differential undercount. In the targeted mailing test, questionnaires in English and in Spanish were mailed to areas that the 1990 census indicated had high (more than 30 percent) and moderately high (between 15 and 30 percent) levels of Spanish linguistic isolation. Response rates in the targeted areas were lower than expected, suggesting that mailing forms in Spanish did not increase response rates. However, because of limitations in the test design, the bureau could not determine definitively whether the use of Spanish questionnaires raised response rates over what they would have been if only an English questionnaire had been used. However, the test did enable the bureau to conclude that the percentage of targeted households returning questionnaires in Spanish did not vary by the level of the neighborhood's linguistic isolation. Bureau analysts and the National Academy of Sciences concluded that either linguistic isolation is not a good predictor of the usefulness of the Spanish-language questionnaire or the 1990 data were out of date by 1995, which suggests that they will be even less useful in 2000. Despite the Be Counted program's emphasis on increasing the participation of people who do not speak English well, the 1995 Census Test results indicate that the program did not achieve that goal. The bureau placed Be Counted forms at 646 sites, of which almost half were targeted at linguistic minorities. The overall response to the campaign was low. The bureau processed 4,596 completed Be Counted forms, representing 0.7 percent of the total population. However, of these, only 1,698 included people clearly not already counted. Additionally, over 42 percent of those forms were completed or received via the bureau's telephone assistance line, meaning that the 646 sites yielded only a little more than 1,000 returned forms. Further, only one-fifth of the completed Be Counted forms in the 1995 Census Test sites were printed in languages other than English. Finally, all 215 of the Asian language Be Counted forms returned to the bureau were completed in English. Analysis of the language in which Spanish forms were completed is not available. The National Academy concluded that the Be Counted program did not achieve the goal of improving coverage of groups traditionally undercounted in the census and that it should therefore be reduced. Of the 1,698 Be Counted forms added, 176 were from housing units that did not receive a questionnaire in the mail because their addresses were not in the Master Address File (MAF). However, because these people did not receive a mailed questionnaire, and overall participation was low, their addition did not result in the significant duplication problem that would have occurred if people in already counted housing units had responded in large numbers. Bureau analysts attributed this success to the campaign's short duration and close proximity (within  5   three weeks) to Census Day. They concluded that limiting the availability of the Be Counted forms to one month after Census Day and to a relatively small number of distribution sites may minimize multiple responses for Census 2000. Despite the National Academy's recommendations that coverage improvement programs be reduced, the bureau's justification of sampling as an alternative to them, and its own test results, bureau managers have decided not only to continue, but to expand, the targeted questionnaire program. In addition to Spanish and English, forms will be mailed in selected Asian and other languages; Be Counted will include up to 32 languages at an undetermined number of sites; and it will continue during nonresponse follow-up. Although bureau managers recognize the limitations discussed above, they justify the continuation and expansion of the program in terms of the new, less quantifiable goal of promoting local partnerships, indicating that cost effectiveness was not a primary consideration. Specifically, the Associate Director for Decennial Census stated that the targeted mailings were expanded to address concerns expressed by one of the advisory committees. When asked about the policy to extend the Be Counted program, he stated that the intent was only to accept Be Counted forms until the end of nonresponse follow-up, but not to extend the program, for example, by continuing to promote it and make forms available. However, he also acknowledged that such an approach may make it very difficult to end the program because of the perception that there is still an opportunity to be counted. Unfortunately, even if cost is not a major consideration, the performance pitfalls of full program implementation may outweigh projected gains in public approval. FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TARGETED QUESTIONNAIRE PROGRAM COULD BECOME COUNTERPRODUCTIVE Many details of the 2000 targeted questionnaire program, including its size, are not yet defined. However, a more expansive scenario appears consistent with bureau and stakeholder expectations. We define ""full program implementation"" as mailing questionnaires in one of five or more non-English languages and placing Be Counted forms in one or more of up to 32 languages at hundreds of thousands of locations for the duration of census-taking operations. Given the low 1995 Census Test response rates, targeting mailed questionnaires in several languages and placing Be Counted forms in multiple languages at public sites during census taking may appear to be either a positive or neutral way to improve the response rate of the hardto-count population. However, implementation of this plan could jeopardize both data quality and an already tenuous strategy for completing basic census-taking operations in time to conduct the ICM survey, without which the undercount will not be corrected. Using the ""long form"" questionnaire, the Census Bureau plans to collect more detailed data from a one-in-six sample of the population. The additional information from the long form is needed for a myriad of uses. The poor quality of long form data from hard-to-count areas and small population subgroups has been a longstanding concern of the bureau's advisory committees. In fact, the bureau initiated the targeted mailings in Asian and possibly other languages in order to address this concern. However, the Be Counted form's wide availability--in any language--may 6   provide an unintended incentive to substitute this form, which contains only ""short form"" information and takes a fraction of the time to complete, for a long form received at one's home. The bureau's plans for 2000 do not include any follow-up of households that complete a Be Counted form in lieu of a long form. Depending on the extent of substitution occurring in subpopulation groups, data quality could further decline. How this approach will affect data quality is unknown; however, extending the Be Counted program could jeopardize the bureau's attempt to complete the census in time for the ICM survey. According to the Decennial Master Activity Schedule and bureau managers responsible for field operations, all activities intended to reduce the nonresponse field visit workload--multiple questionnaire mailings, questionnaire assistance and response by telephone and at Questionnaire Assistance Centers, and the availability of Be Counted forms--should be completed and all respondent information should be processed before nonresponse follow-up begins. Completion of such steps is needed to ensure that nonrespondents are properly identified and a sample selected for follow-up. The implication is that responses received after the nonresponse sample is drawn have arrived too late to prevent a personal follow-up visit. A similar requirement is in place for the conclusion of the nonresponse follow-up phase, where the file containing all processed census responses for a given area is completed, allowing the ICM survey to begin. The strict cut-off of questionnaire processing before the ICM survey begins is designed to ensure both the statistical validity of the ICM survey interview process and sufficient time to process and match the results of the two operations. The targeted language mailings strain the schedule because additional time is needed to manually transcribe questionnaires in languages other than English and Spanish before they can be electronically processed. The translation process may be carried out in locations away from the processing centers, creating logistical difficulties that the bureau has not yet addressed. Therefore, the amount of additional time required to fully process targeted questionnaires is not yet accounted for in the Master Activity Schedule. An expanded Be Counted program potentially would have even more severe consequences. First, multiple response modes generally complicate and increase field operations, data processing, matching and unduplication of forms, and sample selection for nonresponse followup. The steps required in the 1995 Census Test to accommodate the use of Be Counted forms, in addition to the traditional mailing, provide an illustrative example. When Be Counted forms were returned, they first were processed and checked for duplication. This process of checking for duplicates required the bureau to assign to each form a unique geographical identification number designating a specific spatial location. If the Be Counted form represented people in a housing unit not on the MAF, the address was verified by a field visit, enumeration was completed if necessary, the address was added to the MAF, and the housing unit was treated as a responding address. The Be Counted forms were designed to accommodate both individuals and whole households who believed that they were missed, and to be able to distinguish between the two circumstances. When the only response from an existing unit was a Be Counted form that indicates a response for the entire household, it was treated like a questionnaire received in the mail. However, if the only response from a household was a Be Counted form representing less 7   than the full household, that housing unit became part of the nonresponse universe. If this unit was selected as part of the nonresponse follow-up sample, it was counted during nonresponse follow-up. If the unit was not in the sample, it was treated like any other nonresponding unit not in the sample, i.e., its persons and characteristics were estimated based on the units that were in the sample; thus, partial household information was not used in the 1995 Census Test. In the dress rehearsal and the 2000 census, the bureau will have to implement the additional step of translating the Be Counted forms completed in languages other than English or Spanish, as with the targeted mailed questionnaires. Despite the complexities inherent with the introduction of the Be Counted program, their impact on operations would be limited by the program's completion before nonresponse follow-up. Second, extending the Be Counted program beyond nonresponse follow-up means that the complexities and increased workload discussed above will be exacerbated. As mentioned earlier, decennial managers believe that the limited period available to complete nonresponse follow-up in time to conduct the ICM survey is the single biggest risk in the census. Bureau officials have stated that any significant deviation from the expected workload could compromise delivery of the apportionment counts to the President by the legal deadline-December 31, 2000. The extended duration of the Be Counted program is likely to increase the expected workload, especially if local efforts to increase the count result in unexpectedly large influxes of Be Counted forms in as many as 32 languages. The bureau's sampling plan consists of estimating 10 percent of the population (over 12 million housing units) based on the responses of the first 90 percent. Due to the assumptions underlying sampling, once the sample of nonrespondents is selected, those not in the sample cannot later be included, or the results could be biased. Local officials, who would not likely have access to the bureau's sampling lists, may encourage some percentage of those people living in the more than 12 million housing units to complete a Be Counted form. In response to congressional concerns about forms returned late that are not part of the sample for nonresponse follow-up, bureau managers have stated that they would be used in the census. Therefore, unlike in the 1995 Census Test, Be Counted forms received during nonresponse follow-up will have to be used in a yet-to-be-defined way. It is not obvious how that information could be added to the census directly without violating fundamental sampling assumptions, biasing the results. The bureau may wish to use the information to help estimate the nonresponding, nonsampled housing units. To date, a final decision on how the data will be used has not been made. EMPHASIS ON TARGETED QUESTIONNAIRE PARTNERSHIP AND LACK OF DETAILS CAST UNCERTAINTY ON PROGRAM COST While program details for 2000 are still pending, bureau managers have put significant effort into promoting the targeted questionnaire partnership concept. These efforts include conferences with governmental and non-governmental entities, the establishment of a regional staff and local 8   infrastructure to support efforts, and a nationwide campaign by top bureau officials to promote partnerships. In the past, local officials have strongly advocated for using any means available for increasing their population counts. The current emphasis on partnerships and empowerment could result in even greater advocacy by local officials of an expanded program. When asked about the cost effectiveness of either the targeted language mailing or the Be Counted program in multiple languages, the Associate Director for Decennial Census stated that moving toward the goal of promoting partnerships, not improving the response and cost, was the deciding factor. He further stated that preliminary estimates of the cost of expanding languages should only modestly increase the total program cost currently reflected in the decennial cost model. However, the decennial cost model estimate is based on an incomplete set of program components, yielding a cost figure that may not be consistent with either program expansion or partners' expectations. For example, the cost model assumes a single drop-off of 50 Be Counted forms at each of 280,000 sites (an average of 7 sites per local jurisdiction) and a single pick-up of the unused forms. Such a scenario is inconsistent with plans for the dress rehearsal, in which the bureau will make re-stocking visits, as needed, to all libraries, post offices, departments of motor vehicles, and additional targeted sites. The process to determine the size of the 2000 targeted questionnaire program has not progressed because staff attention is focused on preparing for the dress rehearsal, which they are viewing as a separate process that may not employ the same criteria as the 2000 census. Among the key decisions that will significantly affect cost, yet have not been addressed, are: C C C C the number of languages and areas for targeted mailings, the number of languages, forms, and sites for Be Counted, the percentage of 39,000 local governments and other community leaders to involve in reviewing bureau plans, and the intensity of effort required to exchange information with local partners.  The myriad of additional assumptions that will affect cost, such as the percentage of Be Counted forms returned to the bureau, are themselves dependent on pending program details. Current cost model parameters seem even less adequate with the recent decision to extend the duration of the Be Counted program for 2000. Therefore, the cost estimate is likely to change because bureau officials are just beginning to develop program details for 2000. Another area of uncertainty is the targeted questionnaire program's dependence on other programs that are not yet in place. Bureau managers recognize the need to organize planning in this area quickly, given that some aspects need to be implemented within the next year. For example, beginning in July 1998, regional office officials are expected to begin an approximately seven-month local review of areas identified for various targeted methods. This review is to serve the dual purposes of promoting partnerships and updating the 1990 census data 9   that make up the planning database. The bureau will inform local partners of the areas selected for targeted methods and have them react by indicating that they (1) agree with the areas and methods, (2) have identified new areas that also should be targeted, or (3) have identified areas that have changed and no longer meet particular criteria. To carry out this activity, the bureau must fully implement the planning database on a national level, include all selection criteria so that areas and methods can be identified, and train regional office staff in interpreting and modifying the database. The implementation team does not yet exist, and several key issues have not been addressed, such as the conditions under which local information will be accepted and the technical manner in which it will be incorporated. Additionally, because linguistic isolation did not perform well as an indicator for targeted language mailings, the Language Determination Team is just beginning work on identifying additional indicators that will help determine how many areas will receive targeted questionnaires. Given that the current cost model does not include all of the elements identified by program managers, let alone those details not yet identified, cost estimates are likely to increase. However, it is not clear how the program's cost could rise much given that senior bureau managers have established a $4 billion ceiling for the decennial census, other programs areas are struggling to stay within budget, and any deviation from projections must be brought forward soon to ensure consideration in the bureau's fiscal year 1999 budget submission. WHETHER PLANNED OR UNPLANNED, COST GROWTH SEEMS LIKELY If the bureau continues to promote the targeted questionnaire program without stringent selection criteria, the program appears likely to grow in size and cost. The primary question may be whether the growth will occur early and therefore be planned or whether it will occur late and be minimally controlled. First, local officials may find narrow bureau criteria for targeting unacceptable during the local review phase next year and encourage the bureau to expand the program, or bureau officials may adopt broad criteria in anticipation of this difficulty. Second, the bureau may proceed with narrow criteria, but receive enormous pressure from local officials concerned about response rates during census implementation, and be forced to implement targeted efforts during the census. Although bureau managers recognize the need for selection criteria to manage the program, they limited their ability to develop objective criteria when they decided not to include cost and certain other effectiveness indicators. For example, since the 1995 Census Test's use of linguistic isolation was not a good indicator of effectiveness, the bureau will have difficulty defending any specific percentage threshold. Without quantifiable justification and local officials' incentives for maximum effort to ensure a complete count, it will be difficult to establish narrow selection criteria that will be widely accepted by local partners. Therefore, the bureau will find it difficult to refuse a request to expand the program, as evidenced by the expansion earlier this year of the targeted mailing component of Census 2000.  10   Additionally, bureau managers' decision to extend the Be Counted program by allowing forms to be accepted until the end of nonresponse follow-up in effect extends the full Be Counted program. Further expansion also appears likely once the local reviews begin in July 1998. The bureau's past experiences indicate that local officials will ask for additional efforts, and the partnership initiative provides them with a greater expectation that the bureau will heed their advice. On the other hand, if cost and associated schedule constraints contain program development, the resulting program will likely be modest. To control costs, bureau officials may not be able to respond to local requests, creating a potentially large discrepancy between what partners expect and what the bureau delivers. If the discrepancy is large, the goal of promoting partnerships to create a cooperative working environment could be damaged. Further, these unmet expectations could create intense pressure during the census to expand coverage improvement programs, especially as local problems are uncovered. The probability of this occurring in 2000 is greater than in past censuses because of another aspect of the partnership plan, whereby the bureau will provide local governments with real-time response rates to spur action in low-response areas. Program expansion at the last minute could require either additional funding from the Congress or a reduction in later operations, including sampling. Given its centrality to achieving the bureau's goal of an accurate count, this potential trade-off is of particular concern. CONCLUSIONS We recognize that partnerships with local governments can be a helpful way for the bureau to conduct the decennial census, including identifying the hard-to-count, such as those people who speak little or no English. However, partnerships and coverage improvement programs cannot replace statistical methods in containing costs and reducing the differential undercount--the impetus behind the reengineered design. We are concerned that using statistical methods to achieve the goals of increasing accuracy and containing costs may become subordinated to promoting partnerships. This could jeopardize the critical goal of keeping the nonresponse follow-up operations and workload as simple and light as possible. Given bureau managers' plans and intensive efforts to communicate how to implement partnerships, community leaders are likely to expect to play a significant role in finalizing the scope and method of implementing the targeted questionnaire program. Further, if the perceived public relations gain associated with such programs takes precedence over substantive cost, schedule, and performance concerns, the goals of cost containment and reducing the differential undercount could be compromised. For this reason, the bureau must move forward quickly to define the scope of the targeted questionnaire program and determine how it can and should be implemented. The bureau must balance cost, schedule, performance, and public perception concerns in performing that task. Bureau managers must communicate program plans and their justification to the local partners immediately because without the details, the partners' expectations about their roles in program planning and implementation may differ significantly from what is operationally desirable or 11   even feasible. The longer this discrepancy exists, the more likely it is that the desired cooperative environment will erode. We are not suggesting that the bureau abandon the targeted questionnaire partnership. Rather, the bureau should openly discuss with partners the research results indicating the limitations of the targeting initiatives and then design the program to complement, rather than compromise, a successful 2000 decennial census. RECOMMENDATIONS We recommend that the Director of the Bureau of the Census: 1. Design a comprehensive targeted questionnaire program, which considers cost, schedule, performance, and public perception constraints and trade-offs, including a. The effects on major census operations, such as delays in completing data processing, and The effects of other related programs, such as delays in developing the Planning Database or changes in the partnership program.  b.  2.  Communicate the targeted questionnaire program's scope and limitations to local partners in time to discuss and resolve concerns.  12      Appendix II  OIG Annotated Response to Census Bureau Comments on Specific Items in the OIG Draft Report 1. The Census Bureau is concerned that the report's combined treatment of the Be Counted program and the mailing of questionnaires in languages other than English may blur key distinctions between these programs. Although it may well affect the nonresponse followup workload, the Be Counted program is not designed to reduce that workload, per se. Rather, it provides a response method for individuals living in housing units that did not receive an initial or replacement questionnaire -- perhaps because their addresses were not included in the Master Address File (MAF). A second focus of the Be Counted program is to include individuals who do not live in a location with a ""regular address"" or who believe they were not counted in the census by other means. This includes individuals who were omitted in error from the questionnaire of the household where they live because of confusion about residency rules or for any other reason. Neither a housing unit omitted from the MAF nor a resident omitted from a completed questionnaire would be in the nonresponse follow-up universe, nor would their characteristics be estimated on the basis of census responses in the census tract where they live. OIG Response: We recognize the bureau's intent to limit the scope and duration of these programs. Our report emphasizes, however, that the intensive involvement of local partners, who have incentives to maximize their population counts, may result in expanded programs. Clearly, if the program is limited to the bureau's intent, the risks diminish enormously. 2. The Census Bureau has told the Congress that it will process all Census 2000 mail-out questionnaire returns received during nonresponse follow-up. Although we plan to withdraw Be Counted questionnaires from distribution by the start of the nonresponse follow-up field operation, we also plan to process late Be Counted returns we receive after that date As in 1990, we will attempt to remove housing units from the nonresponse follow-up assignment lists if their residents return a questionnaire during the days between generation of the nonresponse follow-up assignment lists and the sending of these lists to the local census offices. Despite these attempts, it is unavoidable that telephone responses, mail-out questionnaires, and Be Counted forms will be received from some housing units after nonresponse followup enumerator visits begin. Although details are being worked out, a computer edit based on the comprehensiveness of the responses provided will determine which information to tabulate in these situations. Late returns from housing units not in the nonresponse follow1   up sample will be incorporated in the census results during the estimation process. No responses received within the data collection period will be discarded in Census 2000. OIG Response: See Number 1. 3. The Census Bureau does not believe that the Be Counted program or the mailing of nonEnglish questionnaires will delay the beginning of the Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) Survey. The data collection phases of the ICM Survey are not dependent on the completion of a file of ""all processed census responses for a given area"" because census responses are no longer being loaded into the interviewers' laptop computers before they interview. That file is not needed until the census-ICM matching process takes place after the conclusion of both field operations, not before the beginning of ICM data collection. For example, the telephone interview phase of the ICM involving mail respondents will begin in advance of nonresponse follow-up operations in the same census tract because these interviews do not put both nonresponse follow-up and ICM interviewers in the same census tract at the same time. Field interviews in ICM clusters will begin as soon as a census tract reaches the required nonresponse follow-up completion level based on its sampling rate. OIG Response: We agree that the program is not likely to delay the start of the ICM, rather the conduct, as stated on page 6. Therefore, we clarified the wording in the paragraph. 4. The Census Bureau first used the Census 2000 Planning Database to help select Be Counted distribution locations in the 1995 Census Test. Other sources of information included the knowledge of local partners, as well as a Census Bureau field staff ""windshield survey"" of the proposed locations. Beginning with evaluations from the 1995 Census Test, the Census Bureau has been refining its original distribution strategy. OIG Response: The 2000 Planning Database does not yet exist. According to bureau documentation and interviews with cognizant staff, a prototype was used in the 1995 Census Test that included only census data for the test sites. 5. The Census Bureau believes that current technology can resolve any logistical issues that might arise in meeting the processing schedules if non-English questionnaire responses are translated at locations other than the data capture centers. OIG Response: Bureau staff plan to translate forms in any language other than English or Spanish through manual (non-automated) translation. Therefore, we do not agree that technology will address our concerns.  2   6.  To the greatest extent possible, the Census Bureau intends the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal to be a demonstration of the activities we will use to conduct Census 2000. We do not view it as a ""separate process"" from the planning for Census 2000. OIG Response: Again, we understand the stated intent. The reference to viewing the dress rehearsal separately from the census came from cognizant staff, with whom we held extensive discussions.  7.  The Census Bureau conceives of the Census 2000 partnership program as a broad series of collaborations with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as with community-based organizations, businesses, the media, and others. The distribution of Be Counted questionnaires, including those in languages other than English, and the targeted mailing of non-English questionnaires to households in areas with high concentrations of linguisticallyisolated households, are only limited elements of the partnership program. OIG Response: We agree that there are additional elements to the partnership program.  8.  The Census Bureau believes that it would not be difficult to refuse a request to expand the Be Counted program when it is not justifiable on a cost, schedule, and performance basis. Should the Census Bureau turn down such a request, we anticipate that our partners would expand their local outreach programs in areas with low response. OIG Response: See number 1.  9.  The Census Bureau agrees with your conclusion that the partnership and coverage improvement programs cannot replace statistical methods in containing costs and reducing the differential undercount on a large-scale basis. However, we believe that such programs can have a positive effect in a particular neighborhood or locality when we work in collaboration with local or tribal governments and other partner organizations. OIG Response: Given time and budget constraints, the relevant question is one of cost-benefit tradeoffs among programs competing for those limited resources.  3"
GX005-01-10518897	"TELEMEDICINE REPORT TO CONGRESS   January 31, 1997           EVALUATION    A. OVERVIEW    The advance of telemedicine technology has created a host of relevant new clinical and educational applications. From video conferencing to store-and-forward capability, health care professionals are finding many uses for this technology. The next challenge lies in answering critical technical, clinical, and organizational questions about what works and what does not.     The need for more evaluation of this technology has been a pressing concern for the Joint Working Group on Telemedicine. A recent report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and a soon-to-be released General Accounting Office (GAO) report have stressed the importance of the JWGT as a structure for coordinating Federal programs and, more specifically, creating a process of sharing evaluative information across agencies.     This chapter will provide an overview of collaborative and individual efforts of the JWGT-participating agencies. These activities include the Federal Telemedicine Gateway, the Joint Evaluation Framework, the Institute of Medicine report, and the Office of Rural Health Policy/Abt survey of rural telemedicine. The chapter will also outline what is known about the use of telemedicine and provide a list of lessons learned from the various Federal projects and initiatives.         B. THE FEDERAL TELEMEDICINE GATEWAY AND INVENTORY OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY PROJECTS    Despite the growing interest in telemedicine, and the need for ""hard data,"" little is currently known about the extent of telemedicine in the United States. To address this need for more information, the JWGT is examining the use of World Wide Web technologies to create an inventory of Federal telemedicine activities. The intent of this initiative is to simplify the collection of and timely access to data on Federal telemedicine activities. The development of software and procedures to ease maintenance of data and ensure security and privacy is currently underway. These developments will enable individual agencies to maintain and update their own project information in a quick and cost-effective manner.     Using a Department of Defense contractor and technical assistance from the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Veterans Affairs (VA), Agriculture (USDA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the JWGT created an inventory and data base that eventually will be available to the public on a web site. The Federal Telemedicine Gateway web site includes an inventory of federally-funded projects as well as linkages to other web sites that contain information on telemedicine activities in the private sector and states.     The inventory includes information from demonstration grant projects from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Department of Agriculture. It also includes direct provision of health care services through the Indian Health Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Justice.     At the most fundamental level, the inventory contains a data base that includes basic descriptive information on each Federal project, including names of individuals to be contacted for further information. Wherever possible, available information is organized in a uniform format, allowing analyses across projects. The data base is incorporated into a geographic information system that facilitates linkage of information in the inventory to other basic data about communities in which telemedicine projects are implemented. Basic analytic reports are to be developed from the information maintained in the inventory.         C. SUMMARY OF THE GATEWAY AND INVENTORY    The inventory and Gateway can and should be viewed as a prototype. In particular, once developed, additional data, such as those on distance learning or public health applications of telecommunications, can be added to the inventory. Several states have expressed interest in being linked to the inventory once it is developed. Moreover, the basic design of the inventory could be very useful to other initiatives that need to be tracked by the Federal government, e.g., Medicaid or welfare reform demonstrations.     Currently, the inventory is undergoing technical evaluation. Initial evaluation has revealed some of the limitations of the web technology available today. It also has shown the weaknesses in the information reported and maintained by Federal agencies, highlighting the need for greater attention to routine data collection on federally-funded programs. Release of the complete inventory is anticipated by the end of February 1997, assuming that all technical problems can be addressed by the contractor by mid-January.     Access to the Gateway is currently available through the World Wide Web (WWW), with levels of access assigned according to organizational affiliation and project participation. Access to the database is available at http://www.tmgateway.org.         D. THE FEDERAL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK    The absence of evaluative information continues to be a hurdle to a wider use of telemedicine. Policy makers at both the Federal and state levels may find it hard to answer critical questions regarding cost, infrastructure, quality, and effectiveness without more sound and thorough information about the use of telemedicine to improve health care delivery. However, there are efforts underway to address these concerns. To facilitate coordination among Federal agencies and with the states and private sector, the JWGT has developed a framework (1)  for evaluating telemedicine projects. The framework (outlined in Box 2 ) represents a blueprint for sharing information across federally-funded projects and studies. It provides examples of the questions that need to be asked dfor six major areas or domains of concern. These questions are generic and  could apply equally to Federal and non-Federal projects and studies.If successful, the framework also should facilitate cooperative evaluation efforts with private-sector telemedicine projects. (2)          E. OTHER EVALUATION ACTIVITIES BY JWGT AGENCIES    ORHP has funded a cooperative agreement with the Telemedicine Research Center to develop uniform data collection instruments and collect uniform evaluation data in the 20 networks funded by ORHP. HCFA is funding an evaluation of health systems utilization and cost-effectiveness with telemedicine. The two agencies also are pursuing development of common evaluation instruments. If successful, these instruments would allow for comparison of information across the two agencies, thus increasing the amount of data available and strengthening each agency's ongoing evaluation efforts.     At the Departement of Commerce, NTIA's Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program requires each of its grantees to conduct evaluations of their telemedicine projects. In addition, NTIA recently released  Lessons Learned from the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program,  a report based on the experiences of its grantees with a variety of information infrastructure projects in health, education, and other social services.     The Department of Defense has embarked on a comprehensive evaluation of telemedicine within some of its demonstration projects and the use of telemedicine in support of deployed troops (e.g., in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia). The DoD evaluations include the development of outcomes measures to assess the clinical efficacy of telemedicine. The NLM has funded contracts to evaluate the information content necessary to make good clinical decisions using various telemedicine technologies. The Agency for Health Care, Policy & Research (AHCPR) has awarded one grant and may award additional grants to examine the cost and medical effectiveness of telemedicine. The results of these studies, and others, will help answer critical questions about what works and what does not in telemedicine.         F. THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORT ON TELEMEDICINE EVALUATION    The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, funded by the NLM and other Federal agencies, provides one of the more comprehensive assessments of telemedicine evaluation to date. This report provides further refinement of the JWGT framework and outlines many of the next steps to be taken in evaluation as shown in Box 3. The IOM's committee evaluation framework includes four components: principles, planning processes, evaluation elements, and evaluation questions. These principles call for the evaluation to be:           Incorporated from the start of project planning;     Viewed as a cumulative process of building knowledge, not as an isolated effort;     Organized around comparisons with the benefits and costs of relevant health care alternatives;     Aimed at identifying practical, affordable, and sustainable applications            G. THE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH POLICY/ABT SURVEY OF RURAL TELEMEDICINE    In January, 1997, ORHP released the first major national survey of rural telemedicine. ""The Exploratory Evaluation of Rural Applications of Telemedicine"", conducted by Abt Associates, Inc., which includes information about  the extent to which telemedicine is used in rural areas, by whom, for what purposes, and the costs.         Key Findings    By the beginning of 1997, nearly 30% of the 159 rural hospitals surveyed in the winter of 1996 are expected to be using some sort of telemedicine technology to deliver patient care. Of these, 68% are expected to offer only teleradiology.                         More than 40% of the telemedicine programs surveyed had been providing teleconsults for one year or less.     Radiology and cardiology were the most common clinical applications reported, followed by orthopedics, dermatology and psychiatry.      Telemedicine systems were also used for non-clinical applications such as continuing education for health professionals. Fifty-eight percent of the sample had used their equipment for four or more different non-clinical uses.      Despite growth and expansion, the cost of telemedicine remained high. The average equipment purchase, excluding switches and new lines ranged from $134,378 for ""spoke"" sites to $287,503 for ""hub"" sites. (3)  Reported annual transmission costs were also high, ranging from an average of $18,573 for spokes to $80,068 for hubs. Slightly less than 20 percent spent less than $50 per session in transmission costs, while seven percent spent at least $500 per session. High costs, combined with low utilization  in the early years of operation, yielded high unit costs. A teleconsult cost the median or typical hub site $1,181, while the median spoke site spent $476 per consult, exclusive of any reimbursement to clinicians.           Federal and state grants were common sources of direct funding for telemedicine programs, and the majority of sites also received hospital financial support. Third-party reimbursement for telemedicine was elusive; fewer than 25% of hub facilities had successfully negotiated payment with insurance carriers and many had not yet undertaken such negotiations.     The most common transmission technologies involved copper telephone lines (78 percent of Telemedicine facilities and 83 percent of Teleradiology Only facilities), and dedicated telecommunication services such as T1 (76 and 29 percent of Telemedicine and Teleradiology Only facilities respectively). Fiber optic lines were also commonly reported (52 percent of Telemedicine facilities) as were switched services such as switched 56 Kbps and ISDN. Satellite or microwave  transmission were each mentioned by less than 10 percent of respondents. Thirty eight percent of responding sites reported availability of not only a dedicated service, but also a switched service.         The majority of telemedicine facilities reported the use of real time technologies for the transmission of data and images (90 percent). Two-thirds had store-and-forward technologies available, and most had both.     Utilization was low in the first years of most rural telemedicine programs. Only 17 percent used their system more than once each day.     Sixty percent of facilities that had been operating between one and two years had a narrow range of clinical applications whereas those operating for two or more years were more likely to have a broader set of applications (62 percent).     H. LESSONS LEARNED    In addition to the information provided by the IOM and ORHP/Abt studies concerning telemedicine trends, there have been important lessons learned on a project by project basis from the experience of federally-funded telemedicine projects.     The majority of federally-funded telemedicine projects are currently in the early stages of development. Most have been in existence for only three years or less. Thus, similar to any startup company, these projects have faced steep learning curves. Despite this relatively short history, project developers have gleaned some early lessons from the pre-planning, startup, and sustainable phases of the telemedicine projects' development.         Pre-planning Phase    Pre-planning is probably the most important phase in the development of a telemedicine system. In this phase, the telemedicine planners must identify their client's needs, the scope of their market, the type of technology that fits the market, and the type of infrastructure that will meet their needs.     Develop a business plan.  Among Federal grantees, those organizations that developed a solid business plan were more successful than those that did not. In the business plan, it is important to anticipate and plan for sustainable service once subsidies are gone. In addition, a business plan should include:     A thorough needs assessment.   Find out about the community's clinical and educational needs. Canvass users from the beginning. User input is critical to the success of the project, helping to avoid mismatches between equipment and needs. Early user input is critical not only in determining the type of technology used but also in the design of the system.         Technology matched to clinical needs . Clinical needs, not technology, should drive the development of a telemedicine system. Successful projects used a thorough technology assessment to select the most simple and least expensive equipment to meet their clinical requirements.     A clear understanding of the existing telecom delivery system .  The goals and objectives within that delivery system need to be understood and incorporated into the system and organizational design. System designers must begin with a careful analysis of the present telecommunications infrastructure and build upon it. They must consider modes of transmission, such as copper, fiber optics, satellite, and cable. Types of technology such as PC-based vs. dedicated teleconference systems stems must be evaluated in terms of the benefits vs. cost.     Flexibility.  The rapidly changing nature of telemedicine technology puts a premium on creating flexible systems that can adapt to new equipment. Designers of telemedicine delivery must constantly strive to develop systems that are readily adaptable to improvements in technology as well as reductions in cost. To the extent possible they should incorporate off-the-shelf equipment that does not require a great deal of customizing. Customizing can be expensive and may demand greater technical expertise in geographic areas where such expertise is not readily available.     Simplicity--""Keep it simple"".   This is a principle familiar to those serving in the armed services (See Box 5). The choices in telecommunications and computer based technology, coupled with the variety of medical applications possible, creates an overwhelming array of options when developing telemedicine systems.   Experience leads us to believe that the most successful systems are those that use the simplest and least expensive technology to meet a need.     Human factors.  The design of any telemedicine system must be viewed as useful to the practitioners. Physicians and other health care professionals have difficulty adapting to technology that does not meet their needs. The technology must fit within the scope of practice.     Negotiating telecommunication costs.  Successful projects quickly learned to negotiate and work with telecommunications vendors and telephone companies to keep transmission costs low. This was particularly important in rural areas, where the telecommunications infrastructure and resulting rate structure vary greatly. In some areas, telephone lines may have to be installed or connected before they will support telemedicine.     Get a price for transmission costs as early as possible, negotiate lower rates, or consider using a lower bandwidth telemedicine system if it provides adequate resolution and transmission speed. Be as creative as possible in structuring line connections to cross as few Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) (4)  boundaries in order to keep transmission costs down. Work with the State Public Utility Commission to get the lowest possible rates.         Startup Phase    Identify and support a champion.  Effective leadership is the cornerstone of any telemedicine system (See Box 6). Those projects that supported a champion were more likely to be successful than those that did not. It was also important to target leaders from within the community's power structure who were able to dictate action and commit resources--both financial and human. Minimally, there should be clinical leadership because it is practitioners who drive telemedicine use.     Communicate a common vision . As in any successful business, a common vision of goals, priorities and needs must be communicated to all levels of the team--from the leaders to the practitioners to the technical support.     Start evaluation right away.  It is important to collect data right away. This will be valuable in your negotiations with insurers for reimbursement. They will base any decision on data relating to quality, access, and costs.       Foster multiple uses.  Successful networks do more than just clinical consultations. In the early stages, the clinical consult figures tend to be very low. Without multiple uses, it is hard for a network to become self-sustaining, quickly. Making the network available to other groups for administrative meetings, continuing education, degree programs, grand rounds, and community meetings can help lead to long-term viability. (See Box 7 )         Sustainable Phase.    Maintain training and on-going technical assistance.  Securing a good source of technical assistance is important from the ""get go"" of the project. Often, the only readily available source of technical advice may be vendors. Thus, network participants must develop a critical mass of technical expertise at both the receiving and sending sites. This responsibility cannot be vested in one individual per location, but rather enough to cover all the hours that the network is utilized. Training on this equipment should also be extended to the health professions so that providers will  be familiar and comfortable with this technology as they move from training to practice.     Standards and protocols should work together:  In order for the various telemedicine equipment and software to work together, standards and protocols must be established and must work together. Standards have been critical to the success of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center's tuberculosis project (see Box 9).  Information exchange, privacy and security were all dependent upon the existence of consistent standards among the participants. For example, the three organizations had to map data elements from one organization to the other. By choosing the Health Level 7 standard as the data messaging standard and TCP/IP as the data transmission standard, this process was helped greatly. Moreover the Center found that ""without some kind of agreement or standard policy, privacy and security levels may differ greatly and preclude necessary information and data exchange."" (5)  The center also attributed its success to the fact that this project was designed from the bottom up. Thus, the people facing a particular problem came up with solutions to the problem and were committed to the success of the project. The champions were close to the problem and they created a solution that was tightly focused.         I. NEXT STEPS    Detailed studies, separate from the demonstrations, are underway to begin to collect better clinical and cost data from the various agency demonstrations. Results from these studies, however, will take time. Current projects are just beginning to emerge from the proof of concept stage and it will take time to gather a critical volume of experience and data to answer many of the questions posed regarding telemedicine. For this reason, the agencies have been interested in developing common data collection tools that will permit aggregation of data across projects, whenever possible. Some of the next steps for evaluation include:     Uniform Evaluation Tool Development . As noted above, ORHP has awarded a grant to the Telemedicine Research Center to develop and evaluate instruments for creating a common data set for application across all agencies. Emphasis will be on collecting common data elements on clinical encounters, costs, and the structure of telemedicine provider organizations, whenever possible. The instruments will be first used in ORHP's 20 demonstration projects. The ORHP efforts will be closely coordinated with those of NLM and HCFA, the latter has awarded a major contract for an evaluation of telemedicine specifically focused on information required to develop payment policies. (See the discussion on HCFA payment demonstration.)     NTIA and the Rural Utilities Service are also coordinating their evaluation efforts with other agencies through the JWGT. It is hoped that this effort will result in data collection tools that would allow for analyses of data across projects.     Evaluation of Medicaid Telemedicine Programs . Currently, 10 states offer some telemedicine coverage under their Medicaid programs, but there is no general evaluation effort or opportunity for them to share their experiences, successes, and failures. The JWGT will assess the current level of evaluation activity in the Medicaid program and work with selected states to promote better evaluation. In particular, the JWGT will work with HCFA and ORHP to develop strategies for using state offices of rural health and HCFA regional offices to develop an ongoing mechanism to track Medicaid activities.     Evaluation of Telemedicine in Managed Care Settings .  Evaluation studies of telemedicine need to be expanded to managed care settings, and in particular, to rural managed care settings. Currently, there is very little penetration of managed care in rural settings, but several managed care plans, most notably in Minnesota and California, believe that telemedicine might provide a more cost-effective way for the plans to reach rural communities with needed services. Questions remain as to whether telemedicine technologies will be beneficial to rural communities in the long run through the provision of specialty care that would otherwise not be available, or will they result in reduced access and availability of care because specialists are no longer visiting these communities to provide care? HCFA is discussing the use of telemedicine with several large Medicare risk-based managed care plans. ORHP has had a number of inquiries from managed care plans that would like to be able to apply for ORHP grants this year to evaluate telemedicine programs.     Quality and Efficacy of Care . Very little current research is systematically evaluating quality and efficacy of telemedicine services. This is a very complicated area of research that needs to be pursued over the next two years, if this nation is to be a credible leader in telemedicine. DoD and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) are working together to develop strategies for assessing the clinical efficacy of telemedicine for specific specialty applications. This work may serve as a foundation for other agencies to build upon. State-funded initiatives are also beginning to establish research and demonstration efforts to assess the clinical efficacy of telemedicine services provided in different specialties. The JWGT plans to actively broker partnerships between these state and Federal efforts.     Evaluation of Telemedicine in Post-Acute Care (Home and Long-Term Care) and in Non-Health Care Settings.  Based on phone inquiries from the health care industry, this is clearly a priority area. One study in Ohio suggests that over 30 percent of emergency hospital readmissions of Medicaid patients from nursing homes might be prevented by timely teleconsulting triage with the patient's primary care practitioners. The JWGT will work with agencies currently funding projects in post-acute and non-health care settings to develop standard evaluation tools.          FOOTNOTES    1. Puskin, D. Brink, L. Mintzer, C.

Rapid changes in technology require that a well-managed library have a systematic plan for upgrading and replacing computers to ensure that it offers access to the most basic services.   The State Library acknowledges that no publicly funded agency or private, non-profit education institution can guarantee that resources/funds are available at all times. Having an equipment replacement policy in place can assist in allocating available resources and in making the best use of existing resources.   The following key components should be considered when developing an effective equipment replacement policy (examples of these elements are italicized).          General statement of need for policy.   Brevard College provides many and various information technology resources for use by the Brevard College community to support its educational mission. The use of these resources must be consistent with the goals of the college. All members of the Brevard College community are expected to act responsibly and to follow the college's guidelines, policies, and procedures in utilizing information technology and electronic networks accessed by such technology. All rights granted are also governed by the regulations of Brevard College and local, state, and federal laws.   Due to advances over the past decade, it has become apparent that change in the area of Information Systems (IS) is perhaps the only constant. While it would be desirable to purchase a computer or build a network that would need no further modification, unfortunately the reality of the situation dictates that a truly effective IS will always need to be dynamic. The purpose of this policy is to set forth those guidelines.   This policy applies to all computer and telecommunications systems and refers to all hardware, data, software and associated communications networks. In particular, this policy covers computers ranging from multi-user timesharing systems to single user personal computers, whether freestanding or connected to the network.   Brevard College  Computer Upgrade & Replacement Policy       Replacement cycle.   Rapid changes in technology require continuous upgrade and replacement of computer equipment to guarantee access to information resources. A replacement cycle of three to five years is strongly recommended.   Technology has become an essential means of conducting library business. Computer equipment is basic to the effective execution of duties of library staff in all areas of library service and to the public for accessing current information or materials not owned locally in print format. Acknowledging the rapid pace of changes in technology, the Rockingham County Public Library plans for the replacement of computer equipment on a schedule in keeping with the best practices of industry, currently every three to five years.  In cases of insufficient funding to address all of the identified needs, priorities will be established based on (1) number of computers available on site, (2) usage, (3) critical nature of work. Supplemental funds will be sought as necessary to address gaps in need.   Rockingham County Public Library  Computer Equipment Replacement Policy       Computers in the library will be upgraded at a minimum of every five years. Computers will be upgraded before that time if necessary to accommodate software releases/upgrades to the library automation system, or to enable access to new and/or improved electronic resources.   Davidson County Community College  Policy for Library Computer Upgrades       Designation of categories/levels of computer usage.   The level of capacity of a particular computer should reflect the tasks it is required to do. A computer that is used for multimedia applications will require greater capacity than one that is used solely for word-processing.    With the growing number of library resources being made available in electronic formats there is a need to plan for the inevitable upgrade or replacement of computer equipment. The diverse system requirements of technological resources in a library environment allow for a gradual shifting of equipment from one function to another, using more powerful computers in higher technological environments and older computers in more limited environments. In this manner the lifespan of a computer can be increased through intelligent use of its available resources. Each computer in the library will be evaluated on a yearly basis with regard to its ability to process the information resources being made available through it. New computers will be configured as integrated research stations, including access to every information resource (Internet, CD-ROM, Online Catalog) in the library. As new computers are purchased, the older computers will be moved to more limited use areas or applications. There are four general levels of use.    a) Integrated Research Station - Access to every information resource   b) Online Catalog Terminal - Limited Internet access to other information resources   c) CD-ROM network station - No Internet or online catalog applications   d) Single use applications - Print server for a computer group, additional circulation terminal, etc.   Pfeiffer University Library  Equipment Replacement/Update Policy   All computers within the SCPL inventory and in general use by staff or public will have one of the following designations applied: Comprehensive, Basic, or Limited   ""Comprehensive"" indicates a high-end, network ready computer, capable of performing an extensive variety of applications - including multimedia and Internet access - within a graphical operating environment.    ""Basic"" indicates a mid-range, network ready computer, capable of performing a variety of select applications - including adequate multimedia and/or Internet access performance - within a graphical operating environment.    ""Limited"" indicates a low-end computer adequate for performing a few select applications - ideally but not necessarily within a graphic operating environment.   Stanly County Public Library  Equipment Replacement Policy   Plan for redeployment of computers.   To extend the life span of computing resources, it may be desirable to implement a plan so that as computers are purchased, older machines are shifted to tasks that require less computing capacity.    As existing Comprehensive machines are replaced, their designation will be appropriately downgraded and they will then be reallocated to less intensive use within the library. Said reallocation(s) should have the effect of removing the lowest-end machine from general staff and public use.   Stanly County Public Library  Equipment Replacement Policy       Recognizing that different tasks require different computing resources, BCPLS will use the follow categories to distinguish computing needs:   1. Special Use   Items in this category would include specialized equipment such as large screen multimedia computers, Internet servers, automation servers, laptops, or other unique configurations. The replacement cycle for these items will be evaluated case-by-case with no standard replacement period. Upgrades (i.e. memory, disk space, etc.) may be more appropriate than replacement.   2. Current Technology   This category would include most public and some staff workstations (i.e. PAC, Internet, applications, CD-ROM, Multimedia). Specifications for these machines should be evaluated yearly at a minimum and preferably every six months. BCPLS will use the minimum standards for computing equipment established by the State Library of North Carolina as a guideline in determining specifications for this category of computer. The replacement cycle for these items will be set at three years. Initial emphasis will be on processor speed. Upgrades to memory and disk space will be considered to improve performance.    3. Standard Office   This category will include most staff workstations and some customer workstations. Workstations in this category will generally be configured to run office software such as word processing and spreadsheets. Upgrades will not be done unless special circumstances warrant. Generally, new machines will not be purchased for this category. Just replaced Current Technology units will be made available as Standard Office replacements or additions.   4. Minimum Automation   This category will include those staff workstations used primarily for automation and those machines which are dedicated to supplementing or offloading a server function (i.e. running TAP or loading MARC records). Workstations will be configured primarily to run automation software. Office functions such as word processing and spreadsheets will not be emphasized. Upgrades will not be performed on these units, however replacement components (i.e. floppy drives) will be considered. New units will not be purchased for this category unless warranted by special circumstances. Just replaced Standard Office or Current Technology units will be made available as Minimum Automation replacements or additions. Cast off units from this category will be disposed of as surplus equipment in accordance with BCPLS policy.   Burke County Public Library System  Computer Equipment Replacement/Upgrade Policy       Established cycle for review of policy.   The policy should be reviewed at regular intervals and should include the date adopted/modified.       Standard specifications for equipment purchases.        Purchasing computers from a single manufacturer may significantly reduce ongoing support and maintenance costs. This may also result in savings from volume discount on purchases.

GX008-83-11372535	"Statement of   Jennifer L. Dorn   Administrator   Federal Transit Administration   United States Department of Transportation   Before the   Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Related Agencies   Of the   Appropriations Committee   U.S. House of Representatives   Hearing on Cost-Controls and Cost-Drivers of   Federal Transit Administration Projects   April 1, 2003           Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the issues of costs and cost-drivers of Federal Transit Administration projects. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important issues, and to offer, as well, some perspectives on the President’s Fiscal Year 2004 budget proposal, as well.     As we enter the next reauthorization period, there are more active New Starts projects than ever before. This undoubtedly reflects the value that communities place on major transit investments to address mobility and congestion issues, and our budget proposal is responsive to this dynamic. At the same time, we fully recognize the need to ensure that Federal funds are spent on projects that are cost-effective and financially viable, and to ensure that, once projects are underway, they stay on-budget and on-schedule.     The Administration is seeking a legislative change beginning in FY 2004 that would limit the share of Section 5309 New Starts funds to not more than 50 percent of the total cost of a New Starts project. Strengthening this policy and the criteria to encourage New Starts sponsors to develop projects with the highest feasible local share will allow us to fund a greater number of meritorious projects in the future. In addition, it gives communities an even greater stake in ensuring that the return on investment in these projects is as high as possible.    FTA already considers the degree of local financial support for a project in making its annual budget recommendations on New Starts funding. FTA has, for a number of years, been encouraging project sponsors to lower their Federal share requests in order to be competitive with other projects in the New Starts pipeline. Congressional report language that instructs FTA to lower the maximum share to 60 percent on projects recommended for FFGAs awarded after September 2002 has also encouraged project sponsors to increase their share of these investments. Over the last 10 years, the New Starts share of projects with FFGAs has averaged approximately 50 percent.     As Deputy Secretary Jackson has testified, ""all forms of transportation must face the hard reality that Federal financial resources are not boundless and cannot fully fund every meritorious transportation need."" But the fact that New Starts have reflected, overall, a 50/50 Federal/State and local partnership is an important indication of the long-term viability of these transportation investments.    Our goal is to ensure that  every  project is cost-effective; that  every  project is delivered within budget; and that  every  project is delivered on-time. We believe that FTA’s project planning and oversight of major capital investments, including both New Starts and rail modernization projects, is among the best in government. Moreover, the vast majority of these complex transit infrastructure projects are within budget and on schedule, despite the fact that many are constructed in dense urban environments with significant engineering, rights-of-way, and utility relocation challenges. Nevertheless, we are committed to a rigorous program of continual improvement. To this end, we continue to re-examine FTA’s planning and oversight program.       Project Planning and Assessment.  The  2003 Annual Report on New Starts  reflects some important changes in the way we evaluate proposed New Starts projects, and will, of course, impact the planning and development of projects in the future. The ratings reflect a new measure of project benefits aimed at quantifying travel-time savings for all users of the proposed project (both existing riders and new riders). The ""Transportation System User Benefits"" measure captures a broader set of benefits to transit riders – including reductions in walk times, wait times, ride times, and number of transfers – in terms of savings in travel time. This measure replaces the number of new transit trips in the calculation of cost-effectiveness.     The new measure of user benefits was adopted as part of the December 7, 2000, Final Rule on Major Capital Investment Projects. It was developed in response to numerous comments from project sponsors and local decision makers for a measure that would more appropriately reflect the benefits of a proposed New Starts project. The new measure and the calculations required were discussed with transit agencies already in the New Starts development process, as well as those contemplating project development, at New Starts Roundtables and a variety of other forums. In order to make the transition as smooth as possible, FTA delayed the original implementation date for this measure from September 2001 until September 2002. FTA also developed software to generate the necessary data from each sponsor’s local forecasting model, and engaged a contractor to assist project sponsors in implementation.    You may have noted that several transit agencies had not yet submitted the required data when the report went to press. In most cases, this was because they had just entered the first project development phase that requires a rating, and time did not permit the necessary work to be completed. The ratings for these projects are listed as ""Not Yet Available."" A number of other agencies submitted information that raised questions about the validity of their ridership and travel-time savings projections. FTA has contacted and continues to work with these agencies to help them develop valid assumptions, information, and projections for their projects. Such projects have been listed as ""Not Rated"" for the cost-effectiveness and mobility improvements measures in this report. Revised ratings for those agencies that have not been rated or that did not submit data will be made available to Congress and other interested parties as these issues are resolved.     FTA also continues to encourage project sponsors to fund New Starts projects with the highest possible local share. Consistent with this Congressional direction provided in the Conference Report that accompanied the FY 2002 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, projects seeking a Federal New Starts share over 60 percent have been given a ""low"" rating for local financial commitment, which results in a ""Not Recommended"" rating overall. In addition, the Administration is seeking legislation that would limit the Federal New Starts share to no more than 50 percent beginning in FY 2004. The four new projects recommended for funding in the President’s FY 2004 budget have been advised that a maximum 50 percent Federal New Starts share may be required. All four projects currently anticipate requesting a Federal New Starts share that is 50 percent or less.    The changes implemented this year have been very important, but I believe we can and should do even more. Over the next year, FTA will be working with a variety of stakeholders to explore advances in economic modeling that may help us improve even further our ability to forecast, measure, and evaluate the full range of economic benefits of our transit projects.     In addition, we are working to make our New Starts evaluation and rating process even more transparent than it is at present. I believe the New Starts report clearly lays out the evaluation results for each project, but we do not want project sponsors to have to wait until the report comes out to know how they are rated. Our goal is to create a rating system that is so transparent that project sponsors can calculate their own rating. While some measures may entail some subjective assessments, we believe that there should be no mystery about the New Starts criteria, measures or rating process.    Finally, in order to maximize the return on Federal investments, FTA intends to focus even more on helping project sponsors identify cost-effective transportation alternatives early in the project development process. We are offering technical assistance to help sponsors make decisions about project design and scope based on cost-benefit analyses; develop accurate budgets and schedules, with appropriate contingencies; and adhere to those budgets and schedules.       Major Cost-Drivers.  We met recently with several of the chief engineers and construction managers who participate in FTA’s Transit Construction Roundtable. They agree that cost control is an important issue, and appreciate the fact that FTA is taking an interest in the challenges they face.     Among the major project-specific cost drivers they identified were:              The degree to which environmental impact mitigation is necessary;       The degree to which real estate must be acquired and/or combined; and       Lack of a clear local consensus on the project scope and alignment that can delay a       project, or lead to cost increases related to scope expansions or project enhancements       intended to satisfy disparate community interests.          Other factors identified that have driven up project costs more generally included:              The relatively low number of vendors for major transit system components such as buses,       railcars, fare machines and information systems;        The variable year-to-year demand for rail cars that increases manufacturing costs;        General increases in real estate prices; and       Increased bonding and insurance costs, particularly since September 11 th .          FTA plans to continue to work closely with project sponsors to analyze project costs, identify important cost factors in project design, and use this information to help communities design and build cost-effective transit projects.       Controlling Costs through Effective Project Oversight.  While we believe that effective planning is critical, controlling costs once a project is underway is equally important, and FTA has increasingly focused on improving project oversight to ensure that we meet this objective. In our view, improving oversight does not necessarily mean increasing the number of oversight reviews or creating new topic-specific reviews. It is far more important to enhance the value, accountability, and effectiveness of reviews. Over the last two years, FTA efforts to do so have included:            Special Reviews.  Due to the extraordinary size, complexity and financial     implications of the New York MTA East Side Access project, FTA engaged the Army Corps of     Engineers to perform an independent review of this mega-project in the fall of 2001. Their     review focused on the MTA’s costs estimates, schedule and contracting strategy. The     Corp’s expertise was valuable to us in this case, and resulted in substantive changes     to the project, including a more rigorous definition of project scope.               Project Management Oversight (PMO) Contractor Accountabilities.  We are taking the     opportunity presented by the re-competition of the 5-year PMO contracts to increase     contractor responsibility and accountability with respect to cost and schedule analysis.     In addition, we are increasing the role of contractors in addressing emerging project     management issues. We are also examining ways to measure contractor performance and     incorporate these measures into the management of the contracts.             Procedures for Cost Estimation and Project Scheduling.  FTA is currently updating and     expanding its guidance for project sponsors to provide a more structured and comprehensive     process for developing cost estimates and project schedules, including handling of     contingencies.             PMO Regulations and Guidance.  During the coming year, we will also be undertaking a     significant revision of FTA’s Project Management Oversight regulation, as well as a     revision of our internal guidance to the PMO contractors, to more fully reflect our more     rigorous oversight requirements, as well as our expectations with regard to providing     technical assistance to help prevent potential problems.             New Starts Project Teams.  FTA has established a team approach to overseeing New     Starts projects throughout the life of the project. A team of regional and headquarters     planning, engineering and legal staff is now formed to coordinate oversight of each     project from start to finish. We believe this approach will facilitate coordination and     resolution of issues, and improve the efficiency of our oversight activities.            New Starts Database and Management Information System : FTA has nearly completed the     development of a comprehensive management information system that will track New Starts     projects from the initial planning stages through construction and implementation. This     system will provide FTA a tool to track trends in costs and benefits, conduct     cross-cutting analysis, and more efficiently produce management information to enhance     oversight of New Starts projects.               Full Funding Grant Agreement Circular.  FTA has recently released a revised Full     Funding Grant Agreement Circular, which fully documents the process and requirements for     projects seeking and receiving an FFGA.             Before and After Studies of Project Effectiveness:  Starting in FY 2002, all projects     that receive Full Funding Grant Agreements are required to collect data and perform a     ""before and after study"" of the project that compares the original forecasts     with actual results. Each study will collect and analyze forecasted and actual information     on the project’s capital and operating costs, project scope, ridership, and     operations. From this information, FTA will assess the impact and effectiveness of New     Starts projects, as well as ways in which planning and project development forecasts can     be improved.       In addition, through regularly scheduled dialogues with our Project Management Oversight contractors, Financial Management Oversight contractors, Office of Inspector General auditors, FTA managers and engineers, and transit agency managers and engineers, we continue to offer opportunities to share information on a peer-to-peer basis, highlight important emerging issues, and identify additional ways to improve our technical assistance and oversight activities.    Fiscal Year 2004 New Starts Budget Proposal and Cost-Related Legislative Changes.  The President’s Fiscal Year 2004 budget proposes to increase the New Starts program by 21 percent ($263 million) over the recently enacted level for FY 2003. This growth is important for two reasons. First, it ensures that we will be able to meet the commitments made under existing full funding grant agreements and fund the most meritorious projects in the New Starts pipeline. Second, it is critical to achieving our goal of promoting common sense transit solutions. This increase will permit us to fund cost-effective non-fixed guideway transportation corridor solutions, as well as the fixed guideway projects authorized under current law. With today’s technology – particularly bus rapid transit – a fixed guideway is not always necessary to create a cost-effective major new or expanded corridor system. Currently, however, by making the inclusion of a fixed guideway a fundamental requirement for a New Starts grant, we encourage communities to consider only these more expensive alternatives. Further, some small and medium-sized communities that would benefit enormously from the creation of new transit options simply cannot generate enough new riders or travel-time savings to justify a more expensive fixed guideway system. We will work closely with Congress and with all of our stakeholders to ensure that, as we make room for these cost-effective non-fixed guideway transit solutions, we do not compromise the intent of the New Starts program.     In the context of this change, we are proposing two additional modifications to the New Starts program. As you know, under current law, any project requesting less than $25 million in New Starts funding is exempt from the rigorous New Starts evaluation and ratings process. Unfortunately, experience has demonstrated that early project estimates can be inaccurate. On numerous occasions, project sponsors who intend to seek funds without participating in the project evaluation process suffer serious set-backs when they determine that they do, in fact, require more than $25 million in funding from New Starts. Moreover, small projects that proceed without adequate attention to ridership and financial projections may find themselves in financial difficulty. In addition, elimination of this exemption will deter dividing corridor transportation systems into artificially small segments in order to avoid the New Starts evaluation process. Therefore, we propose to eliminate the $25 million exemption in the New Starts program. Under our proposal, any project that seeks Federal New Starts funds will be required to participate in the New Starts evaluation and rating process. At the same time, we recognize that the complexity of New Starts projects can vary considerably. Therefore we are proposing that projects requesting less than $75 million be subject to a simplified evaluation and ratings process. We would utilize the same evaluation criteria established by Congress for projects seeking more than $75 million in funding from New Starts, but develop a less complicated measurement and ratings system for these projects.     Mr. Chairman, we believe that, taken together, these changes will help communities select the most cost-effective, common sense transit solutions.       The President’s Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Proposal      Recognizing the fact that this Subcommittee will soon begin its work on the Fiscal Year 2004 budget, I appreciate the opportunity to offer additional information for the record about the President’s proposed budget for transit. The President’s budget is good news for all of us who care about public transportation. In the face of enormous and costly national challenges – fighting terrorism, protecting our homeland, and promoting economic growth – the FY 2004 budget signals the high priority that President Bush and Secretary Mineta place on our national transportation system. This proposed budget sustains the record $7.2 billion in   Federal investment in public transportation passed by Congress and supported by the President in FY 2003.     Public transportation offers a variety of benefits to communities and to the Nation. It contributes to a healthy economy, ensures community mobility, reduces congestion, helps conserve energy, and helps protect the environment. I believe that this budget proposal, particularly when combined with other reauthorization proposals, can position transit to achieve tremendous success in 2004 and beyond. Furthermore, as illustrated in the recently released Conditions and Performance Report, this budget, with equal participation from States and local communities, will keep America on track not only to maintain our transit infrastructure at its current ""good"" average rating, but to improve it as well.    Last year, I testified regarding the success of TEA-21 and the opportunities we envision to build upon that success. Foremost among these was providing stable, dependable funding streams for transit. Dependable formula funding and full funding grant agreements (FFGAs) have significantly improved the ability of transit agencies to finance, plan, and execute projects that produce real results for the transit-riding public.     As I indicated in my testimony last April, stable formula funds help agencies do more with limited resources because they give financial markets the confidence to support transit investments; give communities an incentive to commit long-term resources; and give community developers the confidence that the transit commitments necessary to support new development will be honored.     It should come as no surprise, therefore, that our budget reflects a significant shift away from the uncertainty of discretionary grant programs to more predictable formula-based and multi-year funding programs. In particular, when compared to the recently enacted FY 2003 budget, the President’s proposed FY 2004 budget would:        Increase by nearly 20 percent (up $55 million) formula-based transportation funding for     rural communities to help address transportation needs in the 40 percent of rural counties     that currently have no public transportation services;          Fund the transportation component of the President’s New Freedom Initiative ($145     million) as a formula program to States in order to provide increased transportation     services to better meet the needs of persons with disabilities;          Increase by 21 percent (up $263 million) transportation funding for an expanded New     Starts program so that current full funding grant agreements can be honored, meritorious     projects in the pipeline can be funded, and a broader spectrum of cost-effective     transportation projects can be accommodated; and          Increase by 22 percent (up $16 million) formula funding for State and metropolitan     planning, technical assistance and training in order to help States and communities take     full advantage of recent advances in transportation planning technology and help ensure     that our investments in transit are cost-effective.      Through these formula and multi-year merit-based programs, we will put Federal public transportation dollars to work equitably throughout the Nation. Today, only about half of our States and urban communities receive Bus and Bus-related discretionary funds by earmark each year.       Reauthorization Concepts Reflected in the FY 2004 Budget      Predictable funding is but one of the important goals of the programmatic changes proposed in the President’s FY 2004 budget. As we developed the budget proposal, we were mindful of the fact that it represents what will be the first year of the reauthorized surface transportation act. In anticipation of this, the 2004 budget request reflects the budgetary foundation for the new legislation that will authorize these programs for the next several years. While the final details of the reauthorization proposal for transit are still being cleared within the Administration, there are a number of concepts reflected in our budget that I am pleased to be able to share with the Subcommittee today.    First and foremost, we are proud that this budget proposal promotes common sense transit solutions. We know that this is what American taxpayers want and expect of public transportation, and we want to help every community deliver on this promise. To accomplish this goal, we propose to reduce the number of different program ""silos"" and formularize all programs except New Starts, so that States and localities have the flexibility they need to fund local priorities. Instead of trying to match projects to specific pots of money, we want States and localities to be able to base their transit decisions on maximizing mobility and creating seamless community transportation networks.     Second, consistent with the President’s call for customer-focused, outcome-oriented government, our budget proposal includes a new ridership-based performance incentive program to encourage A-plus performance in transit. The program will be relatively small the first year – $35 million in urbanized areas and approximately $3 million in rural areas. Nevertheless, it will encourage States and urban areas to institute the data collection necessary to measure performance, and focus attention on the issues that matter most to riders and potential riders.     Third, this budget reflects the President’s and FTA’s determination to keep our commitments, especially to the people who most depend on public transportation for basic mobility. By sustaining Federal funding at the TEA-21 record-high levels, we will be able to continue to provide stable, predictable formula funds to urbanized areas, increase funding for underserved rural communities, honor our multi-year funding commitments under the New Starts program, and, perhaps most importantly, improve services to the elderly, low income, and persons with disabilities through coordinated planning and predictable funding.    Finally, this budget supports the President’s efforts to champion independence and economic opportunity for all Americans. It proposes the creation of a new formula program as part of the President’s New Freedom Initiative, providing $145 million for new transportation services to help persons with disabilities have the opportunity to become more fully integrated into American communities. Further, our proposed 20 percent increase in funding for rural communities represents a ""down payment"" on our commitment to basic mobility for all Americans.       Sustaining the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund      Before I review the specifics of FTA’s budget proposal, I would like to briefly comment on the issue of split-funding transit programs from the Mass Transit Account and the General Fund. Historically, approximately 80 percent of the funding for transit programs has been provided from the Mass Transit Account, with the remaining 20 percent coming from the General Fund of the Treasury. This 80/20 funding split was carried through each FTA program.     Under current accounting practice, FTA’s split-funded accounts are drawn-down (or outlayed) immediately and placed in the General Fund. This results in the premature draw-down of the Mass Transit Account, and would, if left unaddressed, result in the depletion of the account by 2007.     The President’s FY 2004 budget proposal addresses this issue by funding as many programs as possible from a single source, while maintaining the overall approximate proportion (80/20 percent) of funding between the Mass Transit Account and the General Fund. In particular, we propose to fund formula programs and research activities entirely from the Mass Transit Account; to fund the FTA Administrative account entirely from the General Fund; and to split-fund only the New Starts program. By minimizing the number of split-funded accounts, we significantly reduce the premature draw-down of the Mass Transit Account, thus avoiding the depletion of that account.      Urbanized Area Formula Programs      Under the President’s budget proposal, urbanized areas will have increased flexibility and more predictable funding. By folding a portion of the former bus discretionary program into the formula program, we propose to ensure that every community can count on a share of these funds each year.     We propose to move the Fixed Guideway Modernization program from the Capital Investment Grant Account to the new Formula Grants and Research Account. In doing so, we do not propose to change either the funding level for this program or the formula used to distribute these funds. However, we will accomplish the important goal of increasing local flexibility and administrative ease in the use of these funds from year to year. As you may be aware, some communities find that their need for Fixed Guideway Modernization funds can vary substantially from year to year, and the priority they give to other investments also varies. We propose to give communities the flexibility to merge Fixed Guideway Modernization funds with their regular urbanized area formula grant, so that they can make more prudent, cost-effective investment decisions each year. In one year, for example, they may choose to invest more in buses; while the following year, they may require a larger expenditure on rail modernization projects. We believe that local decision-makers should have the flexibility to make long-term investment plans that are not driven by the old programmatic silos. Furthermore, by funding these programs from the same account, a grantee can submit a single application for bus or rail ongoing capital needs and preventive maintenance.    Finally, with regard to urbanized area programs, I would like to highlight our proposal to create a new Performance Incentive program that will reward those communities that focus on the customer and prove their success in increasing ridership. Participation in this program will be voluntary, and a portion of the FY 2004 funds will be available to establish data collection efforts and baseline measurements of ridership among the elderly, persons with disabilities, and low-income individuals. Our intent is to ensure that the ridership incentives do not adversely affect service to these important constituencies.      State-Administered Programs      This year, you will find a new line item in the FTA budget – State-administered programs. Like the urbanized area programs, we are proposing to allocate the non-urbanized area share of the bus program by formula instead of unpredictable discretionary grants. We believe the increased stability and predictability of funding that this change produces will make it easier for States to plan for public transportation investments and to leverage Federal dollars. The uncertainty of continued funding for a program has turned away many private funding partners and human service agencies who seek some level of certainty of funding from year to year.    In addition, we are proposing to allocate by formula to States all of the funds for transit programs that should be closely coordinated with human service programs in a State. Our proposal will continue the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program that is currently administered as a formula program to States, and it will create a similar formula allocation of funding for the President’s New Freedom Initiative. In addition, it will make the Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) program a state-level formula program. Currently, JARC is administered as a national competitive discretionary grant program, and, typically, many projects are earmarked in appropriations conference committee reports. The JARC program has proven its effectiveness, and should now be made more widely available.    These changes will help address the frustrating problems of coordination in many States. We believe it just makes common sense:              To give States predictable levels of funding for all three of these programs;       To give States the tools to leverage their human services transportation funds with       their public transportation funds; and       To let each State work with its urban and rural communities to establish funding       priorities. The key role of the State in selecting projects would remain as it is today,       but State decisions would be based on local community priorities.            Non-Urbanized (Rural) Formula Program.  Over the last year and a half, you’ve heard me say a number of times that I hoped to increase funding for rural public transportation. The FY 2004 budget makes good on that promise. This budget proposes a nearly 20 percent increase, or $55 million, in funding for the rural formula program. This is over and above the rural share of bus money and Rural Transportation Assistance Program funds that have historically gone to rural areas. It is a  real  increase in the funds available to rural areas in the formula program. It is needed, and it will be well-utilized, particularly if Congress accepts the important program changes reflected in the President’s FY 2004 budget.    In addition, as we have proposed in the urbanized area program, we are proposing the creation of a performance incentive program for rural areas. The program will be voluntary, but we believe that it will not only generate a new focus on transit customers and their needs, but also spur the development of a more rigorous transit database for rural areas.     And, finally, like the urbanized areas, States can now count on predictable levels of formula funding for rural areas from what used to be the bus discretionary program. We believe this will help every community by allowing them to make common sense decisions about longer-term transit investments, and not skew those decisions because of the uncertainty of funding.       Other State-Administered Programs.  Similarly, we have proposed programs for persons with disabilities and low income individuals that will provide predictable formula funds to be administered by States, as the Elderly and Disabled program is now. Specifically, we propose to provide $145 million for new transportation services to help persons with disabilities access opportunities and services in their communities – a critical component in achieving the President’s goal of fully integrating persons with disabilities into American life.     With this additional program, along with the formularization of the JARC program, we will not only keep our commitment to, but will improve services for the elderly, low-income individuals, and persons with disabilities. The absence of predictable funding has frustrated many States that want to leverage other transportation resources provided at the State level through such health and human service programs as Medicaid. In one Northeastern State, for example, the State Department of Transportation knew it had a solution to helping thousands of welfare recipients who could work, if they could just  get to  work. The state could make its program funds go twice as far if they could get a Job Access grant from FTA, matching it with State Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) funds for transportation services. But could they assure their State Human Services colleagues that the Job Access funds were really coming? In FY 2002, JARC projects were earmarked in law, and this particular State project was not among them. As a result, the State Department of Human Services obligated its funds to other services.    Even with predictable funding for these important services, we know that finding solutions that work is not always easy. So to help ensure that communities can make informed decisions about priorities and needs, we are also increasing the funds available for planning, administration and technical assistance. We want the coordinated health, human service and transportation planning that has been so successful in the Job Access program to become a common practice in every community. So we are also proposing that communities establish community-wide funding priorities and a coordinated plan for services to the elderly, persons with disabilities, and low-income populations. These plans will give each community more control over its transit planning – and make it easier to avoid the creation of costly, duplicate transportation systems. And, as long as the funds are used to serve the intended populations, we intend to ensure that the flexibility to leverage the funding for all of these programs exists. The bottom line is that we want to promote common sense solutions – solutions that will save money, and result in more and better service to more riders.       State and Metropolitan Planning      Good planning is critical to every transit program. That is why the President’s budget proposes a 22 percent ($16 million) increase in planning funds for State and Metropolitan Planning Programs in this budget. With 76 new urbanized areas designated as a result of the 2000 Census, additional funding will be needed to help support at least 50 new Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), as well as a number of existing MPOs whose geographic scope was significantly expanded. MPOs are responsible for preparing long-range and short-range plans for transportation improvements in their metropolitan area. This work involves ongoing public involvement, analysis of travel trends and forecasts, the assessment of community and environmental impacts, and financial planning to ensure that programs are financially feasible. Only projects that are formally adopted by the MPO are eligible for funding under FTA and Federal Highway Administration programs.     In addition to increased funding for basic planning activities, FTA is also creating, in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration, a new Planning Capacity Building Program to provide funds for improving State and local planning methods and technical capacity. Over the last several years, there have been a number of advances in transportation planning – new modeling techniques, technology-based forecasting, and a variety of new planning tools. We want to help all communities take advantage of these important advances.       FTA Administration      The President’s budget proposes $76.5 million for the administration of FTA’s $7 billion a year grant, technical assistance and oversight programs. With the proposed modest increase over FY 2003 levels, FTA will fund a number of mandatory increases, including Congressionally approved pay and benefit increases, as well as FTA’s portion of anticipated increases in building lease costs.     In addition, the President has requested an additional 10 full-time equivalents (FTEs) for FTA, based on a comprehensive workforce study completed in FY 2001. This study identified staffing shortages in five core occupational series, including engineers, community planners, transportation program specialists, information technology specialists, and financial specialist. The proposed increase will bring the total work-year level to 527, an increase of less than 2 percent over the FY 2003 President’s budget level of 517. In FY 2004, the 10 FTEs will be used to increase transit planning and engineering capacity, primarily in FTA regional offices, to help ensure that Federal investments in transit are appropriate and effective. Over the last 10 years, the increase in FTA staffing has not kept pace with the substantial increase in workload associated with program growth. Federal transit program funding has grown nearly six times faster than FTA staffing.     The proposed administrative budget also accommodates the necessary expenses to ensure that FTA accomplishes the key elements of President’s Management Agenda. FTA continues to make progress toward its responsibilities in these five government-wide initiatives, and a continuous effort is made to find ways to save and stretch taxpayer dollars. Some significant management advances within FTA over the past year include:            Strategic Management of Human Capital . FTA is piloting a new executive management     performance system under which every senior executive is jointly responsible for four core     accountabilities related to our mission. These are ridership, security readiness, project     planning and oversight, and grants management. Based on our experience with the pilot, we     will consider reforming the performance appraisal systems for all FTA employees. We are     also conducting a work force study to better align our resources along functional areas     and begin to address the workforce challenges posed by retirement and the skills needed to     achieve our mission.               Competitive Sourcing . We are moving forward on an ambitious competitive sourcing     initiative within FTA, focusing this year on our procurement and financial management     functions. This initiative will help us evaluate the cost of government services and     identify opportunities to improve business processes.               Expanded Electronic Government . FTA remains committed to aggressively using     information technology to reduce costs and better serve our customers. Our Transportation     Electronic Award and Management (TEAM) system is recognized within the DOT as a model     grants processing system. We continue to make improvements to TEAM that will move us     closer to 100 percent electronic processing of transit assistance applications.             Improved Financial Management . We have made significant improvements during the past     year in financial management and received a ""clean"" audit opinion from the     Department’s Inspector General for fiscal year 2002. Our improvements have included     converting to a new accounting system, reducing employee travel card delinquency rates,     and providing more timely reporting of financial information to Treasury and the Office of     Management and Budget.              Budget and Performance Integration . We continue to move toward a results-oriented     budget within FTA and will be using our core accountabilities to determine priorities for     making fiscal year 2003 funding decisions for our research and oversight programs. For     fiscal year 2004, our budget identifies specific performance goals related to ridership,     safety and security, and grants management.         Mr. Chairman, in summary, the President’s FY 2004 budget proposal lays the groundwork for a reauthorization plan that will build upon the success of ISTEA and TEA-21. The changes proposed by the President will help FTA better leverage the Federal investment in public transportation, meet the needs of those who count on transit for basic mobility, and give States and localities more predictable and flexible funds to more cost-effectively address their communities’ transportation needs. In addition, FTA continues to focus on the President’s Management Agenda to improve management practices, increase accountability, and enhance customer service. I would be pleased to answer any questions the Subcommittee may have."

Executive Summary This is the plan to coordinate domestic and foreign post-earthquake investigations supported by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). The plan addresses coordination of both the NEHRP agencies--Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), and U. S. Geological Survey (USGS)--and their partners. The plan is a framework for both coordinating what is going to be done and identifying responsibilities for post-earthquake investigations. It does not specify what will be done. Coordination is addressed in various time frames ranging from hours to years after an earthquake. The plan includes measures for (1) gaining rapid and general agreement on high-priority research opportunities, and (2) conducting the data gathering and field studies in a coordinated manner. It deals with identification, collection, processing, documentation, archiving, and dissemination of the results of post-earthquake work in a timely manner and easily accessible format. For the purposes of this plan a significant domestic earthquake is defined as either (1) an earthquake resulting in a Presidential disaster declaration, or (2) an earthquake considered by NEHRP agencies to provide an opportunity to learn how to reduce future earthquake losses in the United States. The plan organizes domestic post-earthquake investigation and information dissemination activities into three phases, which include the following elements: Phase I (immediate to several days)  Incident Report and Plan Implementation--Within a few minutes after a large or potentially damaging domestic earthquake, the USGS shall notify emergency managers, NEHRP agencies, state geological survey(s) in the affected state(s), and personnel designated by the NEHRP agencies. Following this incident report, the USGS shall convene with FEMA, NIST, NSF, the state geological survey(s), and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) to determine if the earthquake is significant and warrants implementation of either all or part of the NEHRP post-earthquake coordination plan. Immediately following this consultation, the USGS in cooperation with FEMA and the state geological surveys shall alert emergency management agencies about implementation of the plan.  Web Site Management--Within hours of the event, the USGS shall establish an event Web site with links to other earthquake-related Web sites. The USGS shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to earthscience information. EERI shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to engineering information as provided by engineering centers, institutions, and private practice.  Technical Clearinghouse--Within 24 hours following mutual consultation, the USGS, FEMA, and EERI will work with state agencies to organize a field technical clearinghouse. Depending on ability and capability, the affected state(s) may take the lead in organizing the clearinghouse. California already has formalized the process for establishing a clearinghouse, with the principal NEHRP-sponsored participants being FEMA (Region IX), EERI, and the USGS. State planning currently is being conducted for the central and western United States under the aegis of the Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC) and the Western States Seismic Policy Council (WSSPC). The clearinghouse is the focal point for coordinating activities and promoting the safety of all field parties during initial post-earthquake reconnaissance.  NEHRP Investigations Coordinator--Within 24 hours of a significant earthquake, the USGS in consultation with the other NEHRP agencies shall designate a NEHRP Investigations Coordinator. The Coordinator shall be kept abreast of all NEHRP activities and relevant communications with regards to the earthquake, ensure liaison with emergency managers is adequate, and assist the NEHRP agencies to optimize the deployment of NEHRP resources and to establish priorities for investigations.  NCST Investigation--Within 48 hours, NIST will examine the relevant factors associated with building failures that occur as a result of the earthquake and will make reasonable efforts to consult with the other NEHRP agencies prior to determining whether to conduct an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act. Any NIST investigation conducted under the authority of the Act will be limited to building failures on one or more buildings or on one or more class or type of buildings selected by NIST. Phase II (several days to 1 month)  Meeting--When the initial reconnaissance phase nears completion, the NEHRP Investigations Coordinator shall  1   convene a meeting to identify opportunities and needs for rapid concentrated data gathering and investigation, including systematic collection of perishable data. Within 24 hours of the meeting, the Coordinator shall prepare a report containing summary reconnaissance findings, recommendations for collection of perishable data, and an estimate of both the level of effort and amount of funding that will be required to conduct recommended activities. On the basis of this report and pending available funds, NEHRP agencies may invite, consider, and support proposals for rapid investigations. The Coordinator shall be kept informed of all NEHRP-supported investigations in order to facilitate coordination and minimize duplication of effort.  Budget Supplemental Decision--If the earthquake presents opportunities for investigations that would improve earthquake risk mitigation, but which cannot be supported with existing funds, the NEHRP agencies shall convene within a few days after the earthquake to consider a request for a budget supplemental. Phase III (1 month to 5 years)  Workshop on Investigation Priorities--Within 1 to 2 months of the earthquake, NSF and the USGS shall jointly sponsor a multidisciplinary workshop to evaluate both short- and long-term research and development opportunities, including what intensive follow-up investigations are warranted. The workshop will identify major opportunities and recommend priorities for funding.  Investigations Solicitation--Based on the outcomes of the Workshop on Investigation Priorities and within constraints of available funding, a joint statement may be issued by FEMA, NSF, USGS, and NIST that solicits proposals for long-term research and problem-focused studies. If possible, awards are to be made within 5 months of the event.  Information Dissemination--NEHRP shall support at a minimum three types of information dissemination activities following every significant domestic earthquake. (1) An event summary report for a broad audience shall be published within 3 months of the event. The report shall integrate preliminary observations on the response of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments. It shall be prepared by the USGS and EERI in collaboration with other NEHRP supported investigators and institutions. (2) On the first anniversary of the earthquake, FEMA, NIST, NSF, and the USGS, shall support local and state agencies involved in risk reduction to hold a public conference with an accompanying proceedings that summarizes the implications of the earthquake and identifies opportunities for earthquake risk reduction. The conference and proceedings shall be targeted at local and state decisionmakers and shall be held in the region impacted by the earthquake. Participation by Federal stakeholders shall be encouraged as well.  (3) A comprehensive synthesis of research and professional reports shall be published within 5 years of the event by the USGS and NIST. Data and other detailed information shall be archived in a NEHRP virtual data center and appropriately summarized in the synthesis report. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will contribute to the publications described above to the extent possible. For foreign earthquakes, which typically are less intensively investigated than domestic earthquakes, the plan recommends that all U.S. post-earthquake investigators inform EERI of plans and schedules of investigations before departure, as well as their ongoing status once in the field. EERI shall regularly report these planned activities and their status to the NEHRP agencies as well as on its Web site. NEHRP agencies shall monitor these plans to avoid interference by visiting U.S. investigators with local experts. This proposed plan concludes with recommendations that address several deficiencies in current domestic post-earthquake investigations. The deficiencies were identified at an invitational workshop of experienced post-earthquake investigators held as part of the process to prepare this plan. Areas in need of major improvement include:  Coverage and comprehensiveness of investigations of earthquake impacts, including performance of the built and socioeconomic environments.  Application of new information technology to data collection.  Data management and archiving. The plan recommends that NEHRP develop standard formats for the collection of data on the performance of buildings and other structures in regions of severe ground shaking, including damage to nonstructural components and information characterizing the earthquake resisting properties of structures. The standard formats for data collection shall consider those already developed for existing damage prediction tools, such as HAZUS, as well as current standardized procedures for seismic design, pre-event evaluation and rehabilitation, and post-event evaluation and repair of structures. All post-earthquake data, including that accumulated by both FEMA as part of the disaster assistance process and private structural engineering firms, should be both collected digitally and stored in a virtual Web-based archive. This new database could be maintained either by the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) or at various sites from where data would be retrievable from a single or mirrored Internet site using time stamps and a georeferencing system. The database would be addressable using all of the tools of a modern geographic information system as well as using modern relational database technology on the Internet. NEHRP also should involve a wider range of disciplines, including economics, sociology, and political science, in post-earthquake investigations. Protocols for data collection in these disciplines also should be standardized.  2   Because much of this information helps to reduce future losses, it is important that adequate funding be available for domestic post-earthquake investigations. For example, domestic post-earthquake investigations for each significant earthquake could be funded by establishing a separate fund during the next NEHRP reauthorization that could then be drawn upon for Federally-declared earthquake disasters; such funds could be administered by FEMA. Another possibility could be to designate and utilize existing agency programs to fund these activities. However, in the absence of such funds, all of the NEHRP agencies shall be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Such a template could also be used for post-event investigations of other types of disasters, including natural and terrorist events, which would allow for the documentation of information that would help improve the protection of the Nation's infrastructure from future events.   Documenting societal and economic impacts and providing information for improving earthquake response and recovery activities.  Identifying specific opportunities to mitigate the impacts of future earthquakes. In summary, benefits from post-earthquake investigations can include improved emergency response, a safer built environment, cost-effective construction of new structures and rehabilitation of older ones, improved land-use practices, and better understanding of earthquake hazards in the United States. This plan provides a framework for both coordinating what is going to be done and identifying responsibility for post-earthquake activities. It does not and cannot specify what will be done because each earthquake offers different challenges and learning opportunities. The plan applies primarily to the NEHRP Federal agencies and their partners, which range from state agencies, multi-state consortia, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI), the NSF-funded centers and organizations for earth science and earthquake engineering research and education, the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), to other academic and professional groups with professional interests in post-earthquake investigations. It is important to recognize that NEHRP post-earthquake activities primarily consist of information gathering and documentation of what happened. Some of this information, however, is of immediate interest to emergency managers and the public. NEHRP agencies and partners need to convey this information in a timely manner. The primary responsibility is to alert the public and Federal and state agencies about the occurrence and scope of the event. However, NEHRP investigators must be prepared to convey other aspects that bear on public safety or concerns. In addition to proposing a structure to improve coordination of the activities and investigations that typically are conducted following significant earthquakes, the plan also identifies new activities--some of which are permitted by advances in technology--that are considered significant to improve loss reduction in future earthquakes. These activities and a mechanism for their funding are described in four recommendations. Their implementation would substantially improve the contribution of NEHRP post-earthquake investigations to earthquake risk reduction in the United States. Earthquakes are one of several hazards that can cause large disasters that result in great loss of life and property. The most significant of these are hurricanes, floods, winter storms, tornadoes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and terrorism. Indeed, from 1992 to 1996, losses in the U.S. from natural hazards averaged about $1 billion per week (OSTP, 1997). Post-event documentation of these hazards and their consequences contributes significantly to improvements in mitigating their impact and thereby reduces future losses. Although scientific and technical aspects of these hazards may differ, post-disaster investigations pose many similar challenges. Thus, this plan for post-earthquake coordination should be useful for planning and coordinating investigations of these other hazards.  2. Purpose This report presents the plan to coordinate domestic and foreign post-earthquake investigations supported by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). As has been demonstrated in numerous disasters, authoritative and timely scientific and engineering advice after a disaster both improves emergency response and helps allay public fears and anxiety. Large urban earthquakes in the United States can cause many fatalities and great property loss. It is likely after a great earthquake that the Nation will turn to officials of NEHRP for authoritative advice following these inevitable events. By coordinating its post-earthquake response, NEHRP will be in a stronger position to provide input and work effectively with officials involved in the post-earthquake emergency response activities. Major earthquakes also provide critical information on earthquake processes, ground shaking, and the performance of the built and socioeconomic environments. A set of coordinated efforts during and following the event can enhance the information acquired. The nature and quality of this information can significantly reduce losses not only immediately following the specific event, but also from future events through improved planning, design, and construction. The infrequency of large damaging earthquakes and the many NEHRP-supported investigators who can be expected to conduct field studies after earthquakes require that post-event investigations be closely coordinated in order to maximize the learning that will improve mitigation of the effects of future earthquakes. Postearthquake investigations are critical for:  Providing insight into why and how faults rupture.  Understanding and predicting shaking and secondary ground deformation.  Documenting and improving performance of the built environment.  Evaluating the adequacy of current building standards and practices.  3   3. Background The 2001-2005 NEHRP Strategic Plan (FEMA, in press) stresses the importance of post-earthquake investigations. NEHRP has long supported post-earthquake investigations including efforts in the earth sciences, engineering, and socioeconomic disciplines. Improved coordination is necessary if these investigations are to maximize learning through the sharing of information. Because the USGS has the statutory responsibility and authority under Public Law 101-614 to conduct post-earthquake investigations, the Strategic Plan tasks NEHRP under the leadership of the USGS to (1) examine the roles and responsibilities of the various groups involved in post-earthquake investigations and (2) develop a NEHRP protocol action plan as well as a funding mechanism for investigations following major domestic and foreign earthquakes. According to the Strategic Plan, the NEHRP protocol action plan should detail the degree of coordinated learning desired, how those findings will be obtained, and how findings can be most effectively disseminated to all stakeholders in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary NEHRP report. The objectives of the present plan are to improve coordination during post-earthquake investigation efforts, minimize duplication of efforts, identify activities that could be supported with additional resources (such as disaster funds from FEMA or supplemental appropriations), and maximize the opportunity to learn from both domestic and foreign earthquakes. To develop the NEHRP protocol action plan, the USGS requested the assistance of the Applied Technology Council (ATC) of Redwood City, California, under USGS cooperative agreement 1434-WR-97-AG-00015, ATC-35. ATC organized a multidisciplinary 7-member committee to draft the plan and a multi-institutional oversight committee to review the plan. Input was solicited from experienced post-earthquake investigators and NEHRP agencies at an invitational workshop held March 13-14, 2001, in Menlo Park, California. The workshop was jointly sponsored with EERI. Based on input from the workshop, a draft plan was prepared. In addition to the review by the oversight committee, comments were solicited from the general post-earthquake investigation community on a draft posted on the ATC Web site. The present plan is the result of this manifold input and comment process.  occurring in the United States and abroad are treated separately. Domestic earthquakes provide NEHRP with its best opportunity to evaluate seismic hazards and the performance of the built and socioeconomic environments in the United States. Furthermore, NEHRP is directed to conduct investigations of domestic events by the 1977 Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act. Consequently, domestic earthquakes typically receive greater scrutiny by NEHRP than do foreign earthquakes. Foreign earthquakes, however, usually provide insight into crustal failure processes, seismic radiation fields, and some construction practices that contribute to earthquake risk mitigation in the United States, as well as opportunities for model validation. For example, about $1.5 million in NEHRP funds was used to support U.S. research investigations of the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, and Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquakes. In some cases, such as the 1988 Spitak, Armenia, and the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquakes, the affected countries request specific technical assistance from the U.S. Government, and these requests are usually fulfilled by NEHRP agencies. 4.1 Domestic Earthquakes The proposed plan to coordinate post-earthquake investigations for significant domestic earthquakes is shown schematically in figure 1. For the purpose of implementing the plan, either in part or in total, a significant domestic earthquake will be defined as follows: (1) an earthquake resulting in a Presidential disaster declaration or (2) an earthquake considered by NEHRP agencies to provide an opportunity to learn how to reduce future earthquake losses in the United States. The plan identifies the steps and approximate timeline necessary to achieve coordination goals, as well as the parties responsible for each activity. The responsible parties include NEHRP agencies, entities funded either in part or totally by NEHRP, and other entities with whom NEHRP should coordinate. As shown in the figure, these activities are parts of a continuum. Initial or Phase I post-earthquake activities focus on defining the scope of the disaster and are reconnaissance in nature. They quickly assess the character and distribution of inflicted damage and generated ground effects, identify research opportunities that will improve the practice of earthquake risk mitigation, set the stage for subsequent in-depth data gathering, and aid emergency managers by identifying hazardous situations that may be exacerbated by aftershocks or other processes. These Phase I activities are typically followed by more intensive data gathering for subsequent research and analysis. This period is commonly referred to as Phase II and may last for weeks after the event. Phase III is the longer period after the earthquake when comprehensive research and investigations are conducted. Most of the activities identified in the plan are currently conducted by NEHRP following domestic earthquakes. The plan is designed to place them into a more formal structure. Some of the activities, particularly those that apply new information technology, are evolving with each earthquake. For these activities, the plan tries to anticipate their evolution and assign responsibility for their implementation.  4. NEHRP Post-Earthquake Coordination Plan The plan addresses coordination during three time frames or phases after the earthquake:  Phase I--Post-earthquake reconnaissance during the first few days.  Phase II--Intensive gathering and archiving of perishable data during the first few weeks.  Phase III--Research and investigations, including additional data gathering and archiving, conducted during the subsequent months and years. The response of NEHRP to domestic and foreign earthquakes is sufficiently different in scope that earthquakes  4   Figure 1. Activities timeline for NEHRP Post-Earthquake Coordination Plan--Domestic earthquakes.  4.1.1 Phase I Following the USGS incident report and decision by the NEHRP agencies to activate the plan, several decisions must be made promptly by NEHRP. These decisions occur almost simultaneously. They include: (1) activation of an event web site, (2) establishment of a field technical clearinghouse, and (3) designation of an Investigations Coordinator.  4.1.1.1 Incident Report and Plan Implementation (USGS) When a large or potentially damaging earthquake occurs in the United States, the USGS shall determine and announce the magnitude and location of the earthquake within minutes. Once announced, emergency response personnel are alerted through the National Warning System (NAWAS), which is operated by FEMA. As development of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) progresses, the USGS capability to estimate the strength and geographic distribution of strong shaking will also improve. The USGS has the mandate to quickly provide information on the strength and distribution of strong ground shaking to emergency managers and others. The improved ANSS system is greatly improving the capability of USGS to fulfill this mandate. Each NEHRP agency shall identify (and review annually) a contact who shall be alerted directly by the USGS about the event. Each NEHRP agency also should develop a list and strategy for contacting entities that have partnership responsibilities in the area of post-earthquake investigation. Examples of such entities include EERI, state geological surveys and regional associations, earth science centers, and NSF-funded centers for earthquake engineering research and education.  These entities should request that the USGS provide automatic e-mail alerts, which can be received on cell phones, pagers, and computers. Following the incident report, the USGS shall convene a conference call with the NEHRP agencies, the state geological survey(s) in the affected state(s), and EERI to determine if the earthquake is significant. If the earthquake is deemed significant, the USGS in consultation with the preceding agencies and organizations shall decide whether to implement all or part of the NEHRP post-earthquake coordination plan. If the decision is made to implement the plan, the USGS in collaboration with the state geological surveys shall inform emergency management agencies of the implementation.  4.1.1.2 Web Site Management (USGS) Under the plan, the USGS shall be responsible for establishing, within a few hours of a significant earthquake, an event Web site with links to other Federal and non-Federal earthquake-related Web sites. The USGS has recently automated this process for any domestic earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 or greater and foreign earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or greater; smaller events may still be significant, however, and regional earthquake information centers will need to adopt and modify the automatic posting criteria to best meet the needs of their region. Beginning with the devastating earthquake in 1995 in Kobe, Japan, the Internet has become an important source of information about earthquake disasters for both technical personnel and the public. To facilitate searches for the event Web site, its URL and a link shall be posted on the USGS Earthquake Program Web site (http://earthquake.usgs.gov) and the EERI Web site (http:  5   //www.eeri.org). The event Web site shall include brief descriptions of linked sites so that earth scientists, engineers, and social scientists will be able to search efficiently for information about the earthquake. Entities that are funded by NEHRP agencies and that establish Web sites shall be instructed by their funding agencies to inform the USGS of their URL and provide the USGS with a brief description or abstract of the Web site. The USGS event Web site also shall include information about the location of and activities at the technical clearinghouse (see 4.1.1.3). The Web site shall include authoritative sources of information; the USGS, EERI, and FEMA have responsibility, respectively, for earth science, engineering, and Federal disaster information and assistance. The USGS shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to earth-science information. EERI shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to engineering information as provided by the engineering centers, institutions, and private practice. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program along with the USGS regional and National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) Web sites will be critically important sources of basic information for the news media and general public in the first few hours following a damaging earthquake. Commonly the demand for information surges several orders of magnitude during this period. In the past, the USGS has had difficulty in meeting this surge in demand; accordingly the USGS has recently contracted with a private vendor for web content distribution. It is important that the USGS continue to employ a web-content distribution strategy that is scaleable and designed to perform well during peak periods. This will ensure that the  media, the general public, and responding officials, all have information about what is happening as soon as it is available.  4.1.1.3 Technical Clearinghouse (USGS, FEMA, EERI) Within 1 day after a significant earthquake, a place should be established in the region affected by the earthquake where post-earthquake field investigators can meet to review progress and to organize and coordinate their activities. For very large events, multiple places might be appropriate. Such a field facility, known as a technical clearinghouse, is increasingly becoming part of the post-earthquake investigation culture in the United States (fig. 2). For purposes of coordination and safety, it is strongly recommended that all field investigators, regardless of affiliation, go through the clearinghouse before conducting field investigations. Formal clearinghouses were established after the 1994 Northridge, California, and 2001 Nisqually, Washington, earthquakes. Establishment of the technical clearinghouse is paramount to ensure an orderly post-earthquake technical reconnaissance that does not interfere with emergency response activities. To meet this goal, direct communication between the clearinghouse and state and Federal Disaster Coordinating Officers needs to be established and maintained. California has formalized the process for establishing a clearinghouse, with the principal NEHRP-sponsored participants being FEMA (Region IX), EERI, and the USGS (OES, 1998). Recently, the Western States Seismic Policy Council (WSSPC) and Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC) have sponsored efforts to formalize the clearinghouse process  Figure 2. Investigators meet at technical clearinghouse to discuss findings from field investigation of 2001 Nisqually, Washington, earthquake (photograph by Charles Scawthorn).  6   in their regions. WSSPC recently both adopted a policy that ""each state, province, and territory establish a plan for postearthquake clearinghouses to be activated within 24 hours after each major earthquake..."" (WSSPC, 2001) and published a model plan (http://www.wsspc.org/publicpolicy/committees/ clearinghouseplan.pdf). CUSEC, which coordinates earthquakerelated efforts of geological surveys in the central United States, is developing a regional plan that will identify a single point of contact following an event. The USGS, FEMA, and EERI shall work together on behalf of NEHRP and develop a general procedure for establishing a clearinghouse within 24 hours following a significant earthquake. The procedure shall be formulated in collaboration with state emergency management, state geological surveys, and appropriate multi-state consortia. The degree of leadership or responsibility by NEHRP entities for a specific event will depend on the level of involvement of non-Federal agencies in the clearinghouse. In cases where the states have a clearinghouse plan and resources, a state may take the lead in establishing the clearinghouse, with NEHRP and its affiliated agencies being partners in that effort. In other cases where states are not prepared to establish a clearinghouse, NEHRP shall take the lead in establishing the clearinghouse, with participation as available from state and local agencies. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will coordinate with the clearinghouse to the extent possible. Both the specific design and operation of the clearinghouse are the responsibility of the participants, but general operational plans must be prepared in advance by the USGS, FEMA, and EERI, if a fully functional clearinghouse is to be quickly established. With regards to NEHRP-supported investigations, EERI shall take responsibility for the engineering and socioeconomic aspects of the operation, and the USGS shall take responsibility for the earth science aspects. It is crucial that NEHRP funding agencies encourage funded centers, groups, and individuals to coordinate their activities with either EERI or the USGS through the clearinghouse. It is especially important that academic investigators, students, and technical representatives of the earthquake engineering research and education centers [Mid-America Earthquake Center (MAE), Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER), and Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER)] and earthquake earth science centers and organizations [Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), and the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO)] contribute and participate in the coordination efforts. These centers and organizations comprise a valuable assembly of multidisciplinary expertise in earthquake investigations. In addition, students from these centers can gain first-hand experience and provide valuable support to the technical clearinghouse. USGS shall formalize agreements with the major NEHRP-affiliated earth science centers and organizations to facilitate coordination; EERI shall formalize agreements with the major NEHRP-affiliated engineering centers and professional groups, such as the Technical Council  on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering (TCLEE), that routinely investigate earthquakes. It is critically important that these centers and organizations develop plans for post-earthquake investigations and share them with EERI and the USGS. Finally, at the time of an event, participation of faculty and students from universities and colleges, who are not affiliated with either earthquake engineering or earth science centers and organizations, will be welcomed. Both the operational relation and physical proximity of the technical clearinghouse to the Disaster Field Office (DFO) need to be considered when the clearinghouse is established. Some information collected during the Phase I activity may be relevant to decisions being made at the DFO. Coordination of the clearinghouse with the DFO may also provide a basis for a state's request that the clearinghouse be given a mission assignment by the appropriate state emergency services agency and thereby qualify the clearinghouse for partial funding support from disaster relief funds authorized by the 1974 Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, et seq.). If the earthquake is substantial and receives prominent coverage by the news media, many foreign researchers can be anticipated to visit. The USGS, EERI, and state agencies shall arrange at the clearinghouse to welcome, orient, and possibly brief these visitors about potential sites for their inspection and study as well as safety concerns. Close coordination between U.S. and foreign efforts can augment U.S. expertise and provide assistance with NEHRP post-earthquake investigations. Information directing visiting scientists and engineers to the clearinghouse should be posted on the event Web site.  4.1.1.4 NEHRP Investigations Coordinator (USGS) Within 1 day of a significant earthquake, a NEHRP Investigations Coordinator shall be designated by the USGS. The USGS shall maintain a list of suitable candidates, both in and out of the Federal service, and ensure that a mechanism is available to retain the full-time services of each individual on short notice for a minimum of 1 month. Preparation of the list and selection of the Coordinator shall be done in consultation with FEMA, NSF, and NIST. The Coordinator shall be an individual with broad technical background, previous post-earthquake investigation experience, and a thorough awareness of the capabilities of the various NEHRP agencies and their affiliated centers and organizations. The primary responsibilities of the Coordinator are (1) to ensure that disaster response activities are not impeded by scientific and technical investigations, (2) to provide emergency managers with timely and relevant information from the ongoing field investigations, (3) to facilitate coordination of NEHRP agencies, (4) to ensure that NEHRP press releases are coordinated and consistent, and (5) to work with scientific and engineering leaders to identify critical investigations and gaps in the ongoing investigation. Because it is impossible to delegate authority to the Investigations Coordinator under NEHRP, program managers in each NEHRP agency must work closely and cooperatively with the Coordinator to take advantage of the broad perspective of the Coordinator.  7   The advent of the Internet has greatly facilitated timely communication and reporting during natural disasters. Most organizations involved in post-earthquake investigations routinely provide daily situation reports on findings, progress, and difficulties encountered. Most of these reports are issued as e-mail. The Coordinator shall be (1) informed by each NEHRP agency about the scope of their post-earthquake investigation and (2) copied on all e-mail reports from supervisory field personnel and planning staff when possible. The Investigations Coordinator must also be kept abreast of activities at the technical clearinghouse. In summary responsibilities of the Investigations Coordinator are to:  Ensure that liaison with the Federal and State Coordinating Officials (FCO and SCO) and state and local emergency managers is established promptly. The purposes of the liaison activity are to ensure that NEHRP field efforts do not impede emergency response and recovery management and that relevant scientific and technical assessments from the field investigators are appropriately communicated to emergency managers. In addition to the scientific and technical assessments, some physical resources may be useful for emergency response. For example, it may be of value to make emergency managers aware of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory portable real-time aftershock warning system that can be shipped on short notice to an impacted area1. If a state has already established a liaison person for scientific and technical investigations, the Coordinator should work with the designated state liaison person.  Identify duplication and gaps in initial field reconnaissance and work with NEHRP program managers and state agencies to improve coordination and rectify shortcomings.  Work with NEHRP and state agencies and Federal, state, and local emergency managers to ensure that news releases are consistent and helpful to the public.  Convene and report results from Phase II meeting (see 4.1.2.1).  Congress anticipated the Act to be applicable to building failures caused by earthquakes. In section 2(c)(1)(J) of the Act, it specifies that the NIST Director develop implementing procedures that ""provide for coordination with Federal, State, and local entities that may sponsor research on investigations of building failures, including research conducted under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977."" In addition, Committee Report 107-530, published by the House Science Committee on June 25, 2002, states that ""The Director should clearly define how earthquake researchers and Teams will carry out their responsibilities in a coordinated fashion in cases where building failures have been caused by an earthquake."" The purpose of the Act is to (1) establish the likely technical cause or causes of the building failure, (2) evaluate the technical aspects of evacuation and emergency response failures, (3) recommend as necessary specific improvements to building standards, codes and practices, and (4) recommend any research and other appropriate actions needed to improve the structural safety of buildings and improve evacuation and emergency response procedures, based on the findings of the investigations. The Act requires that NIST issue a public report no later than 90 days after completing an investigation. Within 48 hours, NIST will examine the relevant factors associated with building failures that occur as a result of the earthquake and will make reasonable efforts to consult with the other NEHRP agencies prior to determining whether to conduct an investigation under the Act. Any NIST investigation conducted under the authority of the Act will be limited to building failures on one or more buildings or on one or more class or type of buildings selected by NIST. 4.1.2 Phase II  4.1.2.1 Phase II Meeting (NEHRP Investigations Coordinator) When initial reconnaissance activities have been completed and initial assessments of earthquake effects and damage have been made, typically within a few days to a week, it will be the responsibility of the Investigations Coordinator to convene a meeting to identify opportunities and needs for further investigation and concentrated data gathering. This meeting should involve leaders of the field efforts and include representatives from the USGS, FEMA, NIST, NSF, EERI, earthquake engineering research and education centers, earth science centers, IRIS, UNAVCO, state agencies, multi-state consortia, and groups representing the earth science, engineering, and social sciences communities. The meeting is referred to in figure 1 as the Phase II meeting. The primary purpose of the meeting is to identify important or unique geologic and seismologic effects, damage to the built environment, and societal impacts for which concentrated short-term investigations and data gathering are required to ensure that important information is collected before it is lost or obliterated. It is particularly important to identify opportunities to collect important perishable data, such as data on structural and lifeline performance, aftershocks, and ground failure, including fault rupture and secondary deformation. These are investigations  4.1.1.5 National Construction Safety Team Act (NIST) Prompted by the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001, Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team Act, which was signed into law on October 1, 2002. The Act authorizes the Director of NIST to establish and deploy a Team to investigate the failure of a building or buildings that has resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential for substantial loss of life. To the maximum extent practicable, the Director shall establish and deploy a Team within 48 hours after such an event.  1 The aftershock warning system consists of a base station and 8 remote stations. A self-contained broadcasting system sends signals to pagers within 60 miles of the base station. The pagers provide as much as a few seconds warning of potentially hazardous shear-wave arrivals from aftershocks. The pager signals can be used as switches for either automatic response or to emit noise and flashing light.  8   that must be conducted quickly before effects and damage are obliterated by recovery efforts and natural processes. In retrospect, important data have been lost following past earthquakes that could have been used to develop better engineering criteria and other hazard mitigation tools. As a consequence, valuable lessons were not learned and many needed tools to reduce losses and casualties have not been developed. Within 24 hours after the meeting, the Investigations Coordinator shall prepare a brief summary of the meeting for the NEHRP agencies that describes (1) major preliminary findings of the reconnaissance teams and (2) opportunities for further investigations identified by participants in the meeting. The summary shall consider hazard mitigation and risk management priorities in applicable local and state hazard mitigations plans while identifying investigation priorities. The report shall include an estimate of the level of additional support required to pursue these opportunities. On the basis of this report of the Investigations Coordinator, NSF, the USGS, EERI, the earthquake engineering research and education centers, and earth science centers shall work jointly to optimize the collection of perishable data. If recommendation 4 (see 5.4) to seek additional funds to increase the level of post-earthquake support is successful (or if supplemental funds are appropriated), it is recommended that a statement, which is jointly prepared by FEMA, USGS, NSF, and NIST, of opportunity for directed data collection be posted on the USGS and EERI event Web sites and the NSF Web site soliciting statements of qualifications and funding requests from groups or organizations willing to conduct data gathering. This statement of opportunity should specifically identify urgent investigations and note that funding decisions will be made quickly by the process described in recommendation 4. Data gathering teams responding to this statement of opportunity will typically include professors and students, representatives from both the earthquake engineering research and education and earth science centers, representatives of state and Federal agencies, personnel from professional organizations, and groups from engineering and other private firms. If recommendation 4 is not successful (or if supplemental funds are not appropriated), the report should be used to take maximum advantage of available NEHRP and other resources. These resources include those of (1) NSF, which may supplement existing research contracts and award both new peer-reviewed grants and Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER), (2) USGS, which redirects agency personnel and their research funding, (3) FEMA, whose engineering studies support recovery as specified under the Stafford Act, (4) NIST, which has the authority to conduct building investigations, and (5) the earthquake engineering and earth science centers, which provide support from discretionary funds. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will use its available resources for the conduct of its investigation. In addition, the NSF award to EERI to support the Learning from Earthquakes Program now includes funding for a few small grants for post-earthquake data collection. Because these resources are collectively modest and typically do not pro-  vide for comprehensive documentation of earthquake damage and effects, it is imperative that they be directed towards investigations of highest priority. This will require that these institutions work together before making awards. To improve the utility of data gathered during Phase II, NEHRP needs to standardize formats for data gathering and archiving. This is the purpose of recommendations 1, 2, and 3 (see 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3). We strongly encourage the NEHRP agencies to begin developing these standards and a process for electronically archiving these data before NEHRP is confronted by the next significant earthquake. While the success of recommendation 4 would provide funding that could support implementation of this activity, planning must be completed before the next earthquake.  4.1.2.2 Budget Supplemental Decision (FEMA, NIST, NSF, USGS) If the earthquake presents opportunities for investigations that would improve earthquake risk mitigation, but which cannot be supported with existing funds, the NEHRP agencies shall convene and consider a request for a budget supplement within a few days after the earthquake. The meeting shall be convened when field reports are adequate to make strategic decisions about these opportunities. This meeting will be unnecessary if the potential permanent funding sources have been established (see 5.4). 4.1.3 Phase III  4.1.3.1 Workshop for Setting Investigation Priorities (NSF, USGS, FEMA, NIST) Establishing priorities for long-term investigations, development, and implementation strategies following significant earthquakes is an important challenge for NEHRP. Large damaging earthquakes typically provide many opportunities to improve the understanding of earthquakes and their impacts. The NEHRP agencies (NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA) and appropriate state agencies and multi-state consortia shall jointly sponsor a workshop of earth scientists, engineers, and social scientists within 1 to 2 months of significant earthquakes to discuss priorities for long-term (Phase III) research and development opportunities presented by the earthquake. The workshop shall consider priority initiatives in applicable local and state hazard mitigation plans when evaluating investigation priorities. The format adopted in the EERI workshops following recent foreign earthquakes is a possible model that might be supported by NEHRP. These EERI 2-day workshops have served effectively to identify the most promising research opportunities--those that have the greatest potential to improve the current state of knowledge and practice throughout the world's seismic zones. The results of the NEHRP workshop will be presented immediately afterwards in a report that identifies major needs and opportunities for investigation, with a recommended set of priorities for funding. Within the constraints of available funding, a joint statement shall be issued soliciting long-term research and inves-  9   tigations. Funding shall be made within approximately 5 months of the event. The internal post-earthquake research activities of the USGS, FEMA, and NIST shall be coordinated with externally supported research of the NEHRP funding agencies.  4.1.3.2 Information Dissemination (USGS, NIST, NSF, FEMA) The publication and dissemination of findings from NEHRP post-earthquake investigations currently are both inconsistent and incomplete. Research findings are published in a wide variety of journals in a more or less timely manner, but official publications of the participating organizations often are not available until years after the event. This significantly reduces their potential impact on both earthquake-related knowledge and loss-reduction policy. This plan envisions that three different types of publications will be issued either under the aegis of or with facilitation by NEHRP for every significant domestic earthquake (these are not meant to preclude publication of institutional reports like those currently prepared after significant earthquakes):  Three-Month Event Summary--An event summary for a broad audience shall be published within 3 months of a significant earthquake. The summary should be well illustrated, comprehensive, and integrate preliminary observations on the seismological processes controlling the event and the response of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments. It is recommended that the event summary be prepared under the leadership of the USGS and EERI with formal collaboration of FEMA, NIST, and other NSFfunded entities. For example, the contributions of all of the major engineering and earth science investigative efforts supported under NEHRP should be integrated and incorporated. The USGS and EERI should designate editors within 1 week of the event, but co-editors from contributing agencies and centers should be included to facilitate agency participation. The summary is intended as a multidisciplinary document covering the earth sciences, engineering, and social sciences. It is not intended to substitute for institutional reports such as the EERI reconnaissance report, the USGS circular, and center reports that currently are produced following significant earthquakes.  One-Year Conference Proceedings--Because of the opportunity to implement change in the aftermath of disasters, FEMA, NIST, NSF, and the USGS will encourage and support local and state agencies in sponsoring a public conference with a proceedings on the 1-year anniversary of a significant earthquake. The conference should identify and synthesize the policy implications of the event for earthquake risk reduction. NEHRP agencies shall participate and provide support to the state agencies as needed to promote a successful conference. The conference and proceedings would be analogous (but without the legal implications) to transportation disaster assessments by agencies, like the National Transportation Safety Board, that investigate transportation accidents to determine causality. Another model is the 1995 Earthquake Information Exchange Workshop,  which was held following the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. The anniversary conference should be held in the region impacted by the earthquake and the content of the conference should be designed to target an audience of local and state policymakers in addition to Federal stakeholders. It is also expected that NEHRP will sponsor technical conferences, as is the current practice.  Comprehensive Synthesis (3 to 5 Years)--A comprehensive report that consists of one or more volumes that synthesize the results and findings from studies carried out by the research and professional practice communities shall be published within 3 to 5 years of the event by the USGS and NIST, with assistance from NSF and FEMA. The cost of this publication shall be shared among the NEHRP agencies. The report shall emphasize the significant contributions of the post-earthquake investigations to the knowledge base on earthquakes and earthquake loss reduction and bring relevant data together in a summary fashion. The report shall be coordinated with the data archive discussed later (see 5.3) where detailed investigations of representative structures, including plans, design criteria, estimated force distributions, and displaced shapes could be presented. The report should contain overviews of important findings derived from research on earth sciences and on the built and socioeconomic environments. This synthesis should include an extensive bibliography of the post-earthquake publications and should focus both on damage and disruption and on situations where the built environment performed well and little or no damage occurred. A comprehensive Phase III synthesis is important for several purposes to researchers and practitioners, including providing both rapid entry into the literature on the earthquake and overviews of studies that have been conducted in different disciplinary areas. A synthesis also distills significant lessons learned for future research, practice, and loss-reduction policy. Finally, NEHRP shall publicize the report to both the research and practice communities. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will contribute to the publications described above to the extent possible. 4.2 Foreign Earthquakes NEHRP supports investigations of foreign earthquakes because they often provide special opportunities to validate models and to learn about both the performance of specific aspects of the built environment and the geologic and seismologic processes that will have implications for earthquake risk mitigation in the United States. Cost and logistics generally limit the size of NEHRP foreign postearthquake investigations. Federal agencies generally do not participate unless officially invited by the impacted country. These factors cause tremendous differences in the character of individual investigations. At one extreme, investigations are modest and limited to small EERI reconnaissance teams, as for example, with the 1992 Erzincan,  10   Figure 3. Activities timeline for EERI post-earthquake activities--Foreign earthquakes.  Turkey, earthquake. At the other end of the spectrum, affected foreign governments request U.S. assistance and these investigations have foreign policy implications, as with the 1988 Armenia, USSR, 1995 Kobe, Japan2, and 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquakes. In the latter situation, some of the investigating teams are representatives of the U.S. Government while others, who are not covered by the request, are independent. Failure to coordinate schedules of field teams may lead to interference with the work of local experts and is the principal operational issue for NEHRP-supported foreign deployments. U.S. institutions typically respond independently in the earth sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Field parties supported by the EERI Learning from Earthquakes Program, the three earthquake engineering research and education centers (MAE, MCEER, and PEER), SCEC, CERI, IRIS, UNAVCO, as well as individuals with small NSF grants for exploratory research (SGER) may all visit earthquake-damaged areas with Federal funding support. In addition, the USGS, NIST, private firms from both the U.S. and foreign countries, and research entities from foreign countries commonly deploy field teams. The uncoordinated deployment of U.S. citizens has prompted complaints by affected countries to the U.S. Department of State. In its recent award to EERI for the Learning from Earthquakes Program, the Civil and Mechanical Systems directorate of NSF requested that EERI coordinate investigators funded by that directorate. In investigations in Turkey in 1999 and India in 2001, EERI has increasingly served as a point of contact for foreign post-earthquake 2 In this case, the Japanese request for U.S. Government assistance was delayed for more than a month following the event.  investigations. This plan recommends that NEHRP expand this EERI role. This plan recommends that each NEHRP agency request all of its post-earthquake investigators to inform EERI of plans and schedules of their investigations before departure as well as their ongoing status once they are in the field. EERI shall report these planned activities and their status regularly to the NEHRP agencies and post this information on its Web site. Because authority to influence schedules rests with the NEHRP funding agencies, the agencies shall review proposed plans for their potential impact on the proposed country. Although it is beyond the scope of the NSF mandate to EERI, this plan encourages EERI to keep local technical and scientific personnel abreast of U.S. activities, to involve them in these activities where possible, and encourage them to communicate relevant findings directly to the government of the country affected by the disaster. These communications from local personnel may be useful for reconstruction as well as encourage mitigation of future losses. It is noted that EERI in its Learning From Earthquakes Proposal to NSF has strengthened the coordination role of the EERI Team Leader and group leaders for each of the disciplines. In the field they solicit cooperation with other investigators. In preparing the preliminary and final EERI reports, they solicit and coordinate contributions from others who participated in field investigations. The EERI Team Leader also plays a significant role in helping to coordinate the second phase of data collection by making contact with each of the investigative teams before they enter the field and maintaining contact with them during field investigations by e-mail and phone. The EERI Team Leader offers to direct these investigators to areas that require further investigation before perishable data are lost. The approach allows researchers to collect data in several  11   waves, improving the comprehensiveness of the documentation of earthquake impacts. Coordinating field investigations and drawing on contributions from other teams ensures a clear understanding of damage and impacts, less duplication, less disruption of local emergency response and research efforts, more effective utilization of limited research funding, and a more comprehensive report on the earthquake. The EERI post-earthquake investigation plan is shown in figure 3.  compiled. Documentation of the seismic performance of nonstructural components in facilities is particularly lacking. This failure to document fully the physical impacts of an earthquake has serious consequences because full-scale testing of the performance of engineered systems under dynamic loading is often impractical. Because damaging earthquakes are infrequent, each failure to systematically document damage is a lost opportunity to improve:  Performance-based design.  Loss estimation.  Safety assessments of badly damaged structures. The current trend in earthquake engineering is to base seismic risk evaluations and design decisions on the predicted behavior of structures and their components during assumed levels of earthquake ground shaking. This approach, called performance based earthquake engineering, shows great promise as a framework to enhance the ability of both the private and public sectors to identify and to quantify levels of risk, to develop cost-effective strategies for risk reduction activities, and to implement efficient seismic rehabilitation. Yet these techniques rely completely on assumptions on the part of engineers of the actual performance of the built environment. An overly optimistic view can overlook significant risks or lead to ineffective designs. In the other extreme, excessive conservatism leads to unnecessarily high costs or, worse yet, inaction in the face of a seemingly insurmountable problem. Effective decisions on the part of building owners and managers, insurance and financial institutions, and public policymakers require realistic predictions of expected behavior in a statistical context. Extensive documentation of actual behavior, good and bad, of a broad range of structures subjected to real earthquakes will provide the data to meet this critical need. These data that document performance of the built environment are also essential for improving earthquake loss estimation models. Predictions of earthquake impacts with computer-based loss estimation models are becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors because the rarity of large damaging earthquakes does not permit robust actuarial estimates of future losses. Comprehensive documentation of the impacts of future earthquakes will improve model-based estimates of structural and nonstructural damage, casualties, and financial loss. Documentation of the performance of the socioeconomic environment also is very incomplete. Increasingly post-earthquake investigations include social, organizational, and economic issues, but much more progress is needed. For example, despite their obvious importance, relatively little emphasis is currently being placed on the systematic collection of data on earthquake-related deaths and injuries, both for U.S. and foreign earthquakes. The same can be said for other topics of major societal relevance such as the short- and longterm social and economic impacts of earthquakes, including impacts on regional economies, communities, households, and businesses. Because of its importance, the organization  5. Recommendations for Further Action At the March 13-14, 2001, invitational workshop held to provide input for this draft plan, participants identified several aspects of NEHRP post-earthquake investigations that are deficient. These deficiencies diminish the potential contribution of NEHRP to risk reduction in the United States. Aspects in need of improvement include the following:  Comprehensiveness--Investigations of earthquake impacts do not comprehensively cover all aspects of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments.  Efficiency--Emerging new information and technologies can greatly increase the quality and quantity of data collection, while lowering costs.  Data storage and retrieval--Much of the data that has been collected in past earthquakes has been effectively lost. If data collection is to become even more comprehensive, data management, archiving, and linking to existing data must be improved. The following recommendations propose solutions to these interrelated deficiencies. The objectives of the first 3 recommendations are to improve the scope (Recommendation 1), the quality and quantity (Recommendation 2), and the utility (Recommendation 3) of data acquired during post-earthquake investigations. Recommendation 4 proposes mechanisms for funding these improvements. 5.1 Recommendation 1--Broaden Coverage and Comprehensiveness of Investigations of Earthquake Impacts  Issue--Impacts on built and socioeconomic environments are not well documented Research on the impacts of earthquakes on the natural environment (for example, seismology, ground motion, and permanent ground deformation) is relatively well organized and documented by NEHRP because the USGS has both budgetary and operational responsibility in this area. The result has been significant improvement by both USGS and non-USGS scientists in the basic understanding of the natural consequences of earthquakes, such as shaking and permanent ground deformation. In contrast, performance data on the built environment (for example, buildings and lifelines) are not systematically  12   and effectiveness of emergency response and relief activities should be routinely documented.  Potential Solutions Built Environment Two aspects of structural performance surveys are particularly important--(1) adequate inventories of the building stock and others structures at risk and (2) systematic documentation and compilation of both damaged and undamaged structures. The lack of adequate data inventories hampers assessment of the significance of observed damage in many cases. Inventories make it possible to characterize the damage data and place it in proper context. For example, the knowledge that 1,000 steel buildings in the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, suffered significant damage is incomplete information and fails to answer questions such as ""How many steel buildings were subject to strong ground shaking?"" or ""Where were the damaged buildings located relative to the fault?"" Fortunately, with the increasing application of standardized procedures for (1) seismic design of structures, (2) preevent evaluation and rehabilitation of structures [see FEMA 310 (ASCE,1998a) and 356 (ASCE, 1998b)], (3) post-event evaluation and repair of structures [FEMA 306/307/308 (ATC, 1998a,b,c)], and (4) damage prediction [FEMA 154 (ATC, 1988), HAZUS (HAZUS, 1999)], a framework is emerging in the United States for both the collection of performance data and the development of inventories. For example, HAZUS, which was developed by FEMA to standardize loss estimates from earthquakes and other natural hazards, provides a framework for inventories of facilities and the description of performance. This plan recommends that NEHRP adopt a format for documenting performance that is consistent with these methodologies. It also recommends that NEHRP through FEMA also promote the development of robust inventories of structures by working with HAZUS users groups and others who have adopted and adapted these procedures. Important work in these areas is already ongoing at the NSF-funded earthquake engineering and research and education centers. This plan recommends that the systematic documentation and compilation of damaged and nondamaged structural performance, as well as the documentation of earthquake resisting properties of structures, be spearheaded by FEMA and NIST, because the data also would ultimately be used to improve building codes and standards and practices for structures and lifelines. The format for this documentation shall be established by FEMA and NIST before the next earthquake and could be similar to the ATC-38 post-earthquake building performance assessment form (ATC, 2000) and the EERI clearinghouse report form (S. McAfee, written commun., 2001; EERI, 1996). The actual surveys could be conducted by a contract with engineering organizations, such as American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), National Council of Structural Engineers Association (NCSEA), and ATC under the supervision of FEMA and NIST. In the absence of the success of Recommendation 4 for supplemental funding, it is unclear how the postearthquake damage surveys will be funded.  The extensive and detailed information on the damage to facilities that is routinely compiled by FEMA as a part of the disaster assistance funding process and by private structural engineering and design firms are existing valuable sources of information that are not currently available for research purposes. Coordination with FEMA and private firms to capture these data would provide a large source of additional data3. Once the collection of data on the built environment is improved, the data must be appropriately archived and made available. This can be accomplished by promotion of a NEHRP database (see Recommendation 3). Socioeconomic Environment A wider range of disciplines and specialists also needs to be incorporated into post-earthquake reconnaissance activities. Although there has been movement in the direction of greater disciplinary diversity, post-earthquake reconnaissance activities are undertaken primarily by earth scientists and engineers. Groups that remain underrepresented in post-earthquake investigations include public health specialists (such as epidemiologists), researchers from the various social science disciplines (for example, economics, sociology, geography, and political science), and experts from the emergency management and public policy communities. Mechanisms must be established to encourage greater participation by investigators with expertise in the social science and public health fields, experts in economic modeling, and others who can contribute to the collection and analysis of data on the pre- and post-impact social environment. NEHRP should coordinate and work with organizations involved in studying the socioeconomic and public health aspects of disasters to recruit and train a cadre of qualified health and social science investigators who can participate in future post-earthquake studies. A partial list of these organizations include the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of California at Los Angeles Center for Public Health and Disasters, leading social science centers such as the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado and hazardfocused geographic information system (GIS) laboratories such as the Hazards Research Lab at the University of South Carolina, and professional associations such as the International Research Committee on Disasters. As an initial step, EERI should initiate outreach efforts aimed at informing social science and public health researchers about NEHRPrelated post-earthquake data collection opportunities and more effectively integrate members of these groups into postearthquake investigations. EERI should also seek input from social scientists on how to improve the quantity and quality of data that are collected on the societal aspects of earthquakes. As is the case with other disciplines involved in post-earthquake investigations, new protocols are needed to ensure that the data-collection strategies and instruments that are used to 3 Previous studies have emphasized the need for systematic collection and compilation of economic impacts (see NRC, 1999).  13   obtain data on the social, economic, and health impacts of earthquakes are standardized, so that comparisons can be made across time and across earthquake events. Existing documents such as the EERI Post-earthquake Investigation Field Guide outline in broad terms the types of social and economic impact data that should be obtained during the post-earthquake reconnaissance phase. This guide should be reviewed, revised, and expanded to incorporate a broader range of social science data as well as to provide more systematic frameworks for recording those data. When revised, the guide should be distributed widely within the social science research community. Agencies that sponsor post-earthquake investigations should also recognize that gaps in knowledge exist because many disciplines and topics lack adequate funding. In making funding decisions, NEHRP agencies should examine how to ensure better disciplinary coverage so that significant research topics--including those focusing on the socioeconomic environment--are not overlooked. Both the Investigations Coordinator and the entities responsible for organizing the Phase II and III meetings to set priorities shall be responsible for ensuring that significant socioeconomic issues are included in the research plans that are developed and that adequate funding is available to support that work. Finally, societal impact data must be placed in a larger context. For example, this could be done through the systematic collection of data on both pre- and post-event characteristics of affected communities, populations, and economies. 5.2 Recommendation 2--Encourage Use of Information Technology  spread of post-earthquake fires and spills of hazardous materials.  Data on earthquake casualties and on other social and economic impacts.  Potential Solution Advances in information technologies now permit rapid, cost-effective collection and analysis of virtually exhaustive data sets in each of the above categories. A few examples of current, but only recently available technologies include the following:  PDA-GPS-digital camera technology to permit standardized but rapid and extensive digital descriptions of georeferenced damage data for regional and detailed structure and lifeline damage studies.  Remote sensing (for example, InSAR, LIDAR) for compilation of inventories of the visible built environment before and immediately after the main event, for regional assessments of damage.  Digital recording and near-real-time dissemination of strong shaking measurements throughout the affected built environment during the occurrence of damage from the main earthquake to provide the quantitative recordings needed for emergency response, performance-based engineering, and the rebuilding of a safer society.  High-resolution low-altitude vertical and oblique aerial photographs as a mandatory part of the NEHRP post-earthquake reconnaissance, to be made available free on the Internet.  On-site digital video image capture by special imagecapture vans with mounted digital cameras to document building status on both sides of a street immediately following the event.  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data for understanding of the real-time impacts and response to earthquakes of distributed systems such as gas, water, and wastewater systems. SCADA systems have emerged as a typical feature of lifeline networks over the last several decades--the data are generally available but have been little used for studying the effects of earthquakes, damage and post-earthquake response, and demands on distributed systems. It should also be mentioned that while not observational data, both ShakeMap and HAZUS results can be valuable adjuncts to post-earthquake investigations (in addition to emergency response). Existing GIS inventories of the built environment can guide comprehensive inspection and data collection for essential facilities and infrastructure. These are only a few examples of relatively new technologies that can be used more effectively in post-earthquake investigations. IT is developing so rapidly that new tools and applications are emerging constantly. In order to enhance post-earthquake investigations and analyses, this plan recommends that NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA support ongoing research into applications of IT and ways to analyze and use  Issue--Information Technology (IT) offers opportunities to improve collection of data Data that are amenable to collection using remote sensing, digital imaging, global positioning system, and other new and emerging technologies are distributed widely within the natural, built, and social environments. A wide variety of data, which previously could not be collected or only collected at great effort, can now be collected and analyzed rapidly, often in near-real time. Examples include the following:  Regional geodetic and geological effects.  Recordings of strong shaking on the ground and in engineered structures during the main shock.  Aftershocks.  Ground deformations associated with faulting, liquefaction, landslides, and shaking.  Direct and indirect damage to structures and lifelines (both in a regional statistical sense and in detailed studies of selected structures).  System responses, such as pressures and flows in gas, water, and wastewater systems, telephone demand surges, and traffic patterns.  Collateral dynamic phenomena, such as growth and  14   the collected data. The NSF-funded earth science organizations and earthquake engineering research and education centers provide excellent resources for this effort. We also recommend that, in the immediate response to the event, NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA support equipment and other resource needs and facilitate access to and use of selected IT assets that may be beyond the resources of individual investigators (for example, if FEMA tasks national reconnaissance assets to fly over a domestic earthquake the imagery should be available to NEHRP-supported investigations to the maximum extent feasible). If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will support this solution to the extent possible. 5.3 Recommendation 3--Formalize Data Management and Archiving  retrievable from a single or mirrored Internet site using time stamps and a geocoded referencing system. NEED would be addressable with all of the tools of a modern GIS, as well as with modern relational database technology on the Internet. Researchers could contribute to it from any location, according to established quality control guidelines. NEED will fill the need for a permanent, interactively managed national and international archive for the unprecedented data sets to be collected from future damaging earthquakes. One approach to this effort would be to require each recipient of NEHRP funding (NSF grantee, the earthquake centers, USGS awardees, NIST, and others) to budget a percentage of the grant funds (for example, 1 or 2 per cent) for archiving raw and reduced data in NEED. Alternatives for management and maintenance of NEED include: (1) Integration into and management by the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). (2) Residency in the National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE), and with oversight by a board consisting of representatives of organizations such as MCEER, PEER, MAE, EERI, Seismological Society of America (SSA), ATC, and Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE). NEED could reside on the NISEE server with mirror servers on the MAE, MCEER, and PEER servers. (3) Residency in the NSF Digital Library for Earth Science Education (DLESE). The costs associated with implementing this solution range from research funding focused specifically on the integration of new technologies into post-earthquake investigations to providing funds for a workshop where investigators share information on their data collection and archiving strategies and to supporting a Web site where data-sharing will be accomplished. Each level of effort has an associated cost. Once the data repository format has been established, implementation of a consensus-based repository can be accomplished. Dedicated costs for creation and maintenance of NEED would be perhaps two staff-years to start, and one staff-year annually thereafter, with hardware and expenses perhaps in the tens of thousands of dollars annually. Contribution of data into NEED would be a distributed cost, borne by each contributing investigation. This plan recommends that all NEHRP-supported investigations be required to budget a small fraction of the investigation's overall costs for this purpose. 5.4 Recommendation 4--Funding to Support Post-Earthquake Investigations  Issue--Collected data are not well archived and therefore are effectively lost It is critical to develop strategies for the formal and systematic archiving of data collected during post-earthquake investigations. These data, which focus on the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments, address a wide variety of phenomena. The data are voluminous and are acquired in many forms (for example, digital recordings, digital images, clipboard survey sheets, photographs, and narratives). If not organized and archived soon after an earthquake event, these data are often lost. No mechanism currently exists either to archive these data or to make them readily accessible to the research community. Because of this failure to adequately document, preserve, and access data, an enormous volume of highly relevant data has been effectively lost.  Potential Solution Management of these data requires:  Research on cost-effective field data collection--Much of the initial data from post-earthquake investigations are collected on foot in the field. Use of georeferenced personal digital assistants and digital and video cameras with GPS capability and other efficient data collection tools should be encouraged by the development and free dissemination of standardized software applications and associated data protocols for use both in the field and for downloading data.  Development of a consensus-based repository for collected data--Rather than relying on physical repositories, technology now permits most data to be digitally recorded and stored. Therefore, this plan recommends the creation of a virtual web-based archive, analogous to the structure and functioning of the Consortium of StrongMotion Observation Systems (COSMOS) Virtual Data Center (http://db.cosmos-eq.org/). This new database, to be called the ""National Earthquake Experience Database"" (NEED) should be maintained at individual centers, but  Issue--Funding of post-earthquake investigations is inadequate The absence of readily available financial resources to fund immediate, short-term, and long-term post-earthquake investigations has resulted in the failure to collect valuable  15   data vital for development of earthquake disaster reduction measures and has handicapped substantial follow-up research investigations. For the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake, Congress enacted ""Emergency Supplemental Funds"" for use by the NEHRP agencies for post-earthquake investigations. The emergency supplemental funding provided by Congress following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was $20 million, of which $8 million was designated for post-earthquake investigations administered by USGS. The emergency supplemental funding provided by Congress following the 1994 Northridge earthquake was $13 million. It was recognized that this is neither the best nor the most efficient means to fund these efforts 4. The report to Congress by FEMA (1993), which was requested in the 1990 reauthorization bill, provides an excellent summary of the benefits of post-earthquake investigations and suggests several alternative approaches to establishing a fund for this purpose. It was clear that the four principal NEHRP agencies could not agree on a single best approach.  Potential Solution One possible solution for funding domestic post-earthquake investigations to be used when an earthquake has been designated as a Presidentially declared disaster could be obtained by establishing a separate fund during the next NEHRP reauthorization that could then be drawn upon for Federally-declared earthquake disasters; such funds could be administered by FEMA. Another possibility could be to designate and utilize existing agency programs to fund these activities. However, in the absence of such funds, all of the NEHRP agencies shall be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Such a template could be used as well for post-event investigations of other types of disasters, including natural and terrorist events, which would allow for the documentation of information that would help improve the protection of the Nation's infrastructure from future events. Foreign post-earthquake investigations could continue to be funded on a basis of need from each of the NEHRP agencies. Background--The issue of funding of post-earthquake investigations is a very significant one and received considerable attention at the March 2001 workshop and subsequently by the authors. One alternative that was explored but ultimately not included in the recommendations was the possibility of utilizing the Stafford Act to provide funds for post-disaster investigations. The amount of funds could be equal to 1 percent times the Section 406 disaster relief funds5. For the Loma Prieta earthquake this would have amounted to about $28 million, and for the Northridge earthquake it would have totaled about $60 million. The funds made available by such change in the Stafford Act 4 Public Law 101-614, National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Reauthorization Act, Section 11 (b), November 1990. 5 For comparison, Section 404 currently provides between 15 and 20 percent times the 406 expenditures for hazard mitigation grants. For the Northridge earthquake this amounted to about $722 million.  could also be used to provide post-disaster funds for disaster related investigations following other natural events such as hurricanes and, even more significantly, man-made events such as acts of terrorism. However, this alternative was not included in the report's recommendations because any proposed new language modifying the Stafford Act would require action by Congress, which is unlikely at the present time. Because the funding of post-earthquake investigations remains a crucial issue, this plan recommends that all NEHRP agencies be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Recommended Administration--With any of the funding mechanisms discussed above, this plan recommends that FEMA, as lead NEHRP agency, be responsible for the identification of investigation topics, distribution of the funds, and reporting of the results to Congress6. For earthquake disasters, it is recommended that the NEHRP Policy Coordinating Group, Presidentially appointed individuals from the four principal NEHRP agencies, create a standing nine-member post-earthquake investigation Selection Committee to assist FEMA in fulfilling these responsibilities. This Selection Committee shall be mobilized within days after a significant earthquake, attend all briefings, participate in the joint NSF/USGS/FEMA/NIST priority-setting workshop, and be responsible for identifying the basic and problem-focused investigation efforts required to maximize learning from the specific earthquake disaster. On the basis of the outcomes and recommendations of the workshop, the Selection Committee shall recommend to FEMA topical areas and funding levels for each area. FEMA would determine the funds to be allocated to each NEHRP agency. Each NEHRP agency shall be responsible for the identification of appropriate projects and investigators, administration of its grants, project supervision, and be accountable for funds allocated to their agency in their topical areas. They will actively contribute to the report to Congress. The nine members of the Selection Committee shall consist of one member from each of the four principal NEHRP agencies and at least four members from the non-Federal earthquake community.  6. Annual Review of Plan The United States historically has been fortunate that large damaging urban earthquakes have been infrequent. This is due more to the relatively recent formation of the United States as a nation than to a lack of seismicity. Potentially damaging earthquakes, such as the 1811-12 New Madrid sequence in the Midwest, the 1755 Cape Anne, Massachusetts, and 1886 Charleston, South Carolina, events on the east coast, the 1857 Fort Tejon event in southern CaliforFEMA currently reports to Congress on hazard-mitigation grant projects funded by Stafford Act Section 404 even though these projects are selected by the state for which the disaster has been declared and approved by FEMA before expenditure. 6  16   nia, and the 1700 mega-event in the Pacific Northwest, are all well documented, but occurred before major urban or suburban development of the regions. In modern times, the only large (M>7) earthquakes that affected U.S. cities were the 1906 San Francisco, California, and 1964 Good Friday, Alaska, earthquakes, both of which devastated cities. Smaller (M<7) but more frequent modern events, however, such as the 1971 San Fernando, 1989 Loma Prieta, 1994 Northridge, and 2001 Nisqually earthquakes, offer opportunities to learn how to reduce earthquake risk--the ultimate goal of NEHRP. Thus, opportunities to implement this proposed plan in its entirety will only happen irregularly. As normal turnover in NEHRP management occurs, however, new managers may be unfamiliar with the plan. Implementation of the plan is further complicated by NEHRP's lack of a line-management structure to activate this plan immediately after an event. Therefore, it is recommended that the NEHRP Interagency Coordinating Committee (ICC) review this plan annually, and after each review remind agency and institutional managers of their obligations under the plan. The annual review should also include an opportunity for comments from the professional and research community involved in earthquake risk mitigation. It is recommended that this annual review occur on the anniversary of the largest recorded earthquake in U.S. history, the March 27, 1964, Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. The annual review would provide opportunities to revise or modify the plan as appropriate. A fundamental tenet of emergency management is that the process and currency of planning are as important as the plan itself.

GX239-30-1843212	"Imaging  and Document Management         1.0 Background      1.1 Evolution of Imaging      Information has been recorded on paper for centuries. For the  past 60 years, much has been recorded on microfilm, and for 30  years on magnetic media (i.e., tape and disks). In each case new  media have provided an additional method of information storage,  but have not replaced the earlier media. The first imaging  implementations, file-cabinet replacement systems, were  expensive; therefore, there were low adoption rates.      Document imaging has historically been about the  use of scanning, storage and display technologies to automate  paper-intensive processes. In the early 1990s there was rapid  change and adoption of imaging technology began. Document imaging  has now joined a widely accepted set of tools and techniques.                           Tools            Techniques                          Workflow Routing            Business Processing Reengineering (BPR)                          Optical Character Recognition (OCR)            Workflow Automation                          Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)          Scanning             Document Management Process.                          CD-ROM Creations                                Core imaging technologies are becoming  components. Viewing has become a desktop commodity with vendors  such as Microsoft offering free viewing products. Imaging  products are now available for microcomputers, midrange systems  and mainframes. Organizations have an imaging free-for-all as  more imaging components arrive from related areas such as fax  software, World Wide Web-based documents and images, document  management tools and workflow-enabled processes, and as  application vendors and value-added resellers add image-enabled  processing to their standard plain-text offerings.      In 1995, the document imaging market underwent a  consolidation in which large vendors and rapidly growing vendors  gained market share. Major consolidations were:             IBM      bought Lotus        FileNet and      Watermark merged        Wang Laboratories      acquired Sigma Imaging        Wang and Microsoft      developed ImageVue        ViewStar and Caere      merged         The disparity between installed/legacy imaging systems and  newer imaging systems will be significant in terms of  functionality, integration and vendor support. Agencies  considering document imaging have a wide variety of options  available, and will be investing in imaging as it becomes  embedded in their current line-of-business applications.      Implementing image technology may require changes  in work habits, processes, business relationships, job content  and communications. How well an agency manages these issues will  determine its success in implementing imaging.      1.2 Current Trends    Delphi research on market size and growth in document  management, text retrieval, and workflow software areas shows  that in 1996:             Document      Management grew rapidly, at just over 40%, and was up 41% to      $341M ,        Text      search software grew over 20% and was up 21% to over $510M,      and        Workflow      showed a less dramatic increase at 14% and was up 14% to over      $933M.                On April 2, 1997 the Association for Information  and Image Management International (AIIM) announced the results  of its annual electronic imaging market report, which estimates  1996 total sales for the U.S. electronic imaging market to total  $3.0 billion, up from $2.6 billion in 1995. In addition to steady  overall growth, the AIIM report shows a dramatic shift in the  market towards broader use of the Microsoft Windows NT operating  system for imaging systems.       In last year's survey, Windows NT-based clients  comprised nine percent of installed systems. The study projects  that in 1997 a full 31 percent of imaging clients will run  Windows NT. The trend for servers is also pronounced:18 percent  of currently installed servers are running Windows NT, with 33  percent expected to do so in 1997. While desktop automation  software grew by the largest percentage, the production imaging  systems market maintained its commanding lead as the market's  largest segment, gaining nearly $280 million to reach $2.3  billion in 1996 revenue. The production imaging segment includes  the industry's biggest names -- such as FileNet, IBM, Mosaix  (ViewStar) and Wang (now Eastman Software) -- and provides the  software and services that typically integrate the routing of  documents into high-volume, transaction business processes.       The AIIM survey also explored return on  investment (ROI) figures. Half of the survey's respondents  indicated their organizations conducted an ROI analysis prior to  installing their imaging systems, with 17 percent of respondents  following up with a post-installation ROI audit. In nearly all  cases where users conducted a post-installation audit, they  replied that their expectations were either met or exceeded. The  study showed the average length of time needed for the systems to  pay for themselves was 2.6 years.       1.3 Advantages  and benefits.    Advantages . Document Imaging can  improve  efficiency,  customer service, document control, and decision making. At the  same time, imaging and document management can  reduce   clerical support, processing time, and storage space. The use of  imaging in state government can improve services by:             • reducing cycle time through automated      routing, data collection, input and output,       • improved access to information,        • improved quality by improved decision making,        • better access to information,        • enterprise-wide information sharing,       • improved reporting and analysis and consistent      document versions, and        • by decreasing non-value added activities and expanding      employee expertise.         Benefits . Imaging can provide many  benefits to state agencies and to outside entities requiring  quick access to information. Benefits include:             Document      of Record  - Agencies are the repository for critical      documents. With imaging and document management, these      documents can be stored securely, and can be retrieved      quickly.        Security  -      The physical document can be separated from the viewer.      Security can be tailored to each user, which is an impossible      task for paper-based documents.        Long-term      document storage  - Many documents in state government      must be retained for long periods of time, and must be made      readily available.        Productivity       - Budgets are not increasing, but agencies are tasked with      processing an increasing amount of work. Methods must be      found to handle the increase.        Efficient      collection  - Possibility of collecting more fines, fees      and taxes. Paper-based documents can be mishandled or      misplaced easily.        Reduced storage      space  - Because most documents can't be destroyed, space      requirements keep increasing. With document imaging, paper      can be either destroyed or moved to a less-expensive      location.        Information      access  - Multiple departments within agencies and      different agencies can have access to the same up-to-date      information.              2.0 Document  Imaging Concepts      Document imaging  is the process of  converting data from a paper format to a digital form. The image  of the paper document retains the same format and appearance as  the original. When paper is transformed into an electronic  version, it changes how the documents can be used and stored.      What is an Image Document?  A consensus has  emerged that documents no longer have to be paper, but instead  are defined as a collection of related items, often of different  types. A document can be a scanned image, a spreadsheet, a fax,  machine readable data, workflow, video or sound, just to name a  few.      Using document imaging technology to enhance  applications should be a major goal of the user community.  Gartner Group describes imaging's non-monetary benefits to be:                           Automation of work processes            Improved customer goodwill                          Collaborative joining of tasks from remote          sites             Improved management tracking tools                          Digital backup of all relevant documents            Improved organizational information access                          Electronic audit trails            Increased document-access security                          Heightened employee task satisfaction            Simultaneous access to the same document .                        3.0. Functions  Performed in an Imaging System                                      Examples of          Functionality in an Imaging System                                     Capture/Scanning             System administration                           Indexing             Conversion                          Forms Processing             Document Management                          Storage/Retrieval             Security                          Reporting             Backup & recovery                          Balancing & Verification             Workflow                    3.1  Capture/Scanning    Capture is one of the most important steps in the  imaging process. Unfortunately, most imaging systems focus on  storage, retrieval and workflow. Most systems support only low  and mid-range scanners.      Document capture affects the quality and  usefulness of the entire solution, but capture may be the most  expensive part of the system. Efficient capture equals lower  operating costs. Understand the issues before you implement,  detect and correct problems as close to the scanning process as  possible, and automate as much as possible. The solution chosen  must be (expand beyond a workgroup to the entire department or  enterprise), and the export module should be compatible with the  database(s) being used.                                                                                 Capture/ Scanning Issues                                                                                                                                         Document preparation                                              Scanning                                              Throughput                                              Batch processing vs. interactive                                              Resolution                                              Image enhancement                                              Data extraction                                                             Document Preparation  is an essential step  that is often overlooked. Document preparation is usually a  manual step that occurs prior to the start of document imaging.  This is a very important task that must be given careful thought  and planning. The way documents are prepared for scanning affects  the efficiency and throughput of the scanning and indexing  operations. Document preparation involves:              • Removing staples, repairing tears, and      separating the input into physical batches (i.e., by document      type, claim number, single-sided vs. two-sided)       • Photocopying small items, such as registered mail      receipts, onto 82 by 11 paper       • Performing any initial data entry, if required       • Date stamping the document, if required (most scanners      do not perform this function)       • Sorting by dept., destination, source, etc., for entry      into workflow       • Preparing separator sheets, patch pages, barcodes       • Counting pages or documents for batch balancing        • Preparing boxes for physical storage       • Delivering batches to the scan operator and picking up      the batches when complete.         Scanning  is the operation that precedes  digitization. Scanning involves having a scanner read each  document, converting the documents to electronic images, and  automatically forwarding the documents to a scan queue for  indexing. The scanner will have various settings for brightness,  contrast and scan density (200 dpi, 300 dpi, 600 dpi).      Imaging software will usually come with a scan  function. If this is the case, it is usually beneficial to write  an interface program to automate the scanning process to allow  users ease of selection of various scanning methods, queue  selection, page count verification, and batch accept/reject  capabilities prior to routing the scanning batches to the index  queue as part of the front-end quality control. Scanning software  that comes with an imaging package may not be suitable for a high  volume production scanning operation.      Scanning considerations:             • Scanning speed       • Image resolution       • Creation of a patch page       • Scanning of a Barcode       • The use of a printer/endorser.         Typical scanning tasks:                   Select the desired scanning method depending on the document      type. For example:                   • scan each page as a separate          document           • scan the entire batch as one multi-page document           • scan using OCR separator pages to identify the          start of each multi-page document contained in a          multi-document batch                     Set the scanner brightness and contrast (usually done at the      time the scanner is installed)         Select the      desired destination queue for the batch of documents         Monitor the      scanner for jams, double feeds, etc. Never leave the scanner      unattended.         After the batch      is scanned, either accept or reject the batch based on page      count         Be aware of      scanning options that can slow down scanning production. If      options such as deskewing or OCR are used, you may double the      time required to scan a batch of documents, which causes      significant loss of production.         Throughpu t is the amount of work  (documents) that can be scanned and information captured within a  certain time frame. Considerations:             • The overall throughput of the capture      process is limited by the slowest step in the process.       • The amount of document preparation that is necessary      can affect throughput.       • Batch processing using assembly-line method.       • Attended vs. unattended scanning.       • Understanding  pages  vs.  images  for      sizing.         Batch processing vs. interactive processing .  Interactive processing involves dynamic scanning and indexing of  each document, and is typical of low volume applications. Batch  processing involves breaking each job into smaller batches, and  is typical of high-volume, more complex applications. In batch  processing, specialists perform the same task on many batches  (indexing, rework).      Resolution  is the ability of a scanning or  image generation device to reproduce the details of an image. It  is also a measure of capability to delineate picture detail.  Considerations:             • 200 dpi is appropriate for most      applications.       • 300 dpi is the exception.       • High resolution affects scanning, storage, compression      and network performance.       • Most ICR is optimized for 200 dpi.       • Some OCR is more effective at 300 dpi.       • if 300 dpi is required for OCR accuracy, consider      scaling to 200 dpi after OCR.         I mage Enhancement   is the process of cropping, deskewing or filtering an image so  that the result is visually clearer than the original image. Some  imaging systems employ image enhancement algorithms to adjust  scanning thresholds and/or skewed images, thereby improving the  readability of the imaged document before recording them on  disks. Typical forms of image enhancement include:             • the suppression of isolated, randomly      occurring black spots that may result from low threshold      settings during scanning,       • image sharpening, which emphasize edges and small      imaging details,       • adaptive thresholding, which automatically adjusts the      scanning threshold to accommodate local variations in      contrast, and       • background filtration, which can have a favorable      influence on image compression by permitting high scanning      resolutions with less of a penalty in storage space      consumption.         Considerations:             • Can be hardware or software.       • No ""perfect"" setting is possible for mixed      documents.       • Using bitonal enhancement vs. grayscale.       • Enhancement for viewing or printing is not the same as      for OCR accuracy.         Data Extraction  can be achieved  automatically via barcode or OCR/ICR, or manually by data entry.  Considerations:             • Handprint vs. machine print       • Constrained fields vs. unconstrained       • Data validation       • Correction.         OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is the  ability of a computer to recognize written characters through  some optical-sensing device and pattern recognition software.      ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition) is a  technology that employs either software only or software and  hardware to automatically recognize and translate raster images  into structured data.      Why OCR?             • Worldwide, over 95% of all processed      information is only available in hardcopy form.       • The cost of entering data into an imaging systems is      the dominant life-cycle cost.       • OCR reduces the cost of converting data from hardcopy      into electronic form.                                          Difficulties in the use of              OCR                •   Unusual fonts               • Poor media quality               • Poor print quality               • Extraneous marks               • Reproduction distortions               • Context checking acronyms, proper names ,              technical terms, etc.                               OCR              Pre-processing steps                •   Page decomposition               • Deskew               • Image enhancement                               Page decomposition problems                • Text in boxes               • Signatures               • Mathematical equations               • Embedded graphics                               Image              enhancement objectives                • Reduce              extraneous information               • Compensate for degradations               • Enhance viability that aids in discriminating              characters                                                 <move to technical  section>      Anatomy of a Scanner Subsystem                            Engine vs.          Integrated Scanner                       Compression                           Image          Processing             Interfaces                           Image          Handling             Mechanics                           Buffering                                Image Types             $ Binary       $ Grayscale       $ Color       $ Grayscale/Color for documents         Measuring Scanner Speeds             $ Pager per minute       $ Pixel clock       $ Inches per second         Image Processing             $ Image brightness adjustment         - normalization for light  variation             $ Image filtering                           - sharpening           - thinning, smoothing                       $ Image despeckling         Deskewing             $ Binary vs, grayscale      deskewing       $ Skew detection                           - based on paper edges           - based on image data                       $ Skew removal         Border Removal             $ Black border edge trim       $ Folded corner detection       $ Pad to fill standard paper size       $ Scale to fill standard paper size       $ Scale to fit form template         Paper Handling             $ Jam detection/recovery       $ Double-feed detection       $ Modularity       $ Output stackers         Mechanical Features             $ Paper path; short, straight       $ Duplex without flipping       $ Feeder/transport/stacker       $ Transport type                           - vacuum, roller or belt                       $ Endorser; pre- vs.      post-image         3.2 Indexing    Indexing  is the step where each document is  given one or more identifying labels which will allow the  document to be located and retrieved later. It is recommended  that two or more index fields are used in the event that one  index is incorrect, the document can still be located using the  alternate index ( i.e., claim number, SSN, claimant name). Index  fields can be keyed manually, inserted automatically by a  customized program, or indexed using a combination of both  methods. Adequate quality control steps must be designed in the  process and put into use during the actual indexing to minimize  errors.      Typical indexing tasks include:             Open      the scan queue and retrieve each document to be indexed,        Examine the image      to ensure it is legible, else reject it and rescan,        Sight verify the      index values using the information on the imaged document,      snf        Save the image to      its folder and get the next image from the queue.         Indexing is a descriptive set of data associated  with a document for the purpose of identifying and locating the  document's location. Indexing can be used to consolidate  documents that may not be ""logically"" related, or that  may be stored in different locations, or on different media.  Indexing can be accomplished manually or automatically.      Indexing has the objective of guiding an end user  to the intellectual content and physical location of documents.  Imaged documents must be accessible for retrieval, processing,  routing and queuing, maintenance and reporting.      Types of indexing      Fixed  Indexing Fields             Processing      fields  contain information necessary to manage documents      in a computer from the system administrator's point of view      and to verify the documents' operational integrity        Retrieval      fields  contain information necessary for an end-user to      retrieve a document at a time after the document has been      stored.         Full  Text Indexing             Store      the entire text of all documents so that every character of      every word in every sentence of every document can be      located.        When an end-user      wants to retrieve information, all documents are searched and      documents containing the specified words are returned.         Hybrid Indexing             Combination      of fixed fields and full text indexing.         Steps to Successful Indexing      Step 1 :   Identify Retrieval Requirements             • Characteristics of documents       • Characteristics of document uses       • Current procedures for document retrieval       • Records retention and regulatory reporting       • Indexing quality requirements         Step 2 :   Plan  Index             • Type of index - fixed fields, full      text, or hybrid       • For fixed indexing fields:                   - Determine number of fields           - Define indexing vocabulary                       • Set indexing standards                           - ANSI/AIIM TR40-199X suggested index          fields for documents in Electronic Image Management (EIM)          environments           - ANSI/NISO Z39.50 Protocol.

Measuring your forms processing needs:               Who       is filling out the forms?          What       information is being collected?          Where  are      the forms coming from?          How many       forms will be processed?         Bottom Line -  can      it be automated?           Forms processing steps:             1. Input manual form via scanner.       2. Input electronic form (from a fax, the Internet, etc.).       3. Interpretation of the form.        4. Storage of the form.         Form field definition:                   Handprint (ICR) field         Machine print      field (OCR)         ""Check      Box"" field         3.4 Storage and Retrieval      Storage      When considering storage alternatives for your  imaging system, you must know the environment, the data storage  hardware options, the data storage software options, and be able  to ""put it all together."" Technical environment issues  must be addressed: capacity, performance, permanence and cost.      The two primary options for image storage are  magnetic and optical storage. Magnetic storage offers faster  access speeds than optical, but can be more expensive for a given  unit of storage and does not provide as high level of storage  capacity. ??? RAID?? Imaging systems will typical utilize a  combination of magnetic and optical storage to take advantage of  their capabilities: magnetic for the period when images need to  be accessed quickly and optical when large storage volumes are  needed, but retrieval time is less critical.      Storage requirements  for imaging  systems are unique:                   Lots of space is required         File sizes usually      vary from large to very large         There are a      variety of performance requirements         Permanent      archiving is often required         The imaging system      must remain cost competitive         Data storage hardware options  are:                   Magnetic disk drives and disk arrays         Optical disk and      optical disk libraries         CD-ROM towers and      libraries         Magnetic tape and      tape libraries         Magnetic disk drives and disk arrays  can  be groups of magnetic disks:             • stand-alone disks up to 9 GB,       • disk farms up to hundreds of terabytes, or       • magnetic disk arrays (RAID).         RAID  (Redundant Array of  Independent Disks) allows information to be written to multiple  drives and can protect your data from drive failure. Benefits of  RAID are:             • High availability of data (mission      critical)       • Data transfer rate is high (sequential)       • Data I/O rate is high       • High storage capacity       • Flexible         CD-ROM disks are used for low cost distribution  of information rather than storage or backup.      Optical disk and optical disk library   formats are:             • 3.5 inch optical disks       • 5.25 inch optical disks       • 12 inch optical disks         CD-ROM  towers and libraries also utilize  CD-R and CD-E technology.      WORM drives (Write Once Read Many)      CD-R, rewriteable drives that allow data to be  erased and the disk to be reused.       Multi-function drives can provide either WORM or  rewriteable capabilities depending on the optical disk that is  used. Drives may be either one-sided or two-sided.      Disk jukeboxes are electro-magnetic devices  similar to record jukeboxes which provide ""near-line""  (as opposed to online) storage for multiple optical disks.  Jukeboxes can contain one or more optical drives. Currently,  jukeboxes can store up to 1 terabyte (1 million million bytes) of  data.      Magnetic tape and tape library formats are:             • 4 MM tape       • 8 MM tape       • DLT tape       • Tape arrays         Software alternatives are:             • Near online storage management       • Hierarchical storage management       • Archive       • Backup and restore         COLD (Computer Output to Laser Disk)  is a  microfiche replacement system. COLD systems offer economies as a  replacement medium when rapid and/or frequent access to archived  documents is necessary. Typically, a 12-inch optical disk platter  holds approximately 1.4 million 8.5-by-11-inch pages of  information, equal to 7,000 fiche masters.       COLD Benefits:                   Improve customer service response by immediately responding      to their calls rather than having to ""go look for      it."" Having multi-path access to data via account      number, name, invoice number, date, etc.         Reduce labor      costs.         Reduce COM      (Computer Output Microfilm - a system in which digital data      is converted into an image on dry processed microfilm) and      paper         Retrieval      Full Text Retrieval:                   Content-based text recognition.         Pattern matching.         Databases that      contain records of the complete text of an item, e.g., a      newspaper article, a specification, a court decision, or a      newsletter.         The capability to      search for a term (word, numeric), string of terms, or      otherwise related terms within an electronic document or a      collection of electronic documents and to retrieve documents      satisfying the search criteria.         Full text challenges:                   Few people organize information in the same way         Indexes have to be      created with the end in mind, indexing can be expensive         Misspellings in      the search text         Viewing Considerations:                   Should support OLE          Color and      monochrome support         Should be able to      view non-image files         3.5 Image Management      Image Management involves activities such as  establishing and enforcing document security, establishing  viewing rights, ensuring backups have executed successfully, and  migration strategy and storage management.      Image Security.  Users should never be  allowed to delete an image. Images can be moved by users to a  Supervisor Que or a Trash Can Que for review by a supervisor who  has the authority to physically delete the image. This process  should allow for ""sticky notes"" to be attached to the  image explaining who it needs to be deleted.      Viewing Rights.  This is permission to read  or view images (down to field level), and should be restricted to  users having the need to do so.      Backup and Recovery.  Successful backups  are absolutely critical to the success of the imaging application  for the organization. Backup procedures are designed to create  security copies of document images and their associated index  records. When carefully planned and properly implemented, backup  procedures permit the recovery of lost information and the  restoration of system operations should an adverse event occur.      Considerations:   • creation of a written tape rotation schedule including  when to rotate offsite and when to rotate older tapes out of use,   • backup hardware and software purchased must provide for a  long-term, robust, enterprise-wide solution,   • backup software must provide a verify mode which ensures  the accuracy of each backup, verify mode will increase (possibly  double) the amount of time the backup takes, but is critical to  the success,   • factor estimated growth into the backup design - the  backup, including the verify time, must complete in the allotted  timeframe or backup will begin taking up valuable production  time,   • determine if the system must be down to take a backup -  system response times will drop drastically while a backup is  running, and open folders will not be backed up,   • determine if the SQL database containing document indexes  can be incrementally backed up and restored or if a full backup  of the SQL table will be required nightly, and   • make the imaging system integrator responsible for the  successful design and implementation of an enterprise-wide  backup/restore system - factor in the above considerations.      Migration Strategy.  This is a strategy for  moving unused images off magnetic or optical disk as the disk  fills to capacity, and is critical. Some considerations are:             • Disk migration must not conflict with      the daily backup.       • Build in sufficient disk space to keep migration      requirements to a minimum - disks, such as RAID are declining      in price rapidly while their storage capacity increases      rapidly.         3.8 Conversion    Almost every application being considered for an  imaging system will have a backfile of documents, usually sitting  in a file cabinet somewhere. This backfile can range from a few  hundred documents going back a few months to several million  pages of long-term records going back 50 or more years. You must  develop a strategic plan to handle the backfile when implementing  a new imaging system. When determining whether to include the  backfile at all and how much of it to convert, consider the  following:             • retention schedule       • reference rate       • urgency of reference       • quantity of material       • operating procedures         There are at least three ways to handle backfile  conversion.             Don't convert the backfile at all;          continue with paper or microfilm as in your old system.          Start the new imaging system from first day forward. The          two systems would operate for a period of time, but          reference to the old system will lessen with time.               Convert the backfile because the old          records are active, and reference to them will continue          indefinitely. Options here include leasing scanning          equipment and hiring temporary help for the conversion.          Converting a complete backfile can be costly.               Scan on demand to convert a large,          relatively inactive backfile. No backfile documents are          scanned and indexed into the new system until they are          requested.

Executive Summary This is the plan to coordinate domestic and foreign post-earthquake investigations supported by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). The plan addresses coordination of both the NEHRP agencies--Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), and U. S. Geological Survey (USGS)--and their partners. The plan is a framework for both coordinating what is going to be done and identifying responsibilities for post-earthquake investigations. It does not specify what will be done. Coordination is addressed in various time frames ranging from hours to years after an earthquake. The plan includes measures for (1) gaining rapid and general agreement on high-priority research opportunities, and (2) conducting the data gathering and field studies in a coordinated manner. It deals with identification, collection, processing, documentation, archiving, and dissemination of the results of post-earthquake work in a timely manner and easily accessible format. For the purposes of this plan a significant domestic earthquake is defined as either (1) an earthquake resulting in a Presidential disaster declaration, or (2) an earthquake considered by NEHRP agencies to provide an opportunity to learn how to reduce future earthquake losses in the United States. The plan organizes domestic post-earthquake investigation and information dissemination activities into three phases, which include the following elements: Phase I (immediate to several days)  Incident Report and Plan Implementation--Within a few minutes after a large or potentially damaging domestic earthquake, the USGS shall notify emergency managers, NEHRP agencies, state geological survey(s) in the affected state(s), and personnel designated by the NEHRP agencies. Following this incident report, the USGS shall convene with FEMA, NIST, NSF, the state geological survey(s), and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) to determine if the earthquake is significant and warrants implementation of either all or part of the NEHRP post-earthquake coordination plan. Immediately following this consultation, the USGS in cooperation with FEMA and the state geological surveys shall alert emergency management agencies about implementation of the plan.  Web Site Management--Within hours of the event, the USGS shall establish an event Web site with links to other earthquake-related Web sites. The USGS shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to earthscience information. EERI shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to engineering information as provided by engineering centers, institutions, and private practice.  Technical Clearinghouse--Within 24 hours following mutual consultation, the USGS, FEMA, and EERI will work with state agencies to organize a field technical clearinghouse. Depending on ability and capability, the affected state(s) may take the lead in organizing the clearinghouse. California already has formalized the process for establishing a clearinghouse, with the principal NEHRP-sponsored participants being FEMA (Region IX), EERI, and the USGS. State planning currently is being conducted for the central and western United States under the aegis of the Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC) and the Western States Seismic Policy Council (WSSPC). The clearinghouse is the focal point for coordinating activities and promoting the safety of all field parties during initial post-earthquake reconnaissance.  NEHRP Investigations Coordinator--Within 24 hours of a significant earthquake, the USGS in consultation with the other NEHRP agencies shall designate a NEHRP Investigations Coordinator. The Coordinator shall be kept abreast of all NEHRP activities and relevant communications with regards to the earthquake, ensure liaison with emergency managers is adequate, and assist the NEHRP agencies to optimize the deployment of NEHRP resources and to establish priorities for investigations.  NCST Investigation--Within 48 hours, NIST will examine the relevant factors associated with building failures that occur as a result of the earthquake and will make reasonable efforts to consult with the other NEHRP agencies prior to determining whether to conduct an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act. Any NIST investigation conducted under the authority of the Act will be limited to building failures on one or more buildings or on one or more class or type of buildings selected by NIST. Phase II (several days to 1 month)  Meeting--When the initial reconnaissance phase nears completion, the NEHRP Investigations Coordinator shall  1   convene a meeting to identify opportunities and needs for rapid concentrated data gathering and investigation, including systematic collection of perishable data. Within 24 hours of the meeting, the Coordinator shall prepare a report containing summary reconnaissance findings, recommendations for collection of perishable data, and an estimate of both the level of effort and amount of funding that will be required to conduct recommended activities. On the basis of this report and pending available funds, NEHRP agencies may invite, consider, and support proposals for rapid investigations. The Coordinator shall be kept informed of all NEHRP-supported investigations in order to facilitate coordination and minimize duplication of effort.  Budget Supplemental Decision--If the earthquake presents opportunities for investigations that would improve earthquake risk mitigation, but which cannot be supported with existing funds, the NEHRP agencies shall convene within a few days after the earthquake to consider a request for a budget supplemental. Phase III (1 month to 5 years)  Workshop on Investigation Priorities--Within 1 to 2 months of the earthquake, NSF and the USGS shall jointly sponsor a multidisciplinary workshop to evaluate both short- and long-term research and development opportunities, including what intensive follow-up investigations are warranted. The workshop will identify major opportunities and recommend priorities for funding.  Investigations Solicitation--Based on the outcomes of the Workshop on Investigation Priorities and within constraints of available funding, a joint statement may be issued by FEMA, NSF, USGS, and NIST that solicits proposals for long-term research and problem-focused studies. If possible, awards are to be made within 5 months of the event.  Information Dissemination--NEHRP shall support at a minimum three types of information dissemination activities following every significant domestic earthquake. (1) An event summary report for a broad audience shall be published within 3 months of the event. The report shall integrate preliminary observations on the response of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments. It shall be prepared by the USGS and EERI in collaboration with other NEHRP supported investigators and institutions. (2) On the first anniversary of the earthquake, FEMA, NIST, NSF, and the USGS, shall support local and state agencies involved in risk reduction to hold a public conference with an accompanying proceedings that summarizes the implications of the earthquake and identifies opportunities for earthquake risk reduction. The conference and proceedings shall be targeted at local and state decisionmakers and shall be held in the region impacted by the earthquake. Participation by Federal stakeholders shall be encouraged as well.  (3) A comprehensive synthesis of research and professional reports shall be published within 5 years of the event by the USGS and NIST. Data and other detailed information shall be archived in a NEHRP virtual data center and appropriately summarized in the synthesis report. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will contribute to the publications described above to the extent possible. For foreign earthquakes, which typically are less intensively investigated than domestic earthquakes, the plan recommends that all U.S. post-earthquake investigators inform EERI of plans and schedules of investigations before departure, as well as their ongoing status once in the field. EERI shall regularly report these planned activities and their status to the NEHRP agencies as well as on its Web site. NEHRP agencies shall monitor these plans to avoid interference by visiting U.S. investigators with local experts. This proposed plan concludes with recommendations that address several deficiencies in current domestic post-earthquake investigations. The deficiencies were identified at an invitational workshop of experienced post-earthquake investigators held as part of the process to prepare this plan. Areas in need of major improvement include:  Coverage and comprehensiveness of investigations of earthquake impacts, including performance of the built and socioeconomic environments.  Application of new information technology to data collection.  Data management and archiving. The plan recommends that NEHRP develop standard formats for the collection of data on the performance of buildings and other structures in regions of severe ground shaking, including damage to nonstructural components and information characterizing the earthquake resisting properties of structures. The standard formats for data collection shall consider those already developed for existing damage prediction tools, such as HAZUS, as well as current standardized procedures for seismic design, pre-event evaluation and rehabilitation, and post-event evaluation and repair of structures. All post-earthquake data, including that accumulated by both FEMA as part of the disaster assistance process and private structural engineering firms, should be both collected digitally and stored in a virtual Web-based archive. This new database could be maintained either by the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) or at various sites from where data would be retrievable from a single or mirrored Internet site using time stamps and a georeferencing system. The database would be addressable using all of the tools of a modern geographic information system as well as using modern relational database technology on the Internet. NEHRP also should involve a wider range of disciplines, including economics, sociology, and political science, in post-earthquake investigations. Protocols for data collection in these disciplines also should be standardized.  2   Because much of this information helps to reduce future losses, it is important that adequate funding be available for domestic post-earthquake investigations. For example, domestic post-earthquake investigations for each significant earthquake could be funded by establishing a separate fund during the next NEHRP reauthorization that could then be drawn upon for Federally-declared earthquake disasters; such funds could be administered by FEMA. Another possibility could be to designate and utilize existing agency programs to fund these activities. However, in the absence of such funds, all of the NEHRP agencies shall be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Such a template could also be used for post-event investigations of other types of disasters, including natural and terrorist events, which would allow for the documentation of information that would help improve the protection of the Nation's infrastructure from future events.   Documenting societal and economic impacts and providing information for improving earthquake response and recovery activities.  Identifying specific opportunities to mitigate the impacts of future earthquakes. In summary, benefits from post-earthquake investigations can include improved emergency response, a safer built environment, cost-effective construction of new structures and rehabilitation of older ones, improved land-use practices, and better understanding of earthquake hazards in the United States. This plan provides a framework for both coordinating what is going to be done and identifying responsibility for post-earthquake activities. It does not and cannot specify what will be done because each earthquake offers different challenges and learning opportunities. The plan applies primarily to the NEHRP Federal agencies and their partners, which range from state agencies, multi-state consortia, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI), the NSF-funded centers and organizations for earth science and earthquake engineering research and education, the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), to other academic and professional groups with professional interests in post-earthquake investigations. It is important to recognize that NEHRP post-earthquake activities primarily consist of information gathering and documentation of what happened. Some of this information, however, is of immediate interest to emergency managers and the public. NEHRP agencies and partners need to convey this information in a timely manner. The primary responsibility is to alert the public and Federal and state agencies about the occurrence and scope of the event. However, NEHRP investigators must be prepared to convey other aspects that bear on public safety or concerns. In addition to proposing a structure to improve coordination of the activities and investigations that typically are conducted following significant earthquakes, the plan also identifies new activities--some of which are permitted by advances in technology--that are considered significant to improve loss reduction in future earthquakes. These activities and a mechanism for their funding are described in four recommendations. Their implementation would substantially improve the contribution of NEHRP post-earthquake investigations to earthquake risk reduction in the United States. Earthquakes are one of several hazards that can cause large disasters that result in great loss of life and property. The most significant of these are hurricanes, floods, winter storms, tornadoes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and terrorism. Indeed, from 1992 to 1996, losses in the U.S. from natural hazards averaged about $1 billion per week (OSTP, 1997). Post-event documentation of these hazards and their consequences contributes significantly to improvements in mitigating their impact and thereby reduces future losses. Although scientific and technical aspects of these hazards may differ, post-disaster investigations pose many similar challenges. Thus, this plan for post-earthquake coordination should be useful for planning and coordinating investigations of these other hazards.  2. Purpose This report presents the plan to coordinate domestic and foreign post-earthquake investigations supported by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). As has been demonstrated in numerous disasters, authoritative and timely scientific and engineering advice after a disaster both improves emergency response and helps allay public fears and anxiety. Large urban earthquakes in the United States can cause many fatalities and great property loss. It is likely after a great earthquake that the Nation will turn to officials of NEHRP for authoritative advice following these inevitable events. By coordinating its post-earthquake response, NEHRP will be in a stronger position to provide input and work effectively with officials involved in the post-earthquake emergency response activities. Major earthquakes also provide critical information on earthquake processes, ground shaking, and the performance of the built and socioeconomic environments. A set of coordinated efforts during and following the event can enhance the information acquired. The nature and quality of this information can significantly reduce losses not only immediately following the specific event, but also from future events through improved planning, design, and construction. The infrequency of large damaging earthquakes and the many NEHRP-supported investigators who can be expected to conduct field studies after earthquakes require that post-event investigations be closely coordinated in order to maximize the learning that will improve mitigation of the effects of future earthquakes. Postearthquake investigations are critical for:  Providing insight into why and how faults rupture.  Understanding and predicting shaking and secondary ground deformation.  Documenting and improving performance of the built environment.  Evaluating the adequacy of current building standards and practices.  3   3. Background The 2001-2005 NEHRP Strategic Plan (FEMA, in press) stresses the importance of post-earthquake investigations. NEHRP has long supported post-earthquake investigations including efforts in the earth sciences, engineering, and socioeconomic disciplines. Improved coordination is necessary if these investigations are to maximize learning through the sharing of information. Because the USGS has the statutory responsibility and authority under Public Law 101-614 to conduct post-earthquake investigations, the Strategic Plan tasks NEHRP under the leadership of the USGS to (1) examine the roles and responsibilities of the various groups involved in post-earthquake investigations and (2) develop a NEHRP protocol action plan as well as a funding mechanism for investigations following major domestic and foreign earthquakes. According to the Strategic Plan, the NEHRP protocol action plan should detail the degree of coordinated learning desired, how those findings will be obtained, and how findings can be most effectively disseminated to all stakeholders in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary NEHRP report. The objectives of the present plan are to improve coordination during post-earthquake investigation efforts, minimize duplication of efforts, identify activities that could be supported with additional resources (such as disaster funds from FEMA or supplemental appropriations), and maximize the opportunity to learn from both domestic and foreign earthquakes. To develop the NEHRP protocol action plan, the USGS requested the assistance of the Applied Technology Council (ATC) of Redwood City, California, under USGS cooperative agreement 1434-WR-97-AG-00015, ATC-35. ATC organized a multidisciplinary 7-member committee to draft the plan and a multi-institutional oversight committee to review the plan. Input was solicited from experienced post-earthquake investigators and NEHRP agencies at an invitational workshop held March 13-14, 2001, in Menlo Park, California. The workshop was jointly sponsored with EERI. Based on input from the workshop, a draft plan was prepared. In addition to the review by the oversight committee, comments were solicited from the general post-earthquake investigation community on a draft posted on the ATC Web site. The present plan is the result of this manifold input and comment process.  occurring in the United States and abroad are treated separately. Domestic earthquakes provide NEHRP with its best opportunity to evaluate seismic hazards and the performance of the built and socioeconomic environments in the United States. Furthermore, NEHRP is directed to conduct investigations of domestic events by the 1977 Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act. Consequently, domestic earthquakes typically receive greater scrutiny by NEHRP than do foreign earthquakes. Foreign earthquakes, however, usually provide insight into crustal failure processes, seismic radiation fields, and some construction practices that contribute to earthquake risk mitigation in the United States, as well as opportunities for model validation. For example, about $1.5 million in NEHRP funds was used to support U.S. research investigations of the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, and Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquakes. In some cases, such as the 1988 Spitak, Armenia, and the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquakes, the affected countries request specific technical assistance from the U.S. Government, and these requests are usually fulfilled by NEHRP agencies. 4.1 Domestic Earthquakes The proposed plan to coordinate post-earthquake investigations for significant domestic earthquakes is shown schematically in figure 1. For the purpose of implementing the plan, either in part or in total, a significant domestic earthquake will be defined as follows: (1) an earthquake resulting in a Presidential disaster declaration or (2) an earthquake considered by NEHRP agencies to provide an opportunity to learn how to reduce future earthquake losses in the United States. The plan identifies the steps and approximate timeline necessary to achieve coordination goals, as well as the parties responsible for each activity. The responsible parties include NEHRP agencies, entities funded either in part or totally by NEHRP, and other entities with whom NEHRP should coordinate. As shown in the figure, these activities are parts of a continuum. Initial or Phase I post-earthquake activities focus on defining the scope of the disaster and are reconnaissance in nature. They quickly assess the character and distribution of inflicted damage and generated ground effects, identify research opportunities that will improve the practice of earthquake risk mitigation, set the stage for subsequent in-depth data gathering, and aid emergency managers by identifying hazardous situations that may be exacerbated by aftershocks or other processes. These Phase I activities are typically followed by more intensive data gathering for subsequent research and analysis. This period is commonly referred to as Phase II and may last for weeks after the event. Phase III is the longer period after the earthquake when comprehensive research and investigations are conducted. Most of the activities identified in the plan are currently conducted by NEHRP following domestic earthquakes. The plan is designed to place them into a more formal structure. Some of the activities, particularly those that apply new information technology, are evolving with each earthquake. For these activities, the plan tries to anticipate their evolution and assign responsibility for their implementation.  4. NEHRP Post-Earthquake Coordination Plan The plan addresses coordination during three time frames or phases after the earthquake:  Phase I--Post-earthquake reconnaissance during the first few days.  Phase II--Intensive gathering and archiving of perishable data during the first few weeks.  Phase III--Research and investigations, including additional data gathering and archiving, conducted during the subsequent months and years. The response of NEHRP to domestic and foreign earthquakes is sufficiently different in scope that earthquakes  4   Figure 1. Activities timeline for NEHRP Post-Earthquake Coordination Plan--Domestic earthquakes.  4.1.1 Phase I Following the USGS incident report and decision by the NEHRP agencies to activate the plan, several decisions must be made promptly by NEHRP. These decisions occur almost simultaneously. They include: (1) activation of an event web site, (2) establishment of a field technical clearinghouse, and (3) designation of an Investigations Coordinator.  4.1.1.1 Incident Report and Plan Implementation (USGS) When a large or potentially damaging earthquake occurs in the United States, the USGS shall determine and announce the magnitude and location of the earthquake within minutes. Once announced, emergency response personnel are alerted through the National Warning System (NAWAS), which is operated by FEMA. As development of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) progresses, the USGS capability to estimate the strength and geographic distribution of strong shaking will also improve. The USGS has the mandate to quickly provide information on the strength and distribution of strong ground shaking to emergency managers and others. The improved ANSS system is greatly improving the capability of USGS to fulfill this mandate. Each NEHRP agency shall identify (and review annually) a contact who shall be alerted directly by the USGS about the event. Each NEHRP agency also should develop a list and strategy for contacting entities that have partnership responsibilities in the area of post-earthquake investigation. Examples of such entities include EERI, state geological surveys and regional associations, earth science centers, and NSF-funded centers for earthquake engineering research and education.  These entities should request that the USGS provide automatic e-mail alerts, which can be received on cell phones, pagers, and computers. Following the incident report, the USGS shall convene a conference call with the NEHRP agencies, the state geological survey(s) in the affected state(s), and EERI to determine if the earthquake is significant. If the earthquake is deemed significant, the USGS in consultation with the preceding agencies and organizations shall decide whether to implement all or part of the NEHRP post-earthquake coordination plan. If the decision is made to implement the plan, the USGS in collaboration with the state geological surveys shall inform emergency management agencies of the implementation.  4.1.1.2 Web Site Management (USGS) Under the plan, the USGS shall be responsible for establishing, within a few hours of a significant earthquake, an event Web site with links to other Federal and non-Federal earthquake-related Web sites. The USGS has recently automated this process for any domestic earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 or greater and foreign earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or greater; smaller events may still be significant, however, and regional earthquake information centers will need to adopt and modify the automatic posting criteria to best meet the needs of their region. Beginning with the devastating earthquake in 1995 in Kobe, Japan, the Internet has become an important source of information about earthquake disasters for both technical personnel and the public. To facilitate searches for the event Web site, its URL and a link shall be posted on the USGS Earthquake Program Web site (http://earthquake.usgs.gov) and the EERI Web site (http:  5   //www.eeri.org). The event Web site shall include brief descriptions of linked sites so that earth scientists, engineers, and social scientists will be able to search efficiently for information about the earthquake. Entities that are funded by NEHRP agencies and that establish Web sites shall be instructed by their funding agencies to inform the USGS of their URL and provide the USGS with a brief description or abstract of the Web site. The USGS event Web site also shall include information about the location of and activities at the technical clearinghouse (see 4.1.1.3). The Web site shall include authoritative sources of information; the USGS, EERI, and FEMA have responsibility, respectively, for earth science, engineering, and Federal disaster information and assistance. The USGS shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to earth-science information. EERI shall have principal responsibility for collating and linking to engineering information as provided by the engineering centers, institutions, and private practice. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program along with the USGS regional and National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) Web sites will be critically important sources of basic information for the news media and general public in the first few hours following a damaging earthquake. Commonly the demand for information surges several orders of magnitude during this period. In the past, the USGS has had difficulty in meeting this surge in demand; accordingly the USGS has recently contracted with a private vendor for web content distribution. It is important that the USGS continue to employ a web-content distribution strategy that is scaleable and designed to perform well during peak periods. This will ensure that the  media, the general public, and responding officials, all have information about what is happening as soon as it is available.  4.1.1.3 Technical Clearinghouse (USGS, FEMA, EERI) Within 1 day after a significant earthquake, a place should be established in the region affected by the earthquake where post-earthquake field investigators can meet to review progress and to organize and coordinate their activities. For very large events, multiple places might be appropriate. Such a field facility, known as a technical clearinghouse, is increasingly becoming part of the post-earthquake investigation culture in the United States (fig. 2). For purposes of coordination and safety, it is strongly recommended that all field investigators, regardless of affiliation, go through the clearinghouse before conducting field investigations. Formal clearinghouses were established after the 1994 Northridge, California, and 2001 Nisqually, Washington, earthquakes. Establishment of the technical clearinghouse is paramount to ensure an orderly post-earthquake technical reconnaissance that does not interfere with emergency response activities. To meet this goal, direct communication between the clearinghouse and state and Federal Disaster Coordinating Officers needs to be established and maintained. California has formalized the process for establishing a clearinghouse, with the principal NEHRP-sponsored participants being FEMA (Region IX), EERI, and the USGS (OES, 1998). Recently, the Western States Seismic Policy Council (WSSPC) and Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC) have sponsored efforts to formalize the clearinghouse process  Figure 2. Investigators meet at technical clearinghouse to discuss findings from field investigation of 2001 Nisqually, Washington, earthquake (photograph by Charles Scawthorn).  6   in their regions. WSSPC recently both adopted a policy that ""each state, province, and territory establish a plan for postearthquake clearinghouses to be activated within 24 hours after each major earthquake..."" (WSSPC, 2001) and published a model plan (http://www.wsspc.org/publicpolicy/committees/ clearinghouseplan.pdf). CUSEC, which coordinates earthquakerelated efforts of geological surveys in the central United States, is developing a regional plan that will identify a single point of contact following an event. The USGS, FEMA, and EERI shall work together on behalf of NEHRP and develop a general procedure for establishing a clearinghouse within 24 hours following a significant earthquake. The procedure shall be formulated in collaboration with state emergency management, state geological surveys, and appropriate multi-state consortia. The degree of leadership or responsibility by NEHRP entities for a specific event will depend on the level of involvement of non-Federal agencies in the clearinghouse. In cases where the states have a clearinghouse plan and resources, a state may take the lead in establishing the clearinghouse, with NEHRP and its affiliated agencies being partners in that effort. In other cases where states are not prepared to establish a clearinghouse, NEHRP shall take the lead in establishing the clearinghouse, with participation as available from state and local agencies. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will coordinate with the clearinghouse to the extent possible. Both the specific design and operation of the clearinghouse are the responsibility of the participants, but general operational plans must be prepared in advance by the USGS, FEMA, and EERI, if a fully functional clearinghouse is to be quickly established. With regards to NEHRP-supported investigations, EERI shall take responsibility for the engineering and socioeconomic aspects of the operation, and the USGS shall take responsibility for the earth science aspects. It is crucial that NEHRP funding agencies encourage funded centers, groups, and individuals to coordinate their activities with either EERI or the USGS through the clearinghouse. It is especially important that academic investigators, students, and technical representatives of the earthquake engineering research and education centers [Mid-America Earthquake Center (MAE), Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER), and Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER)] and earthquake earth science centers and organizations [Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), and the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO)] contribute and participate in the coordination efforts. These centers and organizations comprise a valuable assembly of multidisciplinary expertise in earthquake investigations. In addition, students from these centers can gain first-hand experience and provide valuable support to the technical clearinghouse. USGS shall formalize agreements with the major NEHRP-affiliated earth science centers and organizations to facilitate coordination; EERI shall formalize agreements with the major NEHRP-affiliated engineering centers and professional groups, such as the Technical Council  on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering (TCLEE), that routinely investigate earthquakes. It is critically important that these centers and organizations develop plans for post-earthquake investigations and share them with EERI and the USGS. Finally, at the time of an event, participation of faculty and students from universities and colleges, who are not affiliated with either earthquake engineering or earth science centers and organizations, will be welcomed. Both the operational relation and physical proximity of the technical clearinghouse to the Disaster Field Office (DFO) need to be considered when the clearinghouse is established. Some information collected during the Phase I activity may be relevant to decisions being made at the DFO. Coordination of the clearinghouse with the DFO may also provide a basis for a state's request that the clearinghouse be given a mission assignment by the appropriate state emergency services agency and thereby qualify the clearinghouse for partial funding support from disaster relief funds authorized by the 1974 Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, et seq.). If the earthquake is substantial and receives prominent coverage by the news media, many foreign researchers can be anticipated to visit. The USGS, EERI, and state agencies shall arrange at the clearinghouse to welcome, orient, and possibly brief these visitors about potential sites for their inspection and study as well as safety concerns. Close coordination between U.S. and foreign efforts can augment U.S. expertise and provide assistance with NEHRP post-earthquake investigations. Information directing visiting scientists and engineers to the clearinghouse should be posted on the event Web site.  4.1.1.4 NEHRP Investigations Coordinator (USGS) Within 1 day of a significant earthquake, a NEHRP Investigations Coordinator shall be designated by the USGS. The USGS shall maintain a list of suitable candidates, both in and out of the Federal service, and ensure that a mechanism is available to retain the full-time services of each individual on short notice for a minimum of 1 month. Preparation of the list and selection of the Coordinator shall be done in consultation with FEMA, NSF, and NIST. The Coordinator shall be an individual with broad technical background, previous post-earthquake investigation experience, and a thorough awareness of the capabilities of the various NEHRP agencies and their affiliated centers and organizations. The primary responsibilities of the Coordinator are (1) to ensure that disaster response activities are not impeded by scientific and technical investigations, (2) to provide emergency managers with timely and relevant information from the ongoing field investigations, (3) to facilitate coordination of NEHRP agencies, (4) to ensure that NEHRP press releases are coordinated and consistent, and (5) to work with scientific and engineering leaders to identify critical investigations and gaps in the ongoing investigation. Because it is impossible to delegate authority to the Investigations Coordinator under NEHRP, program managers in each NEHRP agency must work closely and cooperatively with the Coordinator to take advantage of the broad perspective of the Coordinator.  7   The advent of the Internet has greatly facilitated timely communication and reporting during natural disasters. Most organizations involved in post-earthquake investigations routinely provide daily situation reports on findings, progress, and difficulties encountered. Most of these reports are issued as e-mail. The Coordinator shall be (1) informed by each NEHRP agency about the scope of their post-earthquake investigation and (2) copied on all e-mail reports from supervisory field personnel and planning staff when possible. The Investigations Coordinator must also be kept abreast of activities at the technical clearinghouse. In summary responsibilities of the Investigations Coordinator are to:  Ensure that liaison with the Federal and State Coordinating Officials (FCO and SCO) and state and local emergency managers is established promptly. The purposes of the liaison activity are to ensure that NEHRP field efforts do not impede emergency response and recovery management and that relevant scientific and technical assessments from the field investigators are appropriately communicated to emergency managers. In addition to the scientific and technical assessments, some physical resources may be useful for emergency response. For example, it may be of value to make emergency managers aware of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory portable real-time aftershock warning system that can be shipped on short notice to an impacted area1. If a state has already established a liaison person for scientific and technical investigations, the Coordinator should work with the designated state liaison person.  Identify duplication and gaps in initial field reconnaissance and work with NEHRP program managers and state agencies to improve coordination and rectify shortcomings.  Work with NEHRP and state agencies and Federal, state, and local emergency managers to ensure that news releases are consistent and helpful to the public.  Convene and report results from Phase II meeting (see 4.1.2.1).  Congress anticipated the Act to be applicable to building failures caused by earthquakes. In section 2(c)(1)(J) of the Act, it specifies that the NIST Director develop implementing procedures that ""provide for coordination with Federal, State, and local entities that may sponsor research on investigations of building failures, including research conducted under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977."" In addition, Committee Report 107-530, published by the House Science Committee on June 25, 2002, states that ""The Director should clearly define how earthquake researchers and Teams will carry out their responsibilities in a coordinated fashion in cases where building failures have been caused by an earthquake."" The purpose of the Act is to (1) establish the likely technical cause or causes of the building failure, (2) evaluate the technical aspects of evacuation and emergency response failures, (3) recommend as necessary specific improvements to building standards, codes and practices, and (4) recommend any research and other appropriate actions needed to improve the structural safety of buildings and improve evacuation and emergency response procedures, based on the findings of the investigations. The Act requires that NIST issue a public report no later than 90 days after completing an investigation. Within 48 hours, NIST will examine the relevant factors associated with building failures that occur as a result of the earthquake and will make reasonable efforts to consult with the other NEHRP agencies prior to determining whether to conduct an investigation under the Act. Any NIST investigation conducted under the authority of the Act will be limited to building failures on one or more buildings or on one or more class or type of buildings selected by NIST. 4.1.2 Phase II  4.1.2.1 Phase II Meeting (NEHRP Investigations Coordinator) When initial reconnaissance activities have been completed and initial assessments of earthquake effects and damage have been made, typically within a few days to a week, it will be the responsibility of the Investigations Coordinator to convene a meeting to identify opportunities and needs for further investigation and concentrated data gathering. This meeting should involve leaders of the field efforts and include representatives from the USGS, FEMA, NIST, NSF, EERI, earthquake engineering research and education centers, earth science centers, IRIS, UNAVCO, state agencies, multi-state consortia, and groups representing the earth science, engineering, and social sciences communities. The meeting is referred to in figure 1 as the Phase II meeting. The primary purpose of the meeting is to identify important or unique geologic and seismologic effects, damage to the built environment, and societal impacts for which concentrated short-term investigations and data gathering are required to ensure that important information is collected before it is lost or obliterated. It is particularly important to identify opportunities to collect important perishable data, such as data on structural and lifeline performance, aftershocks, and ground failure, including fault rupture and secondary deformation. These are investigations  4.1.1.5 National Construction Safety Team Act (NIST) Prompted by the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001, Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team Act, which was signed into law on October 1, 2002. The Act authorizes the Director of NIST to establish and deploy a Team to investigate the failure of a building or buildings that has resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential for substantial loss of life. To the maximum extent practicable, the Director shall establish and deploy a Team within 48 hours after such an event.  1 The aftershock warning system consists of a base station and 8 remote stations. A self-contained broadcasting system sends signals to pagers within 60 miles of the base station. The pagers provide as much as a few seconds warning of potentially hazardous shear-wave arrivals from aftershocks. The pager signals can be used as switches for either automatic response or to emit noise and flashing light.  8   that must be conducted quickly before effects and damage are obliterated by recovery efforts and natural processes. In retrospect, important data have been lost following past earthquakes that could have been used to develop better engineering criteria and other hazard mitigation tools. As a consequence, valuable lessons were not learned and many needed tools to reduce losses and casualties have not been developed. Within 24 hours after the meeting, the Investigations Coordinator shall prepare a brief summary of the meeting for the NEHRP agencies that describes (1) major preliminary findings of the reconnaissance teams and (2) opportunities for further investigations identified by participants in the meeting. The summary shall consider hazard mitigation and risk management priorities in applicable local and state hazard mitigations plans while identifying investigation priorities. The report shall include an estimate of the level of additional support required to pursue these opportunities. On the basis of this report of the Investigations Coordinator, NSF, the USGS, EERI, the earthquake engineering research and education centers, and earth science centers shall work jointly to optimize the collection of perishable data. If recommendation 4 (see 5.4) to seek additional funds to increase the level of post-earthquake support is successful (or if supplemental funds are appropriated), it is recommended that a statement, which is jointly prepared by FEMA, USGS, NSF, and NIST, of opportunity for directed data collection be posted on the USGS and EERI event Web sites and the NSF Web site soliciting statements of qualifications and funding requests from groups or organizations willing to conduct data gathering. This statement of opportunity should specifically identify urgent investigations and note that funding decisions will be made quickly by the process described in recommendation 4. Data gathering teams responding to this statement of opportunity will typically include professors and students, representatives from both the earthquake engineering research and education and earth science centers, representatives of state and Federal agencies, personnel from professional organizations, and groups from engineering and other private firms. If recommendation 4 is not successful (or if supplemental funds are not appropriated), the report should be used to take maximum advantage of available NEHRP and other resources. These resources include those of (1) NSF, which may supplement existing research contracts and award both new peer-reviewed grants and Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER), (2) USGS, which redirects agency personnel and their research funding, (3) FEMA, whose engineering studies support recovery as specified under the Stafford Act, (4) NIST, which has the authority to conduct building investigations, and (5) the earthquake engineering and earth science centers, which provide support from discretionary funds. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will use its available resources for the conduct of its investigation. In addition, the NSF award to EERI to support the Learning from Earthquakes Program now includes funding for a few small grants for post-earthquake data collection. Because these resources are collectively modest and typically do not pro-  vide for comprehensive documentation of earthquake damage and effects, it is imperative that they be directed towards investigations of highest priority. This will require that these institutions work together before making awards. To improve the utility of data gathered during Phase II, NEHRP needs to standardize formats for data gathering and archiving. This is the purpose of recommendations 1, 2, and 3 (see 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3). We strongly encourage the NEHRP agencies to begin developing these standards and a process for electronically archiving these data before NEHRP is confronted by the next significant earthquake. While the success of recommendation 4 would provide funding that could support implementation of this activity, planning must be completed before the next earthquake.  4.1.2.2 Budget Supplemental Decision (FEMA, NIST, NSF, USGS) If the earthquake presents opportunities for investigations that would improve earthquake risk mitigation, but which cannot be supported with existing funds, the NEHRP agencies shall convene and consider a request for a budget supplement within a few days after the earthquake. The meeting shall be convened when field reports are adequate to make strategic decisions about these opportunities. This meeting will be unnecessary if the potential permanent funding sources have been established (see 5.4). 4.1.3 Phase III  4.1.3.1 Workshop for Setting Investigation Priorities (NSF, USGS, FEMA, NIST) Establishing priorities for long-term investigations, development, and implementation strategies following significant earthquakes is an important challenge for NEHRP. Large damaging earthquakes typically provide many opportunities to improve the understanding of earthquakes and their impacts. The NEHRP agencies (NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA) and appropriate state agencies and multi-state consortia shall jointly sponsor a workshop of earth scientists, engineers, and social scientists within 1 to 2 months of significant earthquakes to discuss priorities for long-term (Phase III) research and development opportunities presented by the earthquake. The workshop shall consider priority initiatives in applicable local and state hazard mitigation plans when evaluating investigation priorities. The format adopted in the EERI workshops following recent foreign earthquakes is a possible model that might be supported by NEHRP. These EERI 2-day workshops have served effectively to identify the most promising research opportunities--those that have the greatest potential to improve the current state of knowledge and practice throughout the world's seismic zones. The results of the NEHRP workshop will be presented immediately afterwards in a report that identifies major needs and opportunities for investigation, with a recommended set of priorities for funding. Within the constraints of available funding, a joint statement shall be issued soliciting long-term research and inves-  9   tigations. Funding shall be made within approximately 5 months of the event. The internal post-earthquake research activities of the USGS, FEMA, and NIST shall be coordinated with externally supported research of the NEHRP funding agencies.  4.1.3.2 Information Dissemination (USGS, NIST, NSF, FEMA) The publication and dissemination of findings from NEHRP post-earthquake investigations currently are both inconsistent and incomplete. Research findings are published in a wide variety of journals in a more or less timely manner, but official publications of the participating organizations often are not available until years after the event. This significantly reduces their potential impact on both earthquake-related knowledge and loss-reduction policy. This plan envisions that three different types of publications will be issued either under the aegis of or with facilitation by NEHRP for every significant domestic earthquake (these are not meant to preclude publication of institutional reports like those currently prepared after significant earthquakes):  Three-Month Event Summary--An event summary for a broad audience shall be published within 3 months of a significant earthquake. The summary should be well illustrated, comprehensive, and integrate preliminary observations on the seismological processes controlling the event and the response of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments. It is recommended that the event summary be prepared under the leadership of the USGS and EERI with formal collaboration of FEMA, NIST, and other NSFfunded entities. For example, the contributions of all of the major engineering and earth science investigative efforts supported under NEHRP should be integrated and incorporated. The USGS and EERI should designate editors within 1 week of the event, but co-editors from contributing agencies and centers should be included to facilitate agency participation. The summary is intended as a multidisciplinary document covering the earth sciences, engineering, and social sciences. It is not intended to substitute for institutional reports such as the EERI reconnaissance report, the USGS circular, and center reports that currently are produced following significant earthquakes.  One-Year Conference Proceedings--Because of the opportunity to implement change in the aftermath of disasters, FEMA, NIST, NSF, and the USGS will encourage and support local and state agencies in sponsoring a public conference with a proceedings on the 1-year anniversary of a significant earthquake. The conference should identify and synthesize the policy implications of the event for earthquake risk reduction. NEHRP agencies shall participate and provide support to the state agencies as needed to promote a successful conference. The conference and proceedings would be analogous (but without the legal implications) to transportation disaster assessments by agencies, like the National Transportation Safety Board, that investigate transportation accidents to determine causality. Another model is the 1995 Earthquake Information Exchange Workshop,  which was held following the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. The anniversary conference should be held in the region impacted by the earthquake and the content of the conference should be designed to target an audience of local and state policymakers in addition to Federal stakeholders. It is also expected that NEHRP will sponsor technical conferences, as is the current practice.  Comprehensive Synthesis (3 to 5 Years)--A comprehensive report that consists of one or more volumes that synthesize the results and findings from studies carried out by the research and professional practice communities shall be published within 3 to 5 years of the event by the USGS and NIST, with assistance from NSF and FEMA. The cost of this publication shall be shared among the NEHRP agencies. The report shall emphasize the significant contributions of the post-earthquake investigations to the knowledge base on earthquakes and earthquake loss reduction and bring relevant data together in a summary fashion. The report shall be coordinated with the data archive discussed later (see 5.3) where detailed investigations of representative structures, including plans, design criteria, estimated force distributions, and displaced shapes could be presented. The report should contain overviews of important findings derived from research on earth sciences and on the built and socioeconomic environments. This synthesis should include an extensive bibliography of the post-earthquake publications and should focus both on damage and disruption and on situations where the built environment performed well and little or no damage occurred. A comprehensive Phase III synthesis is important for several purposes to researchers and practitioners, including providing both rapid entry into the literature on the earthquake and overviews of studies that have been conducted in different disciplinary areas. A synthesis also distills significant lessons learned for future research, practice, and loss-reduction policy. Finally, NEHRP shall publicize the report to both the research and practice communities. If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will contribute to the publications described above to the extent possible. 4.2 Foreign Earthquakes NEHRP supports investigations of foreign earthquakes because they often provide special opportunities to validate models and to learn about both the performance of specific aspects of the built environment and the geologic and seismologic processes that will have implications for earthquake risk mitigation in the United States. Cost and logistics generally limit the size of NEHRP foreign postearthquake investigations. Federal agencies generally do not participate unless officially invited by the impacted country. These factors cause tremendous differences in the character of individual investigations. At one extreme, investigations are modest and limited to small EERI reconnaissance teams, as for example, with the 1992 Erzincan,  10   Figure 3. Activities timeline for EERI post-earthquake activities--Foreign earthquakes.  Turkey, earthquake. At the other end of the spectrum, affected foreign governments request U.S. assistance and these investigations have foreign policy implications, as with the 1988 Armenia, USSR, 1995 Kobe, Japan2, and 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquakes. In the latter situation, some of the investigating teams are representatives of the U.S. Government while others, who are not covered by the request, are independent. Failure to coordinate schedules of field teams may lead to interference with the work of local experts and is the principal operational issue for NEHRP-supported foreign deployments. U.S. institutions typically respond independently in the earth sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Field parties supported by the EERI Learning from Earthquakes Program, the three earthquake engineering research and education centers (MAE, MCEER, and PEER), SCEC, CERI, IRIS, UNAVCO, as well as individuals with small NSF grants for exploratory research (SGER) may all visit earthquake-damaged areas with Federal funding support. In addition, the USGS, NIST, private firms from both the U.S. and foreign countries, and research entities from foreign countries commonly deploy field teams. The uncoordinated deployment of U.S. citizens has prompted complaints by affected countries to the U.S. Department of State. In its recent award to EERI for the Learning from Earthquakes Program, the Civil and Mechanical Systems directorate of NSF requested that EERI coordinate investigators funded by that directorate. In investigations in Turkey in 1999 and India in 2001, EERI has increasingly served as a point of contact for foreign post-earthquake 2 In this case, the Japanese request for U.S. Government assistance was delayed for more than a month following the event.  investigations. This plan recommends that NEHRP expand this EERI role. This plan recommends that each NEHRP agency request all of its post-earthquake investigators to inform EERI of plans and schedules of their investigations before departure as well as their ongoing status once they are in the field. EERI shall report these planned activities and their status regularly to the NEHRP agencies and post this information on its Web site. Because authority to influence schedules rests with the NEHRP funding agencies, the agencies shall review proposed plans for their potential impact on the proposed country. Although it is beyond the scope of the NSF mandate to EERI, this plan encourages EERI to keep local technical and scientific personnel abreast of U.S. activities, to involve them in these activities where possible, and encourage them to communicate relevant findings directly to the government of the country affected by the disaster. These communications from local personnel may be useful for reconstruction as well as encourage mitigation of future losses. It is noted that EERI in its Learning From Earthquakes Proposal to NSF has strengthened the coordination role of the EERI Team Leader and group leaders for each of the disciplines. In the field they solicit cooperation with other investigators. In preparing the preliminary and final EERI reports, they solicit and coordinate contributions from others who participated in field investigations. The EERI Team Leader also plays a significant role in helping to coordinate the second phase of data collection by making contact with each of the investigative teams before they enter the field and maintaining contact with them during field investigations by e-mail and phone. The EERI Team Leader offers to direct these investigators to areas that require further investigation before perishable data are lost. The approach allows researchers to collect data in several  11   waves, improving the comprehensiveness of the documentation of earthquake impacts. Coordinating field investigations and drawing on contributions from other teams ensures a clear understanding of damage and impacts, less duplication, less disruption of local emergency response and research efforts, more effective utilization of limited research funding, and a more comprehensive report on the earthquake. The EERI post-earthquake investigation plan is shown in figure 3.  compiled. Documentation of the seismic performance of nonstructural components in facilities is particularly lacking. This failure to document fully the physical impacts of an earthquake has serious consequences because full-scale testing of the performance of engineered systems under dynamic loading is often impractical. Because damaging earthquakes are infrequent, each failure to systematically document damage is a lost opportunity to improve:  Performance-based design.  Loss estimation.  Safety assessments of badly damaged structures. The current trend in earthquake engineering is to base seismic risk evaluations and design decisions on the predicted behavior of structures and their components during assumed levels of earthquake ground shaking. This approach, called performance based earthquake engineering, shows great promise as a framework to enhance the ability of both the private and public sectors to identify and to quantify levels of risk, to develop cost-effective strategies for risk reduction activities, and to implement efficient seismic rehabilitation. Yet these techniques rely completely on assumptions on the part of engineers of the actual performance of the built environment. An overly optimistic view can overlook significant risks or lead to ineffective designs. In the other extreme, excessive conservatism leads to unnecessarily high costs or, worse yet, inaction in the face of a seemingly insurmountable problem. Effective decisions on the part of building owners and managers, insurance and financial institutions, and public policymakers require realistic predictions of expected behavior in a statistical context. Extensive documentation of actual behavior, good and bad, of a broad range of structures subjected to real earthquakes will provide the data to meet this critical need. These data that document performance of the built environment are also essential for improving earthquake loss estimation models. Predictions of earthquake impacts with computer-based loss estimation models are becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors because the rarity of large damaging earthquakes does not permit robust actuarial estimates of future losses. Comprehensive documentation of the impacts of future earthquakes will improve model-based estimates of structural and nonstructural damage, casualties, and financial loss. Documentation of the performance of the socioeconomic environment also is very incomplete. Increasingly post-earthquake investigations include social, organizational, and economic issues, but much more progress is needed. For example, despite their obvious importance, relatively little emphasis is currently being placed on the systematic collection of data on earthquake-related deaths and injuries, both for U.S. and foreign earthquakes. The same can be said for other topics of major societal relevance such as the short- and longterm social and economic impacts of earthquakes, including impacts on regional economies, communities, households, and businesses. Because of its importance, the organization  5. Recommendations for Further Action At the March 13-14, 2001, invitational workshop held to provide input for this draft plan, participants identified several aspects of NEHRP post-earthquake investigations that are deficient. These deficiencies diminish the potential contribution of NEHRP to risk reduction in the United States. Aspects in need of improvement include the following:  Comprehensiveness--Investigations of earthquake impacts do not comprehensively cover all aspects of the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments.  Efficiency--Emerging new information and technologies can greatly increase the quality and quantity of data collection, while lowering costs.  Data storage and retrieval--Much of the data that has been collected in past earthquakes has been effectively lost. If data collection is to become even more comprehensive, data management, archiving, and linking to existing data must be improved. The following recommendations propose solutions to these interrelated deficiencies. The objectives of the first 3 recommendations are to improve the scope (Recommendation 1), the quality and quantity (Recommendation 2), and the utility (Recommendation 3) of data acquired during post-earthquake investigations. Recommendation 4 proposes mechanisms for funding these improvements. 5.1 Recommendation 1--Broaden Coverage and Comprehensiveness of Investigations of Earthquake Impacts  Issue--Impacts on built and socioeconomic environments are not well documented Research on the impacts of earthquakes on the natural environment (for example, seismology, ground motion, and permanent ground deformation) is relatively well organized and documented by NEHRP because the USGS has both budgetary and operational responsibility in this area. The result has been significant improvement by both USGS and non-USGS scientists in the basic understanding of the natural consequences of earthquakes, such as shaking and permanent ground deformation. In contrast, performance data on the built environment (for example, buildings and lifelines) are not systematically  12   and effectiveness of emergency response and relief activities should be routinely documented.  Potential Solutions Built Environment Two aspects of structural performance surveys are particularly important--(1) adequate inventories of the building stock and others structures at risk and (2) systematic documentation and compilation of both damaged and undamaged structures. The lack of adequate data inventories hampers assessment of the significance of observed damage in many cases. Inventories make it possible to characterize the damage data and place it in proper context. For example, the knowledge that 1,000 steel buildings in the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, suffered significant damage is incomplete information and fails to answer questions such as ""How many steel buildings were subject to strong ground shaking?"" or ""Where were the damaged buildings located relative to the fault?"" Fortunately, with the increasing application of standardized procedures for (1) seismic design of structures, (2) preevent evaluation and rehabilitation of structures [see FEMA 310 (ASCE,1998a) and 356 (ASCE, 1998b)], (3) post-event evaluation and repair of structures [FEMA 306/307/308 (ATC, 1998a,b,c)], and (4) damage prediction [FEMA 154 (ATC, 1988), HAZUS (HAZUS, 1999)], a framework is emerging in the United States for both the collection of performance data and the development of inventories. For example, HAZUS, which was developed by FEMA to standardize loss estimates from earthquakes and other natural hazards, provides a framework for inventories of facilities and the description of performance. This plan recommends that NEHRP adopt a format for documenting performance that is consistent with these methodologies. It also recommends that NEHRP through FEMA also promote the development of robust inventories of structures by working with HAZUS users groups and others who have adopted and adapted these procedures. Important work in these areas is already ongoing at the NSF-funded earthquake engineering and research and education centers. This plan recommends that the systematic documentation and compilation of damaged and nondamaged structural performance, as well as the documentation of earthquake resisting properties of structures, be spearheaded by FEMA and NIST, because the data also would ultimately be used to improve building codes and standards and practices for structures and lifelines. The format for this documentation shall be established by FEMA and NIST before the next earthquake and could be similar to the ATC-38 post-earthquake building performance assessment form (ATC, 2000) and the EERI clearinghouse report form (S. McAfee, written commun., 2001; EERI, 1996). The actual surveys could be conducted by a contract with engineering organizations, such as American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), National Council of Structural Engineers Association (NCSEA), and ATC under the supervision of FEMA and NIST. In the absence of the success of Recommendation 4 for supplemental funding, it is unclear how the postearthquake damage surveys will be funded.  The extensive and detailed information on the damage to facilities that is routinely compiled by FEMA as a part of the disaster assistance funding process and by private structural engineering and design firms are existing valuable sources of information that are not currently available for research purposes. Coordination with FEMA and private firms to capture these data would provide a large source of additional data3. Once the collection of data on the built environment is improved, the data must be appropriately archived and made available. This can be accomplished by promotion of a NEHRP database (see Recommendation 3). Socioeconomic Environment A wider range of disciplines and specialists also needs to be incorporated into post-earthquake reconnaissance activities. Although there has been movement in the direction of greater disciplinary diversity, post-earthquake reconnaissance activities are undertaken primarily by earth scientists and engineers. Groups that remain underrepresented in post-earthquake investigations include public health specialists (such as epidemiologists), researchers from the various social science disciplines (for example, economics, sociology, geography, and political science), and experts from the emergency management and public policy communities. Mechanisms must be established to encourage greater participation by investigators with expertise in the social science and public health fields, experts in economic modeling, and others who can contribute to the collection and analysis of data on the pre- and post-impact social environment. NEHRP should coordinate and work with organizations involved in studying the socioeconomic and public health aspects of disasters to recruit and train a cadre of qualified health and social science investigators who can participate in future post-earthquake studies. A partial list of these organizations include the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of California at Los Angeles Center for Public Health and Disasters, leading social science centers such as the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado and hazardfocused geographic information system (GIS) laboratories such as the Hazards Research Lab at the University of South Carolina, and professional associations such as the International Research Committee on Disasters. As an initial step, EERI should initiate outreach efforts aimed at informing social science and public health researchers about NEHRPrelated post-earthquake data collection opportunities and more effectively integrate members of these groups into postearthquake investigations. EERI should also seek input from social scientists on how to improve the quantity and quality of data that are collected on the societal aspects of earthquakes. As is the case with other disciplines involved in post-earthquake investigations, new protocols are needed to ensure that the data-collection strategies and instruments that are used to 3 Previous studies have emphasized the need for systematic collection and compilation of economic impacts (see NRC, 1999).  13   obtain data on the social, economic, and health impacts of earthquakes are standardized, so that comparisons can be made across time and across earthquake events. Existing documents such as the EERI Post-earthquake Investigation Field Guide outline in broad terms the types of social and economic impact data that should be obtained during the post-earthquake reconnaissance phase. This guide should be reviewed, revised, and expanded to incorporate a broader range of social science data as well as to provide more systematic frameworks for recording those data. When revised, the guide should be distributed widely within the social science research community. Agencies that sponsor post-earthquake investigations should also recognize that gaps in knowledge exist because many disciplines and topics lack adequate funding. In making funding decisions, NEHRP agencies should examine how to ensure better disciplinary coverage so that significant research topics--including those focusing on the socioeconomic environment--are not overlooked. Both the Investigations Coordinator and the entities responsible for organizing the Phase II and III meetings to set priorities shall be responsible for ensuring that significant socioeconomic issues are included in the research plans that are developed and that adequate funding is available to support that work. Finally, societal impact data must be placed in a larger context. For example, this could be done through the systematic collection of data on both pre- and post-event characteristics of affected communities, populations, and economies. 5.2 Recommendation 2--Encourage Use of Information Technology  spread of post-earthquake fires and spills of hazardous materials.  Data on earthquake casualties and on other social and economic impacts.  Potential Solution Advances in information technologies now permit rapid, cost-effective collection and analysis of virtually exhaustive data sets in each of the above categories. A few examples of current, but only recently available technologies include the following:  PDA-GPS-digital camera technology to permit standardized but rapid and extensive digital descriptions of georeferenced damage data for regional and detailed structure and lifeline damage studies.  Remote sensing (for example, InSAR, LIDAR) for compilation of inventories of the visible built environment before and immediately after the main event, for regional assessments of damage.  Digital recording and near-real-time dissemination of strong shaking measurements throughout the affected built environment during the occurrence of damage from the main earthquake to provide the quantitative recordings needed for emergency response, performance-based engineering, and the rebuilding of a safer society.  High-resolution low-altitude vertical and oblique aerial photographs as a mandatory part of the NEHRP post-earthquake reconnaissance, to be made available free on the Internet.  On-site digital video image capture by special imagecapture vans with mounted digital cameras to document building status on both sides of a street immediately following the event.  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data for understanding of the real-time impacts and response to earthquakes of distributed systems such as gas, water, and wastewater systems. SCADA systems have emerged as a typical feature of lifeline networks over the last several decades--the data are generally available but have been little used for studying the effects of earthquakes, damage and post-earthquake response, and demands on distributed systems. It should also be mentioned that while not observational data, both ShakeMap and HAZUS results can be valuable adjuncts to post-earthquake investigations (in addition to emergency response). Existing GIS inventories of the built environment can guide comprehensive inspection and data collection for essential facilities and infrastructure. These are only a few examples of relatively new technologies that can be used more effectively in post-earthquake investigations. IT is developing so rapidly that new tools and applications are emerging constantly. In order to enhance post-earthquake investigations and analyses, this plan recommends that NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA support ongoing research into applications of IT and ways to analyze and use  Issue--Information Technology (IT) offers opportunities to improve collection of data Data that are amenable to collection using remote sensing, digital imaging, global positioning system, and other new and emerging technologies are distributed widely within the natural, built, and social environments. A wide variety of data, which previously could not be collected or only collected at great effort, can now be collected and analyzed rapidly, often in near-real time. Examples include the following:  Regional geodetic and geological effects.  Recordings of strong shaking on the ground and in engineered structures during the main shock.  Aftershocks.  Ground deformations associated with faulting, liquefaction, landslides, and shaking.  Direct and indirect damage to structures and lifelines (both in a regional statistical sense and in detailed studies of selected structures).  System responses, such as pressures and flows in gas, water, and wastewater systems, telephone demand surges, and traffic patterns.  Collateral dynamic phenomena, such as growth and  14   the collected data. The NSF-funded earth science organizations and earthquake engineering research and education centers provide excellent resources for this effort. We also recommend that, in the immediate response to the event, NSF, USGS, NIST, and FEMA support equipment and other resource needs and facilitate access to and use of selected IT assets that may be beyond the resources of individual investigators (for example, if FEMA tasks national reconnaissance assets to fly over a domestic earthquake the imagery should be available to NEHRP-supported investigations to the maximum extent feasible). If NIST is conducting an investigation under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, NIST will support this solution to the extent possible. 5.3 Recommendation 3--Formalize Data Management and Archiving  retrievable from a single or mirrored Internet site using time stamps and a geocoded referencing system. NEED would be addressable with all of the tools of a modern GIS, as well as with modern relational database technology on the Internet. Researchers could contribute to it from any location, according to established quality control guidelines. NEED will fill the need for a permanent, interactively managed national and international archive for the unprecedented data sets to be collected from future damaging earthquakes. One approach to this effort would be to require each recipient of NEHRP funding (NSF grantee, the earthquake centers, USGS awardees, NIST, and others) to budget a percentage of the grant funds (for example, 1 or 2 per cent) for archiving raw and reduced data in NEED. Alternatives for management and maintenance of NEED include: (1) Integration into and management by the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). (2) Residency in the National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE), and with oversight by a board consisting of representatives of organizations such as MCEER, PEER, MAE, EERI, Seismological Society of America (SSA), ATC, and Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE). NEED could reside on the NISEE server with mirror servers on the MAE, MCEER, and PEER servers. (3) Residency in the NSF Digital Library for Earth Science Education (DLESE). The costs associated with implementing this solution range from research funding focused specifically on the integration of new technologies into post-earthquake investigations to providing funds for a workshop where investigators share information on their data collection and archiving strategies and to supporting a Web site where data-sharing will be accomplished. Each level of effort has an associated cost. Once the data repository format has been established, implementation of a consensus-based repository can be accomplished. Dedicated costs for creation and maintenance of NEED would be perhaps two staff-years to start, and one staff-year annually thereafter, with hardware and expenses perhaps in the tens of thousands of dollars annually. Contribution of data into NEED would be a distributed cost, borne by each contributing investigation. This plan recommends that all NEHRP-supported investigations be required to budget a small fraction of the investigation's overall costs for this purpose. 5.4 Recommendation 4--Funding to Support Post-Earthquake Investigations  Issue--Collected data are not well archived and therefore are effectively lost It is critical to develop strategies for the formal and systematic archiving of data collected during post-earthquake investigations. These data, which focus on the natural, built, and socioeconomic environments, address a wide variety of phenomena. The data are voluminous and are acquired in many forms (for example, digital recordings, digital images, clipboard survey sheets, photographs, and narratives). If not organized and archived soon after an earthquake event, these data are often lost. No mechanism currently exists either to archive these data or to make them readily accessible to the research community. Because of this failure to adequately document, preserve, and access data, an enormous volume of highly relevant data has been effectively lost.  Potential Solution Management of these data requires:  Research on cost-effective field data collection--Much of the initial data from post-earthquake investigations are collected on foot in the field. Use of georeferenced personal digital assistants and digital and video cameras with GPS capability and other efficient data collection tools should be encouraged by the development and free dissemination of standardized software applications and associated data protocols for use both in the field and for downloading data.  Development of a consensus-based repository for collected data--Rather than relying on physical repositories, technology now permits most data to be digitally recorded and stored. Therefore, this plan recommends the creation of a virtual web-based archive, analogous to the structure and functioning of the Consortium of StrongMotion Observation Systems (COSMOS) Virtual Data Center (http://db.cosmos-eq.org/). This new database, to be called the ""National Earthquake Experience Database"" (NEED) should be maintained at individual centers, but  Issue--Funding of post-earthquake investigations is inadequate The absence of readily available financial resources to fund immediate, short-term, and long-term post-earthquake investigations has resulted in the failure to collect valuable  15   data vital for development of earthquake disaster reduction measures and has handicapped substantial follow-up research investigations. For the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake, Congress enacted ""Emergency Supplemental Funds"" for use by the NEHRP agencies for post-earthquake investigations. The emergency supplemental funding provided by Congress following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was $20 million, of which $8 million was designated for post-earthquake investigations administered by USGS. The emergency supplemental funding provided by Congress following the 1994 Northridge earthquake was $13 million. It was recognized that this is neither the best nor the most efficient means to fund these efforts 4. The report to Congress by FEMA (1993), which was requested in the 1990 reauthorization bill, provides an excellent summary of the benefits of post-earthquake investigations and suggests several alternative approaches to establishing a fund for this purpose. It was clear that the four principal NEHRP agencies could not agree on a single best approach.  Potential Solution One possible solution for funding domestic post-earthquake investigations to be used when an earthquake has been designated as a Presidentially declared disaster could be obtained by establishing a separate fund during the next NEHRP reauthorization that could then be drawn upon for Federally-declared earthquake disasters; such funds could be administered by FEMA. Another possibility could be to designate and utilize existing agency programs to fund these activities. However, in the absence of such funds, all of the NEHRP agencies shall be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Such a template could be used as well for post-event investigations of other types of disasters, including natural and terrorist events, which would allow for the documentation of information that would help improve the protection of the Nation's infrastructure from future events. Foreign post-earthquake investigations could continue to be funded on a basis of need from each of the NEHRP agencies. Background--The issue of funding of post-earthquake investigations is a very significant one and received considerable attention at the March 2001 workshop and subsequently by the authors. One alternative that was explored but ultimately not included in the recommendations was the possibility of utilizing the Stafford Act to provide funds for post-disaster investigations. The amount of funds could be equal to 1 percent times the Section 406 disaster relief funds5. For the Loma Prieta earthquake this would have amounted to about $28 million, and for the Northridge earthquake it would have totaled about $60 million. The funds made available by such change in the Stafford Act 4 Public Law 101-614, National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Reauthorization Act, Section 11 (b), November 1990. 5 For comparison, Section 404 currently provides between 15 and 20 percent times the 406 expenditures for hazard mitigation grants. For the Northridge earthquake this amounted to about $722 million.  could also be used to provide post-disaster funds for disaster related investigations following other natural events such as hurricanes and, even more significantly, man-made events such as acts of terrorism. However, this alternative was not included in the report's recommendations because any proposed new language modifying the Stafford Act would require action by Congress, which is unlikely at the present time. Because the funding of post-earthquake investigations remains a crucial issue, this plan recommends that all NEHRP agencies be prepared to submit a request through FEMA to Congress for appropriate emergency supplemental funding following a significant domestic earthquake. Recommended Administration--With any of the funding mechanisms discussed above, this plan recommends that FEMA, as lead NEHRP agency, be responsible for the identification of investigation topics, distribution of the funds, and reporting of the results to Congress6. For earthquake disasters, it is recommended that the NEHRP Policy Coordinating Group, Presidentially appointed individuals from the four principal NEHRP agencies, create a standing nine-member post-earthquake investigation Selection Committee to assist FEMA in fulfilling these responsibilities. This Selection Committee shall be mobilized within days after a significant earthquake, attend all briefings, participate in the joint NSF/USGS/FEMA/NIST priority-setting workshop, and be responsible for identifying the basic and problem-focused investigation efforts required to maximize learning from the specific earthquake disaster. On the basis of the outcomes and recommendations of the workshop, the Selection Committee shall recommend to FEMA topical areas and funding levels for each area. FEMA would determine the funds to be allocated to each NEHRP agency. Each NEHRP agency shall be responsible for the identification of appropriate projects and investigators, administration of its grants, project supervision, and be accountable for funds allocated to their agency in their topical areas. They will actively contribute to the report to Congress. The nine members of the Selection Committee shall consist of one member from each of the four principal NEHRP agencies and at least four members from the non-Federal earthquake community.  6. Annual Review of Plan The United States historically has been fortunate that large damaging urban earthquakes have been infrequent. This is due more to the relatively recent formation of the United States as a nation than to a lack of seismicity. Potentially damaging earthquakes, such as the 1811-12 New Madrid sequence in the Midwest, the 1755 Cape Anne, Massachusetts, and 1886 Charleston, South Carolina, events on the east coast, the 1857 Fort Tejon event in southern CaliforFEMA currently reports to Congress on hazard-mitigation grant projects funded by Stafford Act Section 404 even though these projects are selected by the state for which the disaster has been declared and approved by FEMA before expenditure. 6  16   nia, and the 1700 mega-event in the Pacific Northwest, are all well documented, but occurred before major urban or suburban development of the regions. In modern times, the only large (M>7) earthquakes that affected U.S. cities were the 1906 San Francisco, California, and 1964 Good Friday, Alaska, earthquakes, both of which devastated cities. Smaller (M<7) but more frequent modern events, however, such as the 1971 San Fernando, 1989 Loma Prieta, 1994 Northridge, and 2001 Nisqually earthquakes, offer opportunities to learn how to reduce earthquake risk--the ultimate goal of NEHRP. Thus, opportunities to implement this proposed plan in its entirety will only happen irregularly. As normal turnover in NEHRP management occurs, however, new managers may be unfamiliar with the plan. Implementation of the plan is further complicated by NEHRP's lack of a line-management structure to activate this plan immediately after an event. Therefore, it is recommended that the NEHRP Interagency Coordinating Committee (ICC) review this plan annually, and after each review remind agency and institutional managers of their obligations under the plan. The annual review should also include an opportunity for comments from the professional and research community involved in earthquake risk mitigation. It is recommended that this annual review occur on the anniversary of the largest recorded earthquake in U.S. history, the March 27, 1964, Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. The annual review would provide opportunities to revise or modify the plan as appropriate. A fundamental tenet of emergency management is that the process and currency of planning are as important as the plan itself.

I am pleased to join you at this opening session of the 26th Annual Water Reactor Safety Meeting.  Given the agenda discussion topics, I believe this will be a very informative meeting, and I encourage each of you to contribute your insights and ideas to the dialogue.  To begin the dialogue this morning, I would like to discuss with you a significant transition taking place at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-the move toward ""risk-informed regulation""-and, in particular, the role of research in achieving this goal.      I believe that the acquisition of valid risk information, and the prudent use of that information in decision-making related to nuclear safety matters, are achievements essential to the continued effectiveness of the NRC and the industries it licenses and regulates.  For this reason, I have made the theme of risk-informed regulation central to my tenure as the NRC Chairman.   In fact, the Commission is committed to the goal of using risk information and risk analysis as part of a policy framework that applies to all phases of our nuclear regulatory oversight, including rulemaking, licensing, inspection, assessment, and enforcement.      Just as a sound policy framework clearly is the key to making prudent decisions, a vigorous, focused safety research program is fundamental to achieving a robust foundation for risk-informed regulation.  Therefore, in my remarks today, I want to answer a series of questions that will place into context the role of research in risk-informed regulation: (1) Why is it so important that the NRC make the transition to risk-informed regulation?  (2) Why is research key to the transition?  (3) What has been accomplished to date-both by the NRC and by the nuclear industry?  (4) What are our areas of current focus?  and (5) What initiatives are being planned for the future?      I.  Why Is It So Important for the NRC To Make the Transition To Risk-Informed Regulation?      Before answering this question directly, let me set the stage with a brief acknowledgment of  the more far-reaching and global changes that are facing the nuclear power industry and the NRC today.  The deregulation of the electricity generation market to allow and to encourage competition is expected to lead to new ownership arrangements, and to an increased focus on the control and reduction of facility operating costs.  Faced with this changing environment, nuclear power licensees must decide whether to complete the existing terms of their licensed nuclear plant operations, to decommission early, or to apply for a 20-year renewal of their operating licenses.  Some already have chosen to decommission prior to the end of the license term.  Two licensees, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and Duke Power, have submitted applications for license renewal-for Calvert Cliffs and Oconee, respectively.  For those licensees who choose to continue operation under either the current or a renewed license, the reduction of operating costs clearly will be a primary objective.  Licensee efforts to eliminate unnecessary burdens or to achieve greater flexibility will, in many cases, involve interactions with and oversight decisions by the NRC.  But these decisions will not be easy to make.  As you all are aware, nuclear technology is very complex, not only from the standpoint of the complexity and diversity of plant design features, but also in terms of operational factors such as the human-machine interface, aging effects, and potential accident sequences.  The challenge of deciding how, and when, it is appropriate to reduce design margins, to enhance flexibility, and to relieve unnecessary regulatory burden without allowing an undue risk to public health and safety is a significant one.        Given this background, the importance of the NRC transition to risk-informed decision-making in regulatory matters quickly becomes evident.  Essentially all Commission and NRC staff decisions can be made more effectively, if they can be based on valid information about the risk importance of the decision.  For each rulemaking, regulatory guide, or generic letter we issue, the Commission conducts a regulatory analysis to weigh the costs associated with the action against the risk reduction and safety enhancement  to be achieved.  For nuclear power reactors, the Commission also has adopted the backfit rule which requires that, with the exception of cases involving compliance or adequate protection, the proposed action must provide substantial additional protection before it will be taken.  In a number of instances, a significant volume of risk information and risk analysis has been developed to support these decisions.  However, in other cases, we have had only  qualitative  information available about the risk reduction potential of a rule change, whereas quite specific  quantitative  information has been available concerning the potential costs.  Clearly, the quality of our decisions on generic regulatory matters will improve as the breadth, scope and generic applicability of available risk information improves.      In addition to decisions on generic issues, each year we make numerous plant-specific decisions-on the appropriateness of a particular license modification, on what aspects of a given facility or licensed activity should be inspected, or, in a given case, on whether a civil penalty should be issued for a violation of NRC requirements.  Once again, it is obvious that these plant-specific judgments will better ensure the protection of public health and safety if we can base them on a solid foundation of plant-specific or site-specific risk information.      The Commission has formally documented its position on the importance of using valid risk information in its deliberations and actions.  In our Principles of Good Regulation, we state that ""Regulatory activities should be consistent with the degree of risk reduction they achieve.""  Under the principle of ""Reliability,"" we further state that, ""Regulations should be based on the best available knowledge from research and operational experience.  Systems interactions, technological uncertainties, and the diversity of licensees and regulatory activities must all be taken into account so that risks are maintained at an acceptably low level.""  In the 1995 Commission Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Policy Statement, to which I will refer again later in these remarks, we also note that PRA and associated analyses should be used ""to reduce unnecessary conservatism associated with current regulatory requirements, regulatory guides, license commitments, and staff practices.""  These quotes summarize the general principles of the Commission regarding the use of risk information and risk analysis-that we should use these insights to increase our safety focus, to achieve appropriate risk reduction, and to eliminate  unnecessary  conservatism and any associated  unnecessary  burden on our licensees or the NRC staff.        When applied broadly, as a coherent approach to the full spectrum of regulatory activities, risk-informed regulation will allow us to maintain a clear sense of the primary NRC health and safety mission, while also being responsive and flexible in the face of change.  When such an approach is  not  in place--even when a clear sense of mission exists--the organizational response to emerging issues can become a patch-work of quick fixes, knee-jerk reactions, and/or redundant programs that quickly balloon into overall inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and a lack of clear priorities.  A risk-informed approach provides a structured, systematic, and defensible method that can be applied not only to rulemaking, but also to licensing, inspection, enforcement, and performance assessment--as well as providing a basis for prioritization in the establishment of programs and the allocation of resources.      2.   Why Is Research a Key To This Transition?      Let me next provide my perspective on why research is such an important attribute in the pursuit of more risk-informed regulatory decision-making.  Information from research programs can aid such decision-making in several ways: (1) by providing new information, (in the form of test results or detailed analysis), that sheds light on the likelihood, consequences, or mode of progression of a given accident; (2) by relating that risk information and analysis to the specific context of a rule, regulatory guide, or generic letter-even when that information leads to the closure of an issue or concern without new requirements; and (3) by providing a risk-informed context relevant to a plant-specific licensing, inspection, or enforcement action.      These enhancements to decision-making can occur in the NRC oversight of either reactor or materials licensees, and can take place independently of whether a formal PRA or partial PRA has been developed for the facility in question.  However, when coupled with PRA  information or folded into a PRA, research on system or human performance or on accident phenomena can be even more helpful in providing a directly relevant basis for regulatory decision-making.  Additionally, research can advance the state-of-the-art of PRA, by reducing or quantifying uncertainties in risk estimates, allowing new phenomena to be incorporated into risk estimates, addressing previously unmodeled operating modes, or providing greater design detail for inclusion in a given risk model.       These aspects emphasize the role that research has played and will continue to play in this vital NRC transition to risk-informed regulation.  Clearly, a great deal of work remains to make this transition complete and successful.  However, before discussing the new initiatives we need to undertake to accomplish our goals, we should recognize what already has been accomplished and consider the efforts that currently are underway.      3.   What Has Been Accomplished To Date-Both By the NRC and By the Nuclear Industry?        Clearly, one of the earliest milestones in advancing our understanding of nuclear safety risk was the publication of the WASH-1400 study, in 1975.  WASH-1400 provided risk estimates for two plants-a Westinghouse-designed pressurized water reactor (PWR), and a General Electric-designed boiling water reactor (BWR).    Although there were criticisms of WASH-1400 that limited its application in regulatory decision-making, it did represent a significant advance by demonstrating the potential benefit that a more fully developed PRA could have as a regulatory tool.      As time progressed, the NRC and the nuclear power industry continued to conduct risk studies, and PRA methods and insights gradually began to be seen as having direct application to regulatory activities, as a valuable complement to deterministic engineering approaches.  In other words, the application of PRA has represented an extension and enhancement of traditional regulation, rather than a separate, different, stand-alone technology.  PRA methods were used effectively during the anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) and station blackout rulemakings, and were incorporated into the generic issue prioritization and resolution process.  Probabilistic analyses also were used in developing an approach to estimate the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for a reactor site, as part of the rule change to reactor siting criteria in 10 CFR Part 100.       In 1986, the Commission took a key action toward incorporating risk information and risk analysis into an overall framework for decision-making, by publishing the NRC ""Policy Statement on Safety Goals for the Operation of Nuclear Power Plants.""  These Commission Safety Goals set forth quantitative societal health effects objectives, based on the incremental risk of cancer arising from potential accidents at nuclear power plants.  The Commission recognized that such goals could be implemented best through the continued maturation of PRA as the mechanism for performing quantitative safety assessments.      In early 1991, the NRC published NUREG-1150, ""Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants,"" after extensive peer review.  In NUREG-1150, the NRC used improved PRA techniques to assess the risk associated with five nuclear power plants, including the WASH-1400 plants and adding an additional BWR and two PWRs, to examine a range of containment designs.  This study was a significant turning point in the use of risk-informed concepts in the regulatory process, and enabled the Commission to improve greatly its methods for assessing containment performance and accident progression after core damage initiators.  The methods developed for these studies, and the results that emerged, provided a valuable foundation in quantitative risk techniques.      With the increasing sophistication of PRA techniques, the NRC began to use PRA information in assessing the safety importance of operating reactor events, as well as making risk analysis an integral part of the design certification review process for advanced reactor designs.  Some reactor licensees also began using risk-assessment methods to identify plant vulnerabilities-and with the initiation of the Individual Plant Examination (IPE) program and the Individual Plant Examination External Events (IPEEE) program, all reactor licensees began participating in this effort.  I should note that all power reactor licensees have completed the IPE program, and to a large measure already have undertaken the plant changes judged to be appropriate based on a weighing of risk reduction versus cost.  I also would point out that we are nearing the completion of IPEEEs by all licensees, which, with the resultant plant design and operational changes, will represent another significant milestone in risk-informed regulation.      Since the publication of NUREG-1150 and the continued work of the nuclear industry to enlarge and improve the PRA database, the Commission has continued to develop policies and guidelines on the use of PRA insights.  In 1995 the Commission published a major revision of the NRC Regulatory Analysis Guidelines (NUREG/BR-0058, Revision 2).  The Regulatory Analysis Guidelines included a formulation of screening criteria for using PRA information, in conjunction with the subsidiary safety goals, as part of regulatory decision-making on generic matters such as rulemaking and generic letter issuance.  The guidelines relate the subsidiary safety goals to the criterion of substantial additional protection contained in the NRC Backfit Rule, 10 CFR 50.109.  They also lay out criteria for the quality of the risk information needed for such safety goal evaluations.      Perhaps even more significantly, the Commission also published in 1995 the PRA Policy Statement, from which I quoted earlier, setting out the broad principles and goals that the Commission would pursue in the PRA Implementation Plan.  With the publication of the PRA Policy Statement, the Commission consciously began to take a more holistic approach toward risk-informed regulation, with the goal of establishing an overall framework for risk-informed decisions in all regulatory functions, as well as on plant-specific licensing issues.  The NRC PRA Implementation Plan was established to describe and monitor progress on Commission initiatives, including (1) the development of additional regulatory guidance on risk-informed plant-specific licensing decisions; (2) the incorporation of risk information and analysis into NRC rulemaking, inspection, licensing, and enforcement programs; and (3) the linkage between NRC and industry activities in this area.      Just this past July, the Commission published Regulatory Guide 1.174, ""An Approach for Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Risk-Informed Decisions on Plant-Specific Changes to the Licensing Bases.""  Whereas the Regulatory Analysis Guidelines provide a framework for generic decision-making  initiated  by the NRC, this Regulatory Guide provides a general  framework for plant-specific NRC decisions that have been  requested  and  initiated  by licensees.  It sets forth the Commission-approved principles for NRC staff evaluation of such proposals, including expectations for application of the Commission Safety Goal Policy, reliance on traditional defense-in-depth approaches, and maintenance of sufficient safety margins when initiating changes to the licensing bases.  In addition, it provides criteria for the scope, level of detail, and quality of the PRA supporting the licensee submittal.      The publication of Regulatory Guide 1.174, while critical, was only a partial step toward the overall use of PRA information for plant-specific decisions.  Regulatory guides and standard review plans also have been published that outline risk-informed approaches for in-service testing programs, technical specifications, and graded quality assurance programs.  In addition, the staff has provided, for trial use, a regulatory guide on risk-informed in-service inspection.       The nuclear power industry has initiated pilot projects at several reactors that are expected to provide a basis for refining these risk-informed regulatory guides.  These pilot applications have included proposed licensing changes such as (1) changes to allowable equipment outage times; (2) changes to equipment testing intervals; (3) changes to the types, locations, and frequency of piping inspections; and (4) reduced quality assurance measures on specified equipment.  I will acknowledge that during the development of the PRA regulatory guides, there was insufficient  acceleration of plant-specific pilot requests for changes to plant licensing bases.  This has changed, especially since the guides now are complete (although still subject to revisions based on actual use).  In addition to the pilots, the Nuclear Energy Institute is sponsoring a whole plant study to support the development of changes to 10 CFR Part 50.  A significant effort also is underway to develop an industry consensus standard for conducting a PRA, coordinated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).  Groups such as the Electric Power Research Institute have contributed greatly to these and other ongoing risk studies.  The NRC staff is committed to working with the nuclear power industry to ensure that these efforts achieve the desired advances in risk-informed regulation.      I would like to point out that not all NRC regulatory activities lend themselves as readily to the use of risk analysis event trees and fault trees, found so useful for commercial power reactors.  Although the NRC has developed probabilistic methods for performance assessment of waste disposal facilities and decommissioning, we are still evaluating approaches for applying risk analysis methods to medical and industrial uses of radioactive material.  While our focus at this meeting is on water reactor safety, it is important to note that the NRC staff also has developed a plan for moving forward on risk-informed regulatory oversight of our materials licensees, and to the degree that resources permit, we intend to implement that plan.      4.   What Are Our Areas of Current Focus, Relevant to Risk-Informed Regulation?        Clearly, many of the specific initiatives I have described so far are areas of ongoing activity, in which we have made significant progress but which will continue to evolve and mature.  Most of these initiatives have related directly toward risk-informing NRC requirements-either through a risk-informed approach to rulemaking or through guidance on making risk-informed changes to the plant-specific licensing bases.  In recent months, however, the Commission has accelerated the transition toward risk-informing NRC  processes -that is, establishing a framework for NRC inspection, performance assessment, and enforcement that will more readily accommodate and incorporate risk information and risk analysis.  These changes, for the most part, are still works-in-progress; however, the NRC staff has been working intensively in these areas, actively soliciting and receiving input from our stakeholders, and I would like to share briefly with you the general direction of the progress we have made.      Over the past three years, the Commission has placed increasing emphasis on risk-informing these processes.  The 1996 Commission-directed Arthur Andersen study of the Senior Management Meeting process resulted in an increased emphasis on using objective, quantitative information as input to the assessment of reactor licensee performance.  In addition to developing more objective performance indicators, the Commission directed a more systematic processing and comparison of regulatory performance data in the areas of human performance, enforcement, allegations, and risk.  Inspection procedures and the NRC Enforcement Policy were revised to require the explicit consideration of risk information as part of evaluating the significance of problems identified.  Senior reactor analysts, trained as PRA experts, were placed in each of the regions and in NRC Headquarters.  Reactor inspectors were provided additional training on PRA and PRA applications.  Taken together, these efforts helped to lay the groundwork for the increased incorporation of risk information and risk analysis into our reactor regulatory oversight processes.      Current efforts, however, are re-examining our inspection, assessment, and enforcement processes in much more fundamental, comprehensive terms.  For example, the NRC staff has sought to answer the question: What is the ""risk-informed baseline"" level of inspection for reactor licensees?  In other words, what is the baseline amount of inspection that the NRC must conduct-even at the best performing reactor sites, in order to have the requisite degree of confidence that licensee safety performance is being maintained?      The first step in answering this question, in keeping with the overall NRC mission of protecting public health and safety, has been to identify the ""Cornerstones of Safety""-those fundamental objectives that characterize safe and appropriate reactor licensee performance and plant material condition.  When considering light-water reactor safety, these cornerstones basically reduce to the following: (1) minimizing plant transients; (2) preventing accidents; and (3) being able to mitigate accidents, should they occur.  Once these cornerstones have been established, we then can proceed (1) to define the inspectable population of facility equipment and activities; (2) to determine monitoring methods that will provide the desired level of confidence that no undue risk is presented by facility operation; and (3) within such a context, to establish and execute an inspection program that can be adapted as necessary to the characteristics and performance of specific licensees.      The NRC staff has been working with industry representatives and other stakeholders to determine how this sort of risk-informed program could be established most effectively.  At a recent public workshop, members of the NRC staff worked with industry representatives to define these cornerstones of reactor safety, as well as to discuss how radiation safety and safeguards objectives could be integrated into such a program.  In particular, the workshop focused on how a risk-informed NRC reactor performance assessment process could take its input from a combination of objective performance indicators, NRC inspection results, licensee reports, and other data sources.  The NRC staff also has been working with our stakeholders to determine the appropriate role of enforcement as an integrated part of an overall risk-informed regulatory oversight framework.      Based on our current schedule, the NRC staff intends to brief the Commission next week on these proposed improvements-and in particular the proposed changes to the reactor assessment process.  While the Commission has not yet determined the appropriateness of these changes or the exact features of the processes that will result, we have made clear our commitment toward achieving an overall framework for reactor oversight that is coherent, scrutable, defensible, and risk-informed. This will allow the NRC to apply  necessary  burden, but not  unnecessary  burden.  Based on the continuing efforts by the NRC staff and the industry, we believe that we are making rapid progress toward that goal.      5.  What Initiatives Are Being Planned for the Future?      So far I have described how WASH-1400, NUREG-1150, and industry efforts have provided a substantial body of risk information, how various Commission policies and guidance documents have established a framework for incorporating this information into regulatory decision-making, how we are seeking to reform our reactor oversight processes to be more risk-informed, and, in fact, how a number of risk-informed regulatory decisions have been made.  Given the progress that we have made, should we be content with continuing to use existing tools-that is, continuing to rely on the current state-of-the-art in PRA methods?        In my opinion, the answer to that question is ""no.""  Too many issues and decisions still face the NRC and the nuclear power industry that could benefit from advances in the state-of-the-art of PRA capability.  A vigorous research program must be retained in order to achieve these advances.  Consider some examples:            Our ability to understand the risk effects of component and structural aging at nuclear power plants and other facilities will become increasingly important as facilities age, and as we assess the capability of licensees to manage those aging effects.               Continued efforts to model the effects of human performance and reliability on risk would help to narrow the uncertainties persisting in this area.               Licensees are continuing to replace analog circuitry with digital technology, including software, in the safety and control systems of power plants.  Although we have in place some deterministic acceptance criteria for such replacements, we would benefit from the ability to quantify more accurately the reliability of these new systems through the use of probabilistic methods.               Some stakeholders have expressed an interest in reducing the burden or providing greater flexibility in NRC fire protection and quality assurance requirements.  The ability of the NRC to determine how to proceed would be facilitated by a better understanding of the risk significance of the various facets of these programs.       The NRC Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research has developed plans to advance our capability to analyze all these issues, using PRA methods.  If the Congress provides sufficient funding, we intend to pursue those plans.      In addition to these initiatives, the NRC research program will continue to provide the technical bases, including improved calculational tools and data, to support more realistic analyses of safety margins in thermal hydraulics, fuel behavior, reactor physics, engineering, and materials.  These efforts will lead to more accurate risk estimates, elimination of unnecessary conservatism, and improved decision-making.      We also are considering several new initiatives.  The Commission is considering the issuance of a white paper on ""Risk-Informed, Performance-Based Regulation"" to facilitate a common understanding among our stakeholders of such key terms as ""risk-informed,"" ""risk-based,"" and ""performance-based"" regulation.  Given that the NRC has been criticized for not having a real definition of safety, as we move to risk-informed, performance-based regulation, a common understanding of fundamental terms is of paramount importance.  The NRC staff also is reviewing the possible benefits of a revision to the existing Safety Goal Policy, to add a quantitative safety goal for core damage frequency.  We are considering, both internally and in joint efforts with the nuclear power industry, how we could make our reactor regulations in 10 CFR Part 50 more risk-informed, with particular emphasis on developing a more risk-informed 10 CFR 50.59 process.  Throughout all of these actions, we are pursuing active interaction with our stakeholders, to ensure that this transition to risk-informed, and, where appropriate, performance-based regulation is completed in a deliberate, sensible, safety-conscious, and scientifically sound manner.       Conclusion      This completes my overview of the ongoing NRC transition to risk-informed regulation, and of the vital role that research must play in that transition.  In conclusion, I would note that some members of industry have expressed concerns that the NRC focus continues to be on developing the risk-informed  framework , and that as yet our licensees have not realized any substantial positive impact or relief from NRC efforts.  In addition to continued development of foundational elements, we are accelerating our efforts to achieve definite, measurable outcomes in all license-initiated requests.  Let me assure you, without ambiguity, that the Commission metric for success in this area is  not  simply the completion of a framework-but in fact is the  implementation  of that framework, and the  use  of associated guidance documents.  In short, we will not be content simply by having published ""outputs.""  Rather, we will measure success by our achievement of the desired ""out comes .""  Your discussions and deliberations here will help both to achieve and to measure those outcomes.      I hope that I have given you a clear sense of the strong Commission commitment to developing a risk-informed regulatory framework that will encompass all NRC regulatory oversight functions, and that will underlie and provide a defensible, coherent basis for future decision-making.  I hope that I have given you additional perspective on how far we have come, and on where we are headed.  I also hope that you understand more fully the value of previous and future research accomplishments as part of this overall effort.  The Commission will continue to make every effort to assure that NRC activities, including our research program, are focused on providing the information needed to support risk-informed decision-making.  Thank you."

Introduction      Good morning.  I am very pleased to be addressing this conference on Plant Life Management and Plant Life Extension--an excellent forum for discussing and sharing insights on the technical, commercial, and strategic issues of nuclear plant life management.  This lovely city of Prague, with its mixture of well-preserved history, renovation, renewal, and state-of-the-art technology, offers a near-perfect setting for discussing these important subjects.  The current state of the nuclear power industry in the United States in some ways is a similar mixture, a combination of first-generation operating reactors, considerations for license renewal, and an industry seeking to use technological advances to improve operational efficiency and to reduce operating and maintenance costs without compromising public health and safety.      I would like to focus your attention today on four areas with direct bearing on plant life management and plant life extension:  (1) the development and application of safety margins; (2) aging mechanisms and the use of inspection and testing methods; (3) the U.S. license renewal process; and (4) risk-informed, performance-based regulation.      II.  Development and Application of Safety Margins      The initial designs of U.S. commercial nuclear power plants included significant margins of safety for a variety of vital parameters.  Explicit margins were established and required by the various design codes and regulations.  These explicit margins are well-known and documented, and have evolved somewhat over time as operational experience has accumulated and design analysis methods have improved.      Another set of safety margins also were included in these plant designs, which I will call ""implicit"" margins.  These implicit margins resulted from the conservative assumptions and materials data that were incorporated into design, procurement, construction, and operational guidance.  Individual margins were introduced to address specific uncertainties, by applying conservative judgments in the development of design and operating codes, as well as in promulgating regulations.  However, in many cases, the implicit margins from one aspect of a design intersected with or were combined with the implicit margins from another aspect, sometimes yielding a much different margin than anticipated.  These compounding effects sometimes were increased further in areas where implicit safety margins intersected with explicit margins.      For some plants, aging effects can complicate the picture both from a technical and financial point of view.  The emergence of aging considerations may affect the ability of a plant to satisfy these margins.  Examples of requirements that include both implicit and explicit margins include:  (1) slow heatup and cooldown rates, set to ensure protection of the reactor pressure vessel; and (2) criteria for evaluating the flaw indications detected during in-service inspections.  In certain key areas, such as the effect of radiation embrittlement on reactor pressure vessel integrity, conservatism makes sense if definitive data to the contrary is lacking.      Attempting to satisfy these combined margins can have significant technical and financial impact on plant operators, who are monitoring carefully and balancing plant performance and its capital, operation, and maintenance costs.      License renewal (extension of a nuclear power plant 40-year operating license for an additional 20 years) is explicitly allowed in NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 54.  For a utility considering license renewal, these technical and financial aspects are important considerations to be weighed against the benefits to be derived from the license renewal itself.  I will return to the subject of license renewal for U.S. commercial nuclear power plants, but first let me speak briefly to issues surrounding inspection and testing methods for the evaluation of age-related degradation of key systems, structures, and components.      III.  Aging Considerations and the Use of Inspection and Testing Methods      The key aging degradation mechanisms are well-known--irradiation damage, fatigue, environmentally assisted cracking, erosion, various corrosion mechanisms, and so on.  Some of these mechanisms have resulted in forced plant shutdowns, such as the shutdown of several boiling water reactors due to concerns over intergranular stress corrosion cracking in piping systems.  Others, such as irradiation embrittlement of the reactor pressure vessel and steam generator tube degradation, have brought about the permanent closure of some plants.  Still other effects, such as the flow accelerated corrosion in feedwater and steam piping, have resulted in property damage and loss of life.      But these are the higher profile cases.  Aging degradation affects, or may affect, a broad range of plant systems, structures, and components.  Aging must be addressed in areas as diverse as the degradation of electrical cable insulation, degradation of concrete structures, degradation of service water piping, and the degradation and cracking of reactor internals.  We also are looking the into possible effects of aging on the torque required to ensure operation of motor operated valves under design basis conditions after they have been exposed to operating environments for several years.      For active components, such as pumps and valves, periodic in-service testing can provide confidence that the component will work as designed.  Current testing programs are quite comprehensive but also quite costly, and a number of U.S. initiatives are underway to optimize those testing programs.      For passive structures and components, monitoring and periodic inspection are  needed to ensure that aging degradation is not challenging the safety function.  However, some of these structures and components may have been inspected only once over the life of the plant.  In addition, this sampling approach does not emphasize those locations that are experiencing degradation.  For example, in-service inspection programs for piping systems have missed fatigue cracking in some cases, resulting in service leaks and forced shutdowns.  In addition, some inspection techniques simply are not as effective as one might expect.  The experience with eddy current inspection of steam generator tubes over the last few years certainly has shown improvement, but even today we cannot size cracks accurately in certain steam generator tube locations.      An increased emphasis and reliance on in-service testing has resulted in certain improvements.  When it was discovered that ultrasonic testing, in certain cases, had missed leaking cracks, and had failed to detect other cracks that subsequently led to piping leaks, both the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the U.S. nuclear power industry came to the realization that a mechanism was needed that would require industry inspectors to demonstrate not only their personal knowledge of the inspection or testing process, but also the capabilities of the inspector  and  the inspection equipment and procedures.  This has become known as  performance   demonstration .  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has codified this concept into specific requirements in Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  The U.S. nuclear power industry subsequently initiated a large program to provide a framework for inspectors to satisfy the Code requirements.  The U.S. NRC has reviewed this industry initiative, and has found it to be an acceptable way for inspectors to demonstrate their capabilities, and to satisfy the Code.  We believe this has been an important step forward in improving confidence in the results of in-service inspections.  Currently, the NRC has an initiative underway to evaluate applying a similar approach to steam generator tube integrity.      I also should note that there is a large effort underway here in Europe to provide performance demonstration for qualifying non-destructive examination (NDE) techniques.  While we may have some differences in approach, we believe that an appropriate emphasis is being placed on demonstrating the capabilities of those inspectors and inspection procedures that are used to ensure the integrity of safety-significant passive components.      Before leaving the subject of in-service inspection and testing, let me mention the challenge I gave to the U.S. nuclear power industry and the international nuclear technical community shortly after becoming Chairman of the U.S. NRC.  I challenged the industry to draw on advanced technology to devise a method for directly measuring material properties on a more microscopic level, and to use it to develop better microscopic and predictive models for radiation-induced aging effects.  I believed then, and I continue to believe, that more direct, nondestructive measures of material properties and associated model development are possible.  My focus was on embrittlement of the reactor pressure vessel, but there are other applications in which direct measures of material properties would facilitate greatly decisions on the performance of critical components--for example, the degradation of electric cable insulation.  While some activity has occurred in this area, I actually had anticipated a more robust response.  So I will renew my challenge to  you , and to the scientific community at large.  I believe this is an area in which we can make substantial progress, and in which that progress would help to build confidence for the continued safe operation of nuclear power plants.  I also believe it may have important cost-saving implications in the future, if used to validate extended plant life.      IV.  License Renewal Process      Let me turn now to the subject of license renewal, a topic of considerable interest in the U.S.  By way of background:  about 10 percent of the remaining U.S. nuclear plant licenses will expire by the end of 2010 (with the first to expire in 2006), and more than 40 percent will expire by 2015.  The timely renewal of licenses for an additional 20 years, where appropriate, may be important to the economic viability of a utility, due to the additional time over which capital investments can be amortized.  It may be important to ensuring an adequate energy supply mix for the U.S. during the first half of the 21st century.  It also could play into the debate over the mitigation of global warming.       For nuclear power plant licensees, license renewal can be a two-edged sword.  The benefits of gaining 20 years on the existing investment must be weighed against the uncertainties associated with the cost of renewal, based on a consideration of economic, political, regulatory, and environmental factors.  As I earlier indicated, uncertainties may exist associated with future operation and maintenance costs.  The timing of major replacements, such as steam generators--or major maintenance operations such as thermal annealing--are major factors to be considered.       In the U.S., the decision on whether to seek license renewal rests with a licensee.  The NRC task is to establish a reasonable process and clear safety standards, so that licensees can make timely decisions about whether to seek license renewal.      For our part, the NRC has created the regulatory structure to support license renewal.  The Commission published the original license renewal rule, 10 CFR Part 54, in December 1991.  However, several provisions of that rule, related to implementation issues, raised significant concerns in the nuclear power industry.  After reviewing public comments, conducting stakeholder workshops, and considering carefully the various issues raised, the Commission published an amended license renewal rule in May 1995, revising the requirements that an applicant must meet to obtain a renewed operating license.      The amended rule is based on two key principles.  The first principle is that the current regulatory process, continued into the extended period of operation, is considered adequate to ensure that the current licensing basis provides the foundation for, and will help to maintain, an acceptable level of safety, with the possible exception of detrimental aging effects for certain systems, structures, and components.  The second key principle is that the licensing basis for each plant must be maintained during the renewal term.  In other words, the foundation of license renewal hinges on the determination that currently operating plants will continue to maintain adequate levels of safety, and that maintenance of the licensing basis has helped and must continue to help to sustain these safety levels over the life of the plant.  This assumes appropriate adjustments to address aging effects identified during license renewal review, and to address relevant operating experience.      In support of license renewal efforts, the NRC staff issued a Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that reviewed over 90 possible environmental impacts of license renewal.  Out of this group, more than 60 issues were ranked as Category 1 and analyzed generically, based on meeting three criteria:  (1) the issue was generic in scope to all licensees; (2) the potential impact, whether high, medium, or low, was the same for all licensees; and (3) no sufficiently beneficial mitigation measures existed which licensees had not already taken.  For these issues, covered in the GEIS, license renewal applicants need not perform a site-specific analysis, but simply can adopt the analysis given in the GEIS.  For the remaining issues, ranked as Category 2, applicants will need to present plant-specific impact analyses in their environmental reports.      One issue that has caused some potential applicants concern relates to the environmental impact of transporting high-level waste (HLW) to the proposed U.S. geologic repository at Yucca Mountain.  At the time the GEIS was produced, given the uncertain status of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) activities at Yucca Mountain, this issue was designated as Category 2, requiring plant-specific environmental impact review.  In June 1997, the Commission asked the staff to revisit this issue, and to prepare a set of options, both near-term and long-term, for treating environmental impact analyses related to HLW transportation and disposal for license renewal applications.  The staff recently completed this effort, and the options developed are currently under Commission review.      The current U.S. nuclear power industry approach to license renewal is to submit for NRC approval plant-specific and Owners' Group technical reports on specific topics, prior to submitting complete license renewal applications.  This approach is intended to establish a foundation of technical information that a licensee can use to evaluate the feasibility of a license renewal application, and to reference that information later in the application itself.  The NRC is reviewing plant-specific technical reports prepared by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company addressing the Calvert Cliffs units, and by the Duke Power Company addressing the Oconee units.  We also are reviewing generic reports prepared by owners groups, including the Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) Owners' Group on behalf of five operating B&W plants, the Boiling Water Reactor Owners' Group, and the Westinghouse Owners' Group, which has submitted reports on several structures and components.  This level of activity on the part of the U.S. nuclear power industry clearly reflects a serious interest in license renewal.      Some members of the U.S. nuclear power industry also have expressed concerns related to the efficiency of NRC license renewal processes, and in particular the possibility of unnecessarily lengthy hearings.  As you may be aware, the Commission always has the authority to exercise its inherent supervisory authority over the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings, and has done so in the past, both to provide guidance to its Atomic Safety Licensing Board (which conducts adjudicatory licensing proceedings) on novel issues and to direct the use of expedited schedules.  When the Commission adjudicatory review process was revamped several years ago to make the Commission the sole appellate body, it gave the Commission greater opportunity and flexibility to exercise oversight of its adjudicatory processes.  In addition, we may be able to modify certain internal NRC procedures in a way that would increase the efficiency of reviews, safety evaluations, or other aspects of the license renewal process.  I should mention, however, that in an era of fiscal restraint, the level of NRC staff resources applied to this area must remain commensurate with the degree of foreseen activity and the existing initiatives by potential license renewal applicants.  We remain confident that we can address current and future challenges, and craft a clear and stable regulatory process for license renewal in the United States.      V.  Risk-Informed, Performance-Based Regulation      One of my early initiatives as the NRC Chairman was to push for greater use of risk information and, where appropriate, a performance-based approach in our regulatory activities--in other words, risk-informed, performance-based regulation.  I believed then, and continue to believe, that a risk-informed, performance-based approach to regulation benefits the agency, the industries we regulate, and the public--through better decision-making, more judicious use of resources, and the reduction of unnecessary burdens.      In developing a proposed strategy for the reassessment of regulatory requirements, and for moving to risk-informed, performance-based regulation, our fundamental objective is to incorporate more risk-informed thinking into NRC rulemaking, licensing, inspection, and enforcement, so that NRC regulations  and  the prioritization of NRC activities are consistent with the actual risk importance of the issues involved.  The most demanding requirements and the highest resource commitments should be directed at the highest risk contributors.  Less demanding requirements and lesser resource commitments should be directed at less important contributors.      In order to accomplish this, it is important for us to have a common understanding on the meaning of the term ""risk-informed, performance-based regulation.""   A ""risk-informed"" approach means that, in the decision-making process, quantitatively derived risk information is considered along with other factors such as the need for defense-in-depth, good engineering practice, and operating experience.  Risk information does not become the sole basis for a decision (that is, the decision is  not  ""risk-based""), but rather provides a systematic way of identifying and comparing what is important and where uncertainties exist.      Recently, increased attention has been focused on ""performance-based"" regulation.  Performance-based regulation is, by definition, results focused--that is, focused on meeting certain performance objectives, whether selected for and applied to human operational performance, to the efficacy of licensee corrective actions, to equipment, or to some other measure of licensee behavior.  Performance-based initiatives should be selected where objective performance criteria can be established and reliably measured for performance monitoring, and where failure to meet the performance criteria results in  tolerable  conditions for which appropriate corrective action will be taken in a timely manner.  Of course, if failure to meet performance criteria could result in  intolerable  conditions, we will continue to pursue a more prescriptive approach.      An essential component of a performance-based approach is the feedback of actual operating experience into subsequent evaluations.  For example, for equipment, as data from performance monitoring of structures, systems, and components are accumulated, the NRC expects licensees to incorporate that performance data by re-evaluating previous assumptions and making any needed adjustments--not only to  reduce  testing or other requirements, but also, where appropriate, to increase test frequency, to incorporate additional performance monitoring, or to perform additional or more frequent maintenance.  In fact, this is what the new NRC Maintenance Rule requires.  When the results focus or performance basis is linked to risk analysis and ranking, the result is risk-informed, performance-based regulation.      The Commission intends to incorporate risk analysis into all relevant regulatory matters, to the extent supported by the law and by the state of the art in risk analysis methods and data.  This philosophy was articulated in the 1995 Commission Policy Statement on the use of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods, and is being implemented across the full range of NRC functions.  The Commission has devoted considerable focus to ensuring the development and application of effective guidance--both for the NRC staff and for licensees--for incorporating risk insights into decision-making.  As one example, for nuclear power plant operators, the NRC staff currently is developing criteria to evaluate the risk contributions of proposed licensee changes to their plants, procedures, or their licenses themselves.  These criteria may reference various elements of the Commission Safety Goals or their subsidiary numerical objectives, and thus become, in effect, plant-specific applications of the goals and subsidiary objectives.      In addition, as some of you are aware, we have been conducting a series of pilot applications with the U.S. nuclear power industry in the areas of Technical Specifications (TSs), Graded Quality Assurance (QA), In-Service Inspection, and In-Service Testing, using the draft probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) Standard Review Plans and draft PRA Regulatory Guides which the NRC published and released for public comment earlier this year.  The NRC staff has received license amendment applications in each of these four topical areas, and we are well into the process of reviewing and issuing the associated Safety Evaluation Reports.  As one example, the staff has been working with the Combustion Engineering Owners Group (CEOG) on a joint application that would modify existing CE TSs to allow a degree of risk-informed operating flexibility.  This TS change would allow licensees to employ a Configuration Risk Management Program to make decisions on whether or not to enter an extended Allowed Outage Time on specific plant structures, systems, and components, based on incorporating probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) insights into the analysis of the existing or intended plant configuration.  A similar TS change was issued for the South Texas plant last year.  In May, the Commission reviewed this program and did not object to the issuance of safety evaluations using this rationale.  This program is illustrative of the types of enhancements that are being achieved through a risk-informed approach to regulation.      A risk-informed, performance-based approach also must be taken in the evaluation of research needs.  First, as operating experience or the results of other research identifies new issues, each such issue must be evaluated in terms of its relative importance.  Risk analysis provides a consistent, systematic framework for this evaluation, since it provides an integrated look at plant systems and potential accidents.  Secondly, in planning research on a specific issue, the systematic use of risk information can help to identify what is needed to answer the focal question or to reduce uncertainties associated with it.  For example, nuclear reactor shutdown operations involve a wide range of activities.  Which of these pose the greatest risk?  What is the level of risk?  What could and should be done to reduce this risk?  Risk assessment is a useful tool in answering such questions--and, in fact, the NRC staff has conducted limited-scope shutdown risk assessments, and is proposing to initiate an additional study to improve agency understanding of shutdown safety issues.  Thirdly, risk assessment work itself can identify areas in which additional research is needed to reduce uncertainties and to improve the quality of data or analysis methods.  Finally, risk assessment can be useful in prioritizing research programs.  As resources and issues change, difficult choices must be made regarding which programs to continue, and which to reduce or terminate.  On a very practical note, recent U.S. Congressional action on the NRC Fiscal Year 1998 budget may affect some of our research programs, and if any such changes are necessary, we will endeavor to make them in a risk-informed fashion.      VI.  Conclusion      As we approach the 21st century, the nuclear power industry faces an array of challenges and opportunities.  The economic constraints already facing some nuclear power plants are significant.  Controlling operating and maintenance costs, dealing with increased competition, and recovering stranded costs are considerations that have suggested that some plants may not be financially viable.  In the U.S., we have seen five nuclear plants close, and several others have announced plans that could lead to early closure.  All is not, and need not be, doom and gloom, however.  Nuclear power  is  and can be economic, if properly managed for reliability and safety.  Because of this, as I have discussed, there is considerable interest in license renewal in the U.S. nuclear power industry.      As we move into the future, we will need effective programs for monitoring, inspecting, and testing systems, structures, and components to ensure that aging degradation is detected, characterized, mitigated, and managed over the operating life of the plants.  In this context, effectiveness must be measured by early and reliable detection, accurate characterization, and low implementation costs.  The risk-informed performance-based approach offers the potential for both cost and worker dose savings.  Performance demonstration can help to provide confidence in inspection capabilities, and research programs can provide insights into the types and nature of the degradations for which we need to inspect, and how to model them and their progression over time.      In closing, let me again reiterate that the primary interest of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission remains ensuring the adequate protection of public health and safety.  To that end, operational safety remains paramount.   In addition, we who regulate must continue to examine our effectiveness as regulators, and we must position ourselves for change.  We will continue to work with the nuclear power industry to improve the effectiveness of inspection and test programs.  We also believe that advances in our analytical tools and material property characterizations can provide a basis for examining and potentially changing some of the inherent margins in our regulatory analyses, while ensuring safe performance of the affected systems, structures, and components.  These improvements, in turn, may lead to reductions in costs and worker exposures as well as to improvements in safety.  These are important considerations today, and they will continue to be important in the future, not just for the U.S. nuclear power industry, but for the international nuclear community as well.  Thank you."

Hallberg (Sweden) as Vice-Chairman for 1996. 1.2 The session was attended by representatives from the following countries: JAPAN LATVIA LIBERIA MALTA MEXICO NETHERLANDS NORWAY PANAMA POLAND PORTUGAL REPUBLIC OF KOREA ROMANIA RUSSIAN FEDERATION SOLOMON ISLANDS SPAIN SWEDEN TUNISIA TURKEY UKRAINE UNITED KINGDOM UNITED STATES URUGUAY VENEZUELA  ARGENTINA AUSTRALIA BAHRAIN BELGIUM BRAZIL CANADA CHILE CHINA COLOMBIA CUBA CYPRUS DENMARK EGYPT ESTONIA FINLAND FRANCE GHANA GERMANY GREECE ICELAND INDONESIA IRELAND ISRAEL ITALY and by the following Associate Member of IMO: HONG KONG  1.3 The following United Nations specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non -governmental organizations were also represented: INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION UNION (ITU) WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO) INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO) COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (EEC) INTERNATIONAL MOBILE SATELLITE ORGANIZATION (Inmarsat) COSPAS -SARSAT INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC) EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADMINISTRATIONS (CEPT) INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF SHIPPING (ICS) INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION (IEC) I:\COMSAR\1\30.   -5-  COMSAR 1/30  INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS (ICFTU) INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LIGHTHOUSE AUTHORITIES (IALA) INTERNATIONAL RADIO -MARITIME COMMITTEE (CIRM) INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES (IACS) OIL COMPANIES INTERNATIONAL MARINE FORUM (OCIMF) INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF SHIPMASTERS' ASSOCIATIONS (IFSMA) INTERNATIONAL LIFEBOAT FEDERATION (ILF) INTERNATIONAL ROAD TRANSPORT UNION (IRU) INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF CRUISE LINES (ICCL) 1.4 In welcoming participants, Mr. E.E. Mitropoulos, Director of the Maritime Safety Division, on behalf of the Secretary -General, referred to the important decisions taken by the Maritime Safety Committee at its sixty-fifth session and the 1995 SOLAS Conference on Ro-Ro Ferry Safety pertinent to the Sub-Committee's work. He said that, in establishing the COMSAR Sub-Committee, the merger of the closely related and interdependent subjects of distress and safety radiocommunications and search and rescue (SAR) was most appropriate as it emphasized the importance of the new Sub-Committee and the benefit of this closer co-operation which should lead naturally to improved standards, better communication procedures, fewer false alerts and a greater contribution to safety of life at sea in general. Referring to the 1995 SOLAS Conference, he said the Sub-Committee would need to develop additional requirements, guidelines and performance standards so that all mandatory and recommendatory measures agreed by the Conference are in place by the target dates set by the Conference. He said the Sub-Committee would consider the decisions of the ITU World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) 1995 relating to IMO's work and should comment on them and propose a plan of joint IMO/ITU action to ensure that the interests of the maritime community are fully covered at future WRCs. With regard to SAR, he indicated the progress made intersessionally in the development of the International SAR Plan, harmonization of aeronautical and maritime SAR procedures and the revision of the IMOSAR and MERSAR manuals, as well as, the proposed amendments to the 1979 SAR Convention. He also was of the opinion that completion of the international SAR and GMDSS Master Plans were subjects of major importance on which the Sub -Committee should focus its attention over the next three sessions. He referred to the concern expressed at the Assembly, Council and MSC at the proliferation of Intersessional Working Groups and Correspondence Groups and advised the Sub-Committee to very carefully examine any proposals to establish such Groups. Finally he referred to the approved Guidelines for the Organization and method of work of the MSC and MEPC and their subsidiary bodies and the assigned priorities listed in the Sub-Committee's work programme (COMSAR 1/2, annex) and the importance of bearing the guidelines and priorities in mind when considering recommendations to the MSC on the work programme. 1.5 The agenda of the session, including a list of documents submitted under each agenda item, is given at annex 1. 2 DECISIONS OF OTHER IMO BODIES The Sub-Committee noted, in general, decisions pertaining to its work taken by the Committee at its sixty-fifth session, the twenty -sixth session of the LSR Sub-Committee, the twenty -seventh session of the I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  -6-  STW Sub-Committee, the thirty -eighth session of the DE Sub-Committee (COMSAR 1/2), the forty-first session of the NAV Sub-Committee, the third session of the FSI Sub-Committee (COMSAR 1/2/1), the nineteenth session of the Assembly (COMSAR 1/2/2), the 1995 SOLAS Conference (COMSAR 1/2/3) and also information on the outcome of DE 39 and took action as reported under the relevant sections of this report. 3 GLOBAL MARITIME DISTRESS AND SAFETY SYSTEM (GMDSS)  Matters related to the GMDSS Master Plan 3.1 The Sub-Committee noted that the latest edition of the GMDSS Master Plan (GMDSS/Circ.6) was circulated on 1 June 1995 to Member Governments and subsequently two corrigendas have been circulated. A number of responses to MSC/Circ.684 have been received since December 1995 and these will be used for updating the GMDSS Master Plan and a new circular (GMDSS/Circ.7) will be issued following COMSAR 1. 3.2 The Sub-Committee noted that a lot of the data in the GMDSS Master Plan may require updating and invited Member Governments to check their national data, in GMDSS/Circ.6, for accuracy and to provide the Secretariat with any necessary amendments, as soon as possible. The Committee was requested to similarly urge Members to examine GMDSS/Circ.7, when circulated, and provide any necessary amendments and also to respond to MSC/Circ.684, if they have not already done so. 3.3 The Sub-Committee noted COMSAR 1/3 (United States) on GMDSS information available over Internet on a computer bulletin board operated by the United States Coast Guard Navigation Centre, where a new computer system has been installed. The United States wished to share GMDSS information, experience * and problems with other Administrations as the system is implemented. Sixth North-Sea Regional Co-ordination Conference under the GMDSS (NRC/GMDSS) 3.4 The Sub-Committee no ted a report by Belgium (COMSAR 1/3/4) on the sixth NRC/GMDSS Conference which was held in Ostend from 30 May to 1 June 1995 to discuss a number of regional matters related to the GMDSS. 3.5 The United Kingdom delegation raised the problem of maintaining coast station watch on the frequency 500 kHz until 1 February 1999. The United States indicated that it had discontinued some services based on 500 kHz and that this had not affected its SAR services or operations. 3.6 The Sub-Committee agreed that there was a need to continue distress and safety services on 500 kHz until 1999 but recommended that regional co-ordination meetings, similar to those held for the North Sea by *  Send comments concerning the GMDSS in the United States to E-mail: CGComms/g-s@cgsmtp.uscg.mil, or telephone facsimile to +1(202) 267-4106.

This could assist Governments to mutually reduce the burden of all maintaining watch on 500 kHz until 1999. 3.7 The delegation of the Russian Federation informed the Sub-Committee tha t the 7th Baltic/Barents Sea Regional Meeting on Co-operation regarding the GMDSS (BBRC/GMDSS-7) would be held in Moscow from 13 to 14 May 1996; invitations to and details of the meeting were being circulated. Review of resolution A.606(15) 3.8 ICS (COMSAR 1/3/5), supported by some delegations, referred to the technological and other changes in short/medium-range and long-range radiocommunications since the GMDSS was first conceived in 1979 which are having a significant effect on the way ships carry out their non-safety communications. ICS considered that this may eventually result in the ship's GMDSS installation being used solely for distress, safety and routine navigational communications and this may be one of the causes of indecision on the part of Governments when considering the need to upgrade their shore-based maritime radio facilities to GMDSS standards. 3.9 The Sub-Committee agreed to bear this point in mind when reviewing and evaluating resolution A.606(15) and considering the need to obtain a more definite response from those Governments which are still undecided as to the GMDSS shore-based facilities that should be provided nationally. Phased installation scheme for conversion to the GMDSS 3.10 The United Kingdom (COMSAR 1/3/7), informed the Sub-Committee that in response to COM/Circ.121, it had commenced a scheme whereby shipowners can adopt a phased installation programme which allows the installation of GMDSS equipment in stages while still using the equipment fitted for the old distress system. 3.11 The Sub-Committee, agreeing that the principle of phased introduction of GMDSS equipment might be applied, provided the requirements of SOLAS regulation IV/1.5.1 were met and the equipment would not be used until the GMDSS installation is complete and other GMDSS requirements met and that the radio operators were trained in the GMDSS, prepared the draft MSC/Circular on Implementation of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, given in annex 2, which the Committee is invited to approve for circulation to Member Governments. 3.12 Members were invited to submit to COMSAR 2 a summary of GMDSS equipment installation plans for ships under their flag and in addition, information on the number of GMDSS operator certificates they have issued and the number of certificates they have yet to issue to meet GMDSS manning standards by 1 February 1999. The Secretariat was instructed to summarize the submissions received in a document and submit it to COMSAR 2. 1995 ILF Conference 3.13 As instructed by the Committee (MSC 65/25, paragraph 3.11), the Sub-Committee considered resolution 3 of the 17th International Lifeboat Conference (MSC 65/13/2) which urges ILF Members to assist the work of IMO in promoting effective implementation of the GMDSS. The Sub-Committee expressed its appreciation to the ILF Conference and to ILF Members for any assistance they could give with regard to putting in place all the necessary components of the system before its full implementation on 1 February 1999. Information on Portuguese SAR database I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  -8-  3.14 The Sub-Committee noted information provided by Portugal (COMSAR 1/INF.8) on the establishment of a national database to be used by SAR Organizations. The database contains information on Portuguese ships MMSIs and satellite EPIRBs and other important SAR information and can be accessed 24 hours a day. Replies to the questionnaire on casualties 3.15 The Sub-Committee noted that no replies to the questionnaire on casualties had been submitted (COM/Circ.70/Rev.1) and deferred consideration of this sub-item to COMSAR 2. 3.16 The Sub-Committee urged Members to provide replies to the questionnaire resulting from any investigations into casualties which revealed problems with the GMDSS so that these matters could be considered by the Sub-Committee and action taken to prevent recurrence of the same problems. Exemptions from radio requirements 3.17 The Sub-Committee noted a table prepared by the Secretariat (COMSAR 1/3/8) providing information on the number of exemptions granted by SOLAS Contracting Governments under regulation IV/3 during the period from 1993 to 1995. The Sub-Committee also noted that some information provided by Contracting Governments to the Secretariat contained information on exemptions granted in accordance with old SOLAS regulation IV/5 in force prior to the 1988 SOLAS amendments, which is not applicable to the format approved by COM 40. 4 WORK CONSEQUENTIAL TO THE 1988 GMDSS CONFERENCE  Clarification of SOLAS GMDSS provisions 4.1 The Sub-Committee co nsidered COMSAR 1/3/1(United States) and COMSAR 1/7/7 (Norway) and decided that semi-automatic * and automatic** relays of distress alerts should not be permitted in the GMDSS (COMSAR 1/3/1, paragraphs 1.5.2 and 3). Further clarification of this and other procedures are covered in the recommended changes to Recommendation ITU-R M.541 on Operational Procedures for DSC, given in annex 3. The Secretariat was instructed to advise ITU-R Study Group 8 and Working Party 8B of these recommendations as well as the need to modify Recommendation ITU-R M.493. The Committee was invited to endorse this action. 4.2 The Sub-Committee also decided that performance standards for all DSC shipborne equipment should be modified to reflect this decision and instructed the Technical Working Group to consider COMSAR 1/3/1 for appropriate action at COMSAR 2. 4.3 Members were requested to ensure that all DSC equipment type approved for the GMDSS which has a provision for automatic and semi-automatic relays of distress alerts be modified to be in conformance with *  Semi-automatic: An operator receiving an unacknowledged distress alert on DSC, presses a button which transmits a DSC distress relay signal. The MMSI and position of the distressed ship is automatically derived from the received distress alert, but can also be manually entered by the operator. All GMDSS DSC radios have this feature. Automatic: A DSC radio receiving a distress alert, transmits a DSC distresss relay signal if the alert has not been acknowledged within five minutes, or if a second alert from the distressed ship is received. No action by a radio operator is necessary. Only certain GMDSS DSC radios have this feature.  **  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   -9-  COMSAR 1/30  Recommendation ITU-R M.541, as amended. 4.4 The Sub-Committee prepared COMSAR/Circ.1 regarding relays of distress alerts by digital selective calling and instructed the Secretariat to circulate it to Member Governments. The Committee is invited to endorse this action. 4.5 The NAV Sub-Comm ittee was invited to take COMSAR/Circ.1 into account when considering the development of the Code of Safe Navigation and Watchkeeping. The Secretariat was instructed to bring this paragraph and COMSAR/Circ.1 to the attention of NAV 42. 4.6 The Sub-Committee decided that all distress alerts from DSC equipment and Inmarsat-C SESs should include the current ship's position. For the existing DSC equipment which does not have automatic position updating or integral position determination equipment the requirements should be modified to delete the position information which is over 24-hours old, activate a special alarm and/or visual indication and replace the ten digits used for the position information with the digit ""9"". The four digits used for the time of the position validation should be replaced with the digit ""8"". For Inmarsat-C, the distress alert includes the time at which the position was last updated, using the 24-hour clock, and an indication as to whether that time refers to the previous 24-hours or some period prior to that. 4.7 The Technical Working Group was instructed to prepare draft amendments to the performance standards in accordance with COMSAR 1/3/1, paragraphs 3.1.1, 3.1.2; and 3.1.3 for consideration at COMSAR2. 4.8 The Sub-Committee instructed the Secretariat to inform ITU-R Study Group 8 and Working Party 8B of these recommended changes which relate to Recommendations ITU-R M.493 and ITU-R M.541. 4.9 The Sub-Committee, noting that a number of performance standards referenced by f ootnotes to SOLAS regulation IV/14 have been amended by the Assembly since publication of the 1992 consolidated edition of SOLAS, instructed the Secretariat to amend the references in the footnotes when preparing the next edition of the publication. 4.10 The Sub-Committee, recognizing the need for automatic position updating for GMDSS radiocommunication equipment, invited the Committee to authorize the Sub-Committee to develop a draft new SOLAS regulation on this subject. Consequential amendments would also be necessary with regard to existing regulation IV/13. 4.11 The Committee was also invited to request NAV 42 to consider paragraph 4.10 when developing requirements for carriage of electronic position-fixing equipment. 4.12 NAV 42 was also requested to: .1 include in its performance standards for electronic position-fixing receivers an NMEA 0183 version 2 or IEC 1162 interface connector requirement for connection to GMDSS equipment; and take into account the need to update the position information in GMDSS alerting systems at intervals not exceeding 4 hours and verify positions generated by electronic position-fixing systems, when developing the Code of Safe Navigation and Watchkeeping.  .2  4.13 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/7/3 (Australia) and agreed that resolution A.806(19) on performance standards for shipborne MF/HF radio installations capable of voice communication, narrowband direct-printing and DSC should be amended to include a minimum display screen size of 4 lines with 40 I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 10 -  alpha numeric characters per line. 4.14 The Sub-Committee decided avoid the use of abbreviations and, commonly used terms. This decision Party 8B for use when considering that the composition of distress messages should, as far as is possible, if used, abbreviations should be restricted to a minimum number of should be brought to the attention of the ITU-R Study Group 8 Working modifications to Recommendation ITU-R M.541.  4.15 The Sub-Committee also considered COMSAR 1/7/4 (United Kingdom) and agreed with their request to note the disruption caused to GMDSS communications due to inappropriate use of distress acknowledgement and distress relays by ships. The delegation of the United Kingdom suggested that it may be inappropriate for ships to acknowledge and relay distress alerts using DSC. The Sub -Committee did not totally agree with removal of this capability but recognized that it could be a problem and invited administrations and manufacturers to ensure that DSC distress acknowledgements and relay calls on all equipment can only be done manually. The Sub-Committee prepared COMSAR/Circ.2, which is intended to show a simple procedure for ships to follow when necessary to respond to DSC distress alerts in a sea area A2. The Secretariat was instructed to circulate it to Member Governments. The Committee was invited to endorse this action. 4.16 The Sub-Committee, considering COMSAR 1/3/2 (United States), agreed that shore authorities should be able to contact ships sending distress alerts in a more effective manner and prepared the draft MSC circular on guidance to Administrations on improving the capability of shore authorities to contact ships during situations involving distress or SAR operations, given at annex 4, which the Committee was invited to approve for circultion to Member Governments. Provision of registration databases 4.17 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/3/3 (United States) relating to the provision of registration databases used by RCCs. 4.18 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that there is a need to revise resolution A.764(18) so that it applies to all databases of identities used in GMDSS preformatted distress alerts, and ensure that information is available to RCCs on a 24-hour basis. Data on emergency contacts ashore is especially important to SAR personnel. Databases containing GMDSS identities should include date and, where feasible, source fields indicating when and from what source the identity was last updated. The Committee was invited to include revision of resolution A.764(18) in the Sub-Committee's work programme with a target completion date of 1998. 4.19 The Sub-Committee agreed to give consideration at COMSAR 2 to inviting ITU to add review of Articles 25, 26 and Appendix 9 of the Radio Regulations, to the agenda of the next competent World Radiocommunication Conference, if these items are to be kept in the Radio Regulations. The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that these Articles should be amended to apply resolution A.764(18) to ITU's database of GMDSS identities, to help to ensure that Administrations and organizations provide up-to-date information on GMDSS identity assignments, and to help ensure that such information is available to RCCs on a 24-hour basis. 4.20 The Sub-Committee, realizing the value of maritime mobile service identities (MMSIs) in identifying individual ships, invited the Committee to include MMSIs in the proposed International Ship Information Database (ISID). 4.21 The Sub-Committee agreed to consi der at COMSAR 2 the value of including MMSIs in port State databases and was of the opinion that Administrations participating in port State control agreements could be invited to bring this issue to the attention of the relevant regional bodies. I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 11 -  COMSAR 1/30  4.22 The Sub-Committee also agreed to consider the matter of revalidating actual MMSIs used on board ships. Members were invited to submit comments and proposals on this matter for consideration at COMSAR 2. 4.23 The Sub-Committee invited NAV 42 to consider inc luding the following new paragraph in the appropriate regulation of the revised SOLAS chapter V: "".... Each Contracting Government undertakes to ensure that suitable arrangements are made for assigning and registering Global Maritime Distress and Safety System identities and for making information on these identities available to Rescue Co -ordination Centres on a 24-hour basis. Where appropriate, international organizations maintaining a registry of these identities shall be notified of these assignments."" 4.24 The Sub-Committee invited Inmarsat to: .1 .2 apply resolution A.764(18) to its database of Inmarsat-C (maritime) and Inmarsat-E identities, and to other Inmarsat maritime identities where appropriate; and make available both listed and unlisted registrations of ship earth stations to RCCs as a matter of urgency.  4.25 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/3/6 (ICS) relating to the interruption of communications between RCCs and ships assisting in a SAR case, several important questions relating to the Achille Lauro case were raised. Members and Inmarsat were invited to provide more detailed information relating to this and similar cases and specifically information related to: .1 .2 .3 .4 ability to block routine communications to ships participating in the distress case; procedures for establishing and re-establishing communications with ships able to provide assistance; methods and procedures to guard against saturation of the available communication channels during a distress incident; and procedures to be applied aboard ships by the master to ensure the continuity of communications with RCCs.  4.26 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/4/4 (Norway) on the review of the locating function and could not agree to add a requirement to carry manually activated EPIRBs operating on frequency 121.5 MHz in survival craft due to the potential increase in false alerts and confusion to direction-finding equipment, which may result from multiple locating signals. However, the Sub-Committee did agree that a supplemental locating beacon should be added to the GMDSS, particularly, for use with fixed wing aircraft in remote areas, but could not, at this time, agree on the most suitable frequency. In view of this and the recommendations contained in Resolution 6 of the 1995 SOLAS Conference (SOLAS/CONF.3/46) the Sub-Committee invited the Committee to extend the target completion date of this sub-item in its work programme until 1997. Resolution 6 of the Conference requests that performance standards for low power locating beacons be developed for use on ro-ro ferries and that suitable frequencies be allocated for their use. Pending the Committee's instructions on these matters, the Sub-Committee invited Members to submit comments and proposals to COMSAR 2, taking into account the locating capabilities of search and rescue aircraft and the weight limitations on SAR aircraft for such additional facilities.  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 12 -  4.27 The Sub-Committee noted that the joint meeting of the SAR and Operational Working Groups during COMSAR 1 was considered a very useful tool to advance proposals affecting both GMDSS operational requirements and SAR requirements. It was agreed to continue this practice at future sessions. Priorities 4.28 Considering COMSAR 1/4 communications, the Sub-Committee automatic systems being designed for systems. The four levels of priority .1 .2 .3 .4 distress; urgency; safety; and routine. (Denmark) on priorities for maritime distress, urgency and safety confirmed its earlier decision to request four levels of priority for future use in the GMDSS. This will not apply to existing Inmarsat are as follows:  The Secretariat was instructed to convey this decision to the ITU-R Working Party 8B which is responsible for preparation of issues related to Article 61 of the Radio Regulations to be considered by WRC-97. 4.29 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/18/3 (ICS) which questioned t he use of the distress signals in distress relay messages relating to a person in distress. The Sub-Committee did not agree that the distress signals should be limited to cases involving ships and aircraft but suggested that detailed guidance concerning the use of distress, urgency and safety signals is needed to assist mariners involved with such cases. Members were invited to submit comments and proposals on this matter to COMSAR 2 for consideration. 4.30 The Sub-Committee also considered COMSAR 1/4/1 ( Denmark) and noted that action taken in paragraph 4.1 of this section completely satisfied the recommended actions proposed in this document. 4.31 The delegation of the United Kingdom informed the Sub-Committee that GMDSS incidents received at MRCC Falmouth, United Kingdom, in 1995 show a continued increase in false alerts. 997 GMDSS alerts were received, 959 of which proved to be false alerts (96%). This shows a 10.9% increase on 1994 false alerts. False alerts increased by: MF DSC Inmarsat-C EPIRBs 3% 50% 11.8%  This highlighted the need to clarify procedures for relay of distress alerts by ships and to enhance procedures to avoid false distress alerts. Members were invited to submit comments to COMSAR 2 relating to measures to reduce the proliferation of false alerts and to suggest actions to apply domestic regulation to impose penalties for misuse of GMDSS equipment. Servicing and testing of 406 EPIRBs 4.32 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/4/3 (Australia) concerning periodic testing of 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs. It was agreed that alternate procedures were in use that met the basic objective of this proposal. 4.33 The Sub-Committee agreed that 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs should be tested with regard to all aspects of operational efficiency with particular emphasis on frequency stability, signal strength and coding. The test may be conducted on board the ship or at an approved testing/servicing station at least once every I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 13 -  COMSAR 1/30  year. In cases where testing is not carried out in this manner, the EPIRB should undergo full servicing at an approved servicing station every two years or, at intervals as determined by the Administration. 4.34 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that this should be a maintenance and servicing requirement in the SOLAS Convention, possibly supported by guidelines, which could be developed by the SubCommittee. The Committee was invited to authorize the Sub-Committee to prepare suitable amendments to SOLAS regulation IV/15. 4.35 The Sub-Committee noted COMSAR 1/INF.9 (Nor way) describing an instrument to assist Radio Surveyors in testing GMDSS installations. The device will measure and record information on the majority of * GMDSS installations including the identification and technical parameters of the radio devices. 4.36 The Sub-Committee considered COM 40/WP.2/Add.1, annex 1, concerning guidance for shore-based maintenance. No contributions were received concerning this item. The Sub-Committee agreed that the guidance should be a draft new Assembly resolution and invited Members to submit comments and proposals on this matter to COMSAR 2 for consideration. Other matters 4.37 The Sub-Committee noted COMSAR 1/INF.2 (Denmark) concerning the use of a scanning facility to meet the ships general communication watch requirements. It was pointed out that Denmark has approved the use of a separate dedicated scanning facility to maintain watches for non-distress DSC channels, in accordance with the following criteria: .1 .2 .3 .4 the scanning facilities fulfil the IMO Performance Standards for DSC scanning receivers (resolution A.806(19) refers); only non-distress DSC calling frequencies are included in the scanning; the number of frequencies scanned in the sequence is limited to a maximum of six; and the scanning process is initiated automatically as soon as the handset is placed on its hook.  4.38 Norway (COMSAR 1/7/6) proposed to change the format of distress message for Inmarsat-C to include date, time, group and number of persons at risk. The Sub-Committee did not agree that there was an operational requirement to change the distress alert format to include these items and believed that its decisions taken in response to COMSAR 1/3/1 (see paragraph 4.6) met the objective to have current position information in the distress alert. Inmarsat also pointed out that during distress incidents the standard procedure should include a distress message following the alert message to provide such additional information to the RCC. Unfortunately, this procedure is not followed in the majority of cases and particularly those involving a false distress alert. 5 PROMULGATION OF MARITIME SAFETY INFORMATION (MSI)  Operational and technical co-ordination provisions of MSI services 5.1 The Sub-Committee noted that in accordance with the amendment procedure, prescribed in Annex 2 of resolution A.706(17) on the World-Wide Navigational Warning Service, MSC 65 (MSC 65/25, Additional information can be obtained from Radio Inspection Services of Telenor (phone: +47-22777519, fax: +47-222-01136) (Norway). I:\COMSAR\1\30. *   COMSAR 1/30  - 14 -  paragraphs 7.7 and 7.9) had adopted amendments prepared by COM 40, which are due to enter into force on 1 January 1997, and circulated them to Member Governments by MSC/Circ.685. 5.2 The Sub-Committee concurred with a proposal by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) (COMSAR 1/5/1) that information providers must monitor the broadcasts they originate and prepared amendments to resolution A.706(17), as amended by MSC/Circ.685. 5.3 The Committee is invited to adopt, in accordance with the amendment procedure prescribed in Annex 2 of resolution A.706(17), the proposed amendments, given in annex 5. The Sub-Committee also requested that the Committee invite IHO and the Secretariat to amend their publications and documents to reflect the proposed amendments. 5.4 The Sub-Committee concurred with the proposal by the Chairman of the IMO NAVTEX Co-ordinating Panel that NAVAREA Co-ordinators should take responsibility for the co -ordination of preliminary discussions between other Member States seeking to establish NAVTEX services and neighbouring Administrations within their area prior to formal application, in order to encourage the cost sharing of expensive coastal radio assets and to minimize the duplication of services and to avoid mutual interference between stations. This is included in new paragraph 6.2.1.16, given in annex 5. 5.5 With respect to COMSAR 1/5/3 (France), the Sub-Committee agreed that it is necessary that messages concerning search and rescue operations only be accepted by a NAVAREA co -ordinator for broadcast if they have been received from an authorized search and rescue authority in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.2.1.3.7 of resolution A.706(17). The Sub -Committee prepared COMSAR/Circ.3 on relations between NAVAREA Co-ordinators and RCCs and instructed the Secretariat to bring it to the attention of Member Governments. The Committee was invited to endorse this action. 5.6 IHO (COMSAR 1/5) informed the Sub-C ommittee that, following the request of COM 40 (COM 40/11, paragraph 4.23) to review the promulgation to mariners of the information contained in the GMDSS Master Plan and, in particular, the means for improving the dissemination to and receipt by ships of such information, the IHO Commission on Promulgation of Radionavigational Warnings (IHO CPRNW) reviewed the matter at its meeting in Athens, Greece from 26 to 28 September 1995, and noted that the IMO GMDSS Master Plan and the IMO GMDSS Handbook are accurate and detailed and therefore useful for National Hydrographic Offices and Telecommunications Authorities who have to issue and keep up to date official nautical publications. However, both IMO publications are large and cumbersome, not routinely updated and cannot be considered suitable as a Mariner Users Guide. 5.7 The Sub-Committee, concurring with the opinion of the CPRNW that MSI communications and related information contained in the GMDSS Master Plan and in the GMDSS Handbook is most appropriately provided to ships in the official LISTS OF RADIO SIGNALS published by National Hydrographic Offices or Telecommunication Authorities and kept up to date on a routine basis by Notices to Mariners, agreed that these publications should be accepted for carriage to meet the requirements of SOLAS regulation V/20. 5.8 Taking into account COMSAR 1/INF.6 (IHO and WMO), the Sub-Committee prepared COMSAR/Circ.4 on the Joint IMO/IHO/WMO Manual on Maritime Safety Information (MSI Manual) and instructed the Secretariat to bring it to the attention of Governments. The Committee was invited to endorse this action. 5.9 In view of the work being done to standardize distress alert formats (COMSAR 1/9/8) and to develop amendment procedures for the MSI ManuaI, IHO and WMO recommended the amendments to the MSI Manual which have been approved by the Sub-Committee as an interim correction to the document but that action on final approval of the manual as an IMO publication, should await completion of the work on the I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 15 -  COMSAR 1/30  Standardization of Distress Alert formats. The Sub-Committee invited the Committee to include review of the MSI Manual in the Sub-Committee's work programme with a target completion date of 1998. 5.10 The IHO observer advised the Sub-Committee that there had been changes to the List of NAVAREA Co-ordinators (COM/Circ.123) and the Sub-Committee prepared COMSAR/Circ.5 revising COM/Circ.123 and instructed the Secretariat to bring it to the attention of Governments. The Committee is invited to endorse this action. 5.11 The Sub-Committee noted that: .1 COM 40 again postponed taking a decision on the delimitation of the sub-areas between Bahrain and Qatar for the promulgation of MSI in the Persian Gulf and invited Bahrain and Qatar to seek an informal compromise agreement on that issue. If no agreement can be reached, Bahrain and Qatar were invited, pending final settlement between them, either to accept overlapping service areas or to ensure that their NAVTEX broadcasts provide complete coverage of the area concerned and to inform the Secretariat accordingly; and as instructed by COM 40 (COM 40/22, paragraph 5.5), the Secretariat had brought the outcome of COM 40 on this matter to the attention of the Governments of Bahrain and Qatar.  .2  5.12 The Government of Bahrain, in its response (COMSAR 1/5/2), confirmed that the State of Bahrain will continue NAVTEX broadcasts covering the whole area in question so as to ensure the safety of shipping. The delegation of Bahrain made the Statement, given in annex 6. International SafetyNET service 5.13 The Sub-Committee recalled that COM 40 had prepared COM/Circ.122 on selection of more than one fixed area in the Inmarsat-C system and instructed the Secretariat to circulate it to Member Governments. MSC 65 (MSC 65/25, paragraph 7.27) had endorsed this action. 5.14 The Sub-Committee noted the present status of MSI broadcasts in the International SafetyNET service, given in annex 1 of GMDSS/Circ.6. The Chairman of the International SafetyNET Co -ordinating Panel provided new and revised information which had been received since GMDSS/Circ.6 had been finalized. These amendments are as follows: .1 .2 .3 .4 Pakistan commenced 31 January1996; broadcast of navigational warnings via SafetyNET on  Brazil began operational testing of SafetyNET broadcasts; India expects to commence Saf etyNET broadcasts of navigational warnings in March 1996; and South Africa expects to commence SafetyNET broadcasts of all MSI in April 1996.  The Sub-Committee instructed the Secretariat to take this into account when preparing GMDSS/Circ.7. 5.15 Concern was expressed by Argentina, supported by others, over the cost to the NAVAREA Co-ordinator of SafetyNET broadcasts. The Sub-Committee recommended minimizing such costs through: .1 the use of standardized message text and format (COMSAR/Circ.4);  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 16 -  .2 .3  elimination of warnings carried on NAVTEX unless they were of a nature which might cause a ship to alter its course substantially; and strict observance of the guidance on broadcast of SAR information.  5.16 MSC/Circ.584, paragraph 5 requests Inmarsat to urge their Inmarsat-C CES operators to make favourable arrangements for SafetyNET broadcasts of MSI traffic from countries lacking Inmarsat-C CES facilities. On the basis of this recommendation, the Sub-Committee appealed to Administrations, in particular those not operating CESs to make the necessary arrangements with telecommunication service providers, to carry SafetyNET information to CESs in order not to adversely affect the appropriate transmission of MSI for economical reasons. NAVTEX Co-ordinating Panel report 5.17 The Chairman of the Co-ordinating Panel: .1 expressed concern over the very slow implementation of the International NAVTEX service. There have been no applications for new stations in the past twelve months. Member States are encouraged to speed up their programmes prior to the final GMDSS implementation date of February 1999; noted that there is a need for co-ordination by the NAVAREA Co-ordinator of preliminary discussions between initiating Administrations and their neighbours to minimize duplication of resources and mutual interference and observed that there will be serious shortage of B1 character in Asian Region (NAVAREA XI) in the near future. Although IMO GMDSS Master Plan has not indicated this phenomenon so far, the research conducted by Japan for the third meeting of the IHO Commission on Promulgation of Radio Navigational Warnings shows that 16 NAVTEX stations have been operational and a further 16 stations are planned or under trial. This means that B1 characters have to be used twice in the same region; 8 stated that the NAVTEX Co-ordinating Panel will approve the use of the B 2 subject indicator group characters V, W, X & Y for special purposes, and advised Member States of the procedures for their allocation; reiterated the importance of monitoring NAVTEX and SafetyNET broadcasts by originating authorities (annex 5); and expressed concern that the Panel has received reports that B 3B4 characters 00 are being used for purposes other than distress. This practice puts mariners lives at risk and is in contravention of the NAVTEX Manual and the SOLAS Convention. Messages specified B3B4 character 00 are always printed on every receiver, therefore, this prefix should only be used for distress alert relays.  .2  .3  .4 .5  6  IMPLEMENTATION OF GMDSS REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF EXISTING FISHING VESSELS  6.1 The Sub-Committee noted that the Committee had approved MSC/Circ.682 on implementation of the GMDSS on board all ships for circulation to Member States. The MSC circular urges all Member Governments to assist in enhancing the safety of all ships at sea by encouraging all ships not subject to the 1974 SOLAS Convention or the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol to the 1977 Safety of Fishing Vessels Convention to be fitted for the GMDSS as soon as possible.  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 17 -  COMSAR 1/30  6.2 The Sub-Committee, noting that no documents have been s ubmitted under this agenda item since the thirty-ninth session of the COM Sub-Committee considered whether this item should be deleted from the Sub-Committee's work programme but, noting that MSC/Circ.682 referred to implementation of the GMDSS on board all ships and that further consideration needs to be given to a number of problems regarding the ""future implementation and use of the GMDSS by non-SOLAS convention ships"" and to MSC/Circ.469 Guidelines for the participation of non-Convention ships in the GMDSS, invited the Committee to consider replacing this item in its work programme with this broader subject with a target completion date of 1998. 6.3 Members were invited to consider both from a radiocommunication and SAR point of view the future application of the GMDSS to non-SOLAS convention ships and to submit comments and proposals thereon to COMSAR 2. 7 EMERGENCY RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS: FALSE ALERTS AND INTERFERENCE  7.1 In accordance with the NAV Sub-Committee's request, the Sub-Committee considere d (NAV 41/23, annex 14) the draft MSC circular on Special signals for use by ships under attack from pirates or armed robberies and supported it in general. The Sub-Committee was not completely satisfied with measures to avoid inadvertent activations contained in paragraph 7 of the draft circular. The following change to paragraph 7 was suggested ""to avoid false alarms, a positive activation of an access code known only to ships officers should be required to permit the Inmarsat-C SES to generate the alert message transmission. This could be activated by a programmed card or manually activated by pressing the code number on a numeric key pad"". 7.2 Nevertheless, the Sub-Committee was of the opinion that the draft MSC circular, so amended (COMSAR 1/WP.1/Add.1, annex 5), should be further considered at COMSAR 2. Members were invited to submit comments and proposals on this matter to COMSAR 2 for consideration. 7.3 The Secretariat was instructed to bring the above paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 to NAV infor 42 for mation.  7.4 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/7/1 (Sweden) proposing a draft new resolution to make all GMDSS installed equipment meet current performance standards by 1 February 1999. The delegation of Sweden indicated that they would prepare a preliminary draft Assembly resolution for consideration at COMSAR 2. 7.5 The Sub-Committee noted COMSAR 1/INF.7 (Portugal), COMSAR 1/INF.14 and COMSAR 1/INF.15 (Norway), pointing out that serious concern continues with the large percentage of false alerts with DSC and Inmarsat-C equipment. It was anticipated that, as more 406 MHz EPIRBs are installed, the number of false alerts would reduce and impact to SAR forces from them would lessen. This situation has not yet been evident. It was also noted that in alerting systems like the Inmarsat-A where a direct communication results from the call, false alarms seem to be less of a problem. This emphasizes the need for follow-on communications especially from DSC and Inmarsat-C systems. 7.6 The Chairman of the S AR Working Group, Mr. U. Hallberg (Sweden) noted with concern that distress alerts are creating a serious problem for the RCCs. This problem decreases the RCC staff confidence in the GMDSS. 7.7 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/7 (United States) and COMSAR 1/7/5 (IEC) relating to use of electronic light bulbs on board SOLAS ships. 7.8 It was noted that bulbs may produce harmful interference to radio equipment if the level of conducted spurious emissions exceeds the values of present relevant EMC standards (52V). dB  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 18 -  7.9 Therefore, the Sub-Committee was of the opinion that all relevant equipment should be required to fulfil the requirements laid down in resolution A.813(19) on general requirements for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) for all electrical and electronic ship's equipment. 7.10 The United States was of the opinion that as the bulb, described in COMSAR 1/7, produces V, conducted emissions exceeding 52 dB they should not be permitted to be used on board ships. 7.11 The Sub-Committee, not ing that false alerts and interference is a problem that will continue for many years to come, invited the Committee to retain this item as a continuous item in its work programme. 7.12 The Sub-Committee instructed the Secretariat to bring paragraphs 7.7 to 7.9 to the attention of the DE Sub-Committee for information. 8 SHIP IDENTIFICATION  406 MHz EPIRB 8.1 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/8 (COSPAS-SARSAT) explaining the availability of supporting information from the registration database on a 24-hour basis. Information including the MMSI and additional information relevant to the ship is available on a 24-hour basis from the 406 MHz EPIRB registration database. It was noted that in some cases, registration of this information has been made mandatory nationally. 8.2 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/8/2 (Russian Federation). The delegation of the Russian Federation proposed that two coding protocols seemed to be appropriate for the GMDSS. Other delegations also supported retention of the two options, i.e. MMSI and serialized coding protocols. There was also some support for retaining the coding with the radio call sign provided that additional data relevant to the rescue authorities was available from the database. Several delegations supported the retention of all options listed in resolution A.810(19). Although the use of serialized protocol was permitted in the GMDSS, the Sub-Committee decided to keep the MMSI as the preferred method to avoid confusion by SAR authorities and prepared the draft amendments to resolution A.810(19), given in annex 7, which allow the use of all three coding methods after 1 February 1999. 8.3 The Committee was invited to adopt the proposed draft amendments in accordance with operative paragraph 6 of resolution A.810(19) and to delete this item from the Sub-Committee's work programme. Ship Station Identification (SSI) numbers for DSC and SES 8.4 The Sub-Committee noted that COM 40 had agreed that: .1 .2 Inmarsat should be permitted to use the system code together with a system to retrieve additional information for use by RCCs; and in order to provide flexibility in the means available to make additional numbers available, it is no longer valid to require the ship's telephone number to be related to the ship's MMSI. Liaison statements on the above matters have been prepared and addressed to the appropriate ITU-R Study Groups. MSC 65 (MSC 65/25, paragraphs 7.22 and 7.23) had endorsed these actions.  8.5 The Sub-Committee, taking into account paragraph 8.4 and noting that no documents relating to SSI numbers for DSC and SES have been submitted for consideration at this session, was of the opinion that the work on this matter is completed. The Committee was invited to delete this sub-item from the SubI:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 19 -  COMSAR 1/30  Committee's work programme. VTS and Identification Transponders 8.6 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/8/1 (United Kingdom) on channel loading for DSC on VHF channel 70 and noted that automatic ship identification systems using DSC techniques could operate on channel 70 while still leaving capacity for public correspondence calling and without affecting distress alerts. It was also noted that future automatic ship identification systems and VTS might be designed for faster updating of position and would exceed the channel 70 loading limits and would therefore need special VHF channels. 8.7 It was reiterated that existing VHF GMDSS equipment complying with the IMO performance standards cannot, without modification, be used with automatic ship identification systems and that separate dedicated equipment would give greater flexibility in the design of the systems. However, it was pointed out that equipment combining GMDSS and VTS purposes could enhance the implementation of VTS, but a combined equipment cannot employ automatic identification or position updating when used for other purposes and cannot also use the existing manual equipment. 8.8 The Sub-Committee, noting that further work was necessary on this item, invited the Committee to extend its target completion date in the Sub-Committee's work programme to 1998. 9 MATTERS CONCERNING SEARCH AND RESCUE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE 1979 SAR CONFERENCE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GMDSS  Harmonization of aeronautical and maritime search and rescue procedures 9.1 The Sub-Committee noted the two resolutions adopted by the 1995 International Lifeboat Federation (ILF) Conference (MSC 65/13/2) referred to it by the Committee which: .1 invited the Secretary-General of IMO to inquire about the status of implementation of measures to protect coastal rescue craft as provided for under the Second Geneva Convention and the International Code of Signals and urged IMO to put in place any necessary measure to minimize any additional risk to the crews of coastal rescue craft; and urged ILF Members to assist the work of IMO in promoting the effective implementation of the GMDSS.  .2  9.2 The Sub-Committee welcomed the offer of assistance by ILF Members to the Organi zation in promoting the effective implementation of the GMDSS and recalled in this regard that MSC/Circ.682 approved by the Committee at its sixty-fifth session had urged all Governments to assist in enhancing the safety of all ships and their crews at sea by encouraging all ships not subject to the 1974 SOLAS Convention or the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol to the 1977 Safety of Fishing Vessels Convention to be fitted for the GMDSS as soon as possible. 9.3 With regard to the protection of rescue craft during armed conflict, the Sub-Committee agreed that as States and not the Organization are Parties to the Geneva Convention, it is up to the Parties to take, as far as possible, all necessary legal and administrative measures to protect their coastal rescue craft in accordance with the Second Geneva Convention and Protocol 1 to the Convention. The Sub-Committee recalled that at its thirtieth session (COM 30/11, paragraph 10.2.3), the COM Sub-Committee had agreed to a proposal by the ILF on radiotelephony and radar identification of rescue craft during armed conflict. The Sub-Committee agreed that the principle of the protection of rescue craft during armed conflict should be included in the Joint I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 20 -  ICAO/IMO SAR Manual and in the MERSAR Manual. 9.4 The Sub-Committee agreed with a proposal by Australia (COMSAR 1/9/7) to amend the SAR Convention to include a requirement that in addition to the present colour coding for droppable survival stores containers, bands of suitable pictograms in retro-reflective material be used to identify the contents of the containers. For existing containers, retro-reflective materials are to be used to improve their visibility. New containers should be made in highly visible colours. 9.5 The Sub-Committee noted that Australia had offered to submit a proposal to COMSAR 2 on suitable pictograms and invited interested Members to send their contributions to the Australian Co-ordinator *. The Sub-Committee also noted that at the third session of the Joint ICAO/IMO Working Group on Harmonization of Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (JWG 3), Italy offered to contribute the aeronautical views on the pictograms. Report of the second session of the Joint ICAO/IMO Working Group on Harmonization of Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue 9.6 The Sub-Committee noted the report of the second session of the ICAO/IMO Working Group on Harmonization of Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (JWG) (COMSAR 1/9/2) and the comments thereon by the SAR Working Group at LSR 26. Report of the third session of the Joint ICAO/IMO Working Group on Harmonization of Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue 9.7 The Sub-Committee noted (COMSAR 1/9/9) the report of the third session of the Joint ICAO/IMO Working Group on Harmonization of Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (JWG) held in Goteborg (Sweden) from 16 to 20 October 1995 in general and, in particular: .1 noted that as a means to follow up decisions taken so that its future work would be more readily identified, the Joint Working Group (JWG) had instructed the Secretariat to prepare a list of recommendations made at previous meetings for internal use by the JWG, listing agenda items and actions taken by the JWG; noted that even though a joint manual was presented to the JWG, the United States had offered to prepare a new joint manual in three parts, and that the provisional Joint ICAO/IMO SAR Manual which was prepared by the JWG would be available for review by JWG 4 and COMSAR2; noted that the JWG had recommended that ICAO Annex 2 be amended to include a  .2  .3 *  Mr. B.

The Sub-Committee noted that the meetings of the Joint Working Group are open to all Member Governments, who may attend as observers. 9.9 Norway (COMSAR 1/INF.12), commenting on the report of the SAR Working Group, given in COMSAR 1/9/2, did not support the phasing-out of satellite processing of 121.5 MHz alert signals early in the next century. Norway was of the opinion that it would be an inappropriate way of reducing false distress alerts and would be to the detriment of people in distress. 9.10 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that 121.5 MHz beacons are one of the causes of frequent false distress alerts, they adversely affect the GMDSS and RCCs and the use of 121.5 MHz should eventually be restricted to voice and homing applications. COSPAS-SARSAT was invited to take this opinion into account in considering whether to continue processing 121.5 MHz signals, and to provide early notification of any decision to discontinue such processing. ICAO was invited to inform COSPAS-SARSAT of ICAO's opinion on this matter. Plan for the provision of maritime SAR services including procedures for routeing distress information in the GMDSS 9.11 The United States (COMSAR 1/9), in reviewing the status of the global SAR plan, proposed inclusion of minimum standards for RCCs in the IMO SAR Manual and suggested that only RCCs which have been assessed by the States concerned as meeting the minimum standards should be included in the IMO SAR Plan. The United States recommended that IMO assist States developing their SAR services, by identifying what they need to do in order to implement effective SAR co-ordination and by providing them with information and training materials. In COMSAR 1/9/1, the United States highlighted some operational issues which are vital to effective SAR operation and proposed the inclusion of a number of items in the SubCommittee's work programme to address the issues raised. 9.12 The Sub-Committee concurred with the proposal by the United States (COMSAR 1/9/5) on the need to improve the efficiency of SAR operations by reducing the workload on RCCs through streamlining the procedures and improvements to shore-based infrastructure and prepared the draft Assembly resolution on Guidance to Administrations on development of shore-based SAR telecommunication infrastructure, given in I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 22 -  annex 8, which the Committee was invited to approve for submission to the twentieth Assembly for adoption. 9.13 The Sub-Committee agreed to refer the proposal for IMO to initiate a dialo gue with ICAO concerning the potential shared use of ICAO's Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) to JWG 4 for consideration and advice. 9.14 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/9/6 (United States) and, noting that the proposals therein relate to ship reporting matters, agreed to refer the document to the NAV Sub-Committee for consideration and action as appropriate. 9.15 The Sub-Committee also requested the Secretary-General to invite the attention of ICAO to the usefulness of reporting systems in SAR operations and their relation to the provisions of ICAO, Annex 12, paragraph 4.1.3. 9.16 The Sub-Committee agreed with a proposal by Australia (COMSAR 1/9/8) that there is a need for standardization of distress alert formats for passing messages between RCCs and national SAR authorities in another country. Using COMSAR 1/9/8 as a basis, the Sub-Committee prepared the draft preliminary model formats for distress alerts, to transfer information via Inmarsat-C, Inmarsat-E, Digital Selective Calling (DSC) and COSPAS-SARSAT systems, given in annexes 2 to 6 of COMSAR 1/WP.7, for inclusion in the Joint IMO/ICAO SAR Manual. The Sub-Committee noted that the JWG 3 also approved the proposed standard formats. 9.17 The United Kingdom (COMSAR 1/9/10) invited the Sub-Committee's attention to the duplication of SAR efforts which occurs when the same distress alert is received and is acted upon by several RCCs each unaware that others are also involved. The situation is common when the alert does not contain the ship's position or is from a position for which there is no known responsible RCC. To reduce waste, the United Kingdom proposed an improvement in information flow between SAR authorities by adopting a system to enable an RCC receiving a distress alert to broadcast details to other RCCs, particularly those likely to have received a distress alert from the same ship via another communication system. 9.18 The Sub-Committee agreed with the United Kingdom proposal that the Inmarsat FleetNET service could provide such a broadcast facility and requested the United Kingdom to develop the idea further and submit a proposal to COMSAR 2 on procedures for the use of the Inmarsat-C services for communications between RCCs. The delegations of the Netherlands and Norway and the observer from Inmarsat offered to contribute to the submission and to submit the names and addresses of who to contact to the United Kingdom delegation. Revision of the IMOSAR and MERSAR Manuals 9.19 The Sub-Committee did not agree with a p roposal by ICS and IFSMA (COMSAR 1/9/12), to prepare guidance to masters for inclusion in the revised section 3 of the MERSAR Manual on the procedure to be followed by ships receiving a distress alert and failing to proceed to the assistance of persons in distress when it is unreasonable to expect them to do so. However, the Sub-Committee agreed that there is a need to prepare some guidance for masters on the subject in accordance with resolution 8 of the 1995 SOLAS Conference. Members were invited to consider the matter and submit comments and proposals thereon for consideration at COMSAR 2. Other SAR matters 9.20 The Sub-Committee noted information provided by Norway (COMSAR 1/INF.10) on guidelines it is preparing for co-operation between ships and the Norwegian SAR service in case of accidents at sea and, as an example, COMSAR 1/INF.11 on the Guidelines for co-operation between the Norwegian SAR service and I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 23 -  COMSAR 1/30  oil companies in case of accidents and hazardous situations in the petroleum activity within the Norwegian Search and Rescue Region (SRR) was presented. Members were invited to consider the guidelines when circulated and to submit comments and proposals thereon with the intention to standardize the format for jointly developed SAR plans. 10 COMPLETION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SAR PLAN  10.1 The Sub-Committee noted information provided by the Secretariat (COMSAR 1/9/3) on the successful outcome of the Mediterranean Sea seminar and workshop held by the Organization in Toulon (France) from 4 to 8 September 1995 in which a draft proposed provisional SAR plan for the Mediterranean Sea was prepared for further review by the countries in the region. The delegations of Malta and Turkey reserved their position with respect to the report of the Toulon seminar and workshop. 10.2 The delegation of Tunisia sta ted that the delimitation of areas of responsibility for search and rescue can only be undertaken with the participation of all the States concerned in the area and that the resolution adopted by the seminar and workshop which is annexed to COMSAR 1/9/3 cannot be considered as having any antecedence in delimiting those areas of responsibility (the full statement of Tunisia is given at annex 9). 10.3 The Sub-Committee also noted information provided by the Secretariat (COMSAR 1/9/4) on the technical co-operation programme it has implemented in response to resolution 8 of the 1979 SAR Conference and noted with appreciation the activities which have been completed and others that are planned in the near future to complete the global SAR plan. 10.4 The Sub-Committee considered a joint submission by IFSMA, ICS and ICFTU (COMSAR 1/9/11) in which they invited the Sub-Committee to: .1 .2 .3 .4 review the current situation in the Black Sea region and consider the actions now required to provide and co-ordinate efficient SAR services in the region; seek early determination on the Black Sea SRRs and the development of formal agreements for co-operation in maritime SAR; encourage the closest practicable co-ordination between maritime and aeronautical SAR services and between neighbouring States; and recommend that a regional Conference on Maritime SAR should be held as soon as possible in order to agree a provisional maritime SAR Plan for the whole of the Black Sea region without further delay.  10.5 The delegation of Turkey offered to initiate discussion with other countries bordering the Black Sea and if the discussions are fruitful to host a Conference of Black Sea countries to adopt a provisional SAR plan for the area. In the opinion of Turkey the Black Sea region should be given priority over the Mediterranean Sea in the development and adoption of a provisional maritime SAR plan because it believed that a number of matters still need to be resolved in the Mediterranean region. 10.6 The Sub-Committee urged the S ecretary-General to continue his efforts to secure funds for regional SAR meetings and for SAR training. 10.7 The Sub-Committee, noting that work on the International SAR Plan is an ongoing matter, invited the Committee to include this item in its work programme, as a ""Continuous"" item. 11 RESCUE OPERATIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT INSIDE WRECKS  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 24 -  The Sub-Committee recalled that the agenda item was added to its work programme as a result of an accident in which some crew members were trapped inside a capsized tug. There was general agreement that little guidance is available on rescue operations inside capsized wrecks. Members were invited to consider the matter and submit proposals thereon for consideration at COMSAR 2. The Committee was requested to extend the target completion date of this item in the Sub-Committee's work programme to 1997. 12 SAR TRAINING  12.1 The Sub-Committee noted that JWG 3 in considering SAR personnel, staffing and training (COMSAR 1/9/9, paragraph 8.1), had requested for copies of the IMO model courses on SAR training and being informed that the Group intended to revise the courses on the basis of its work on combining the ICAOSAR and IMOSAR Manuals, invited the Committee to delete this item from its work programme and to add to the sub-item ""harmonization of aeronautical and maritime search and rescue procedures"" the words ""including, SAR training matters"". 12.2 The delegation of Ghana supported by the delegation of Liberia appealed for assistance from countries with developed SAR organizations for the training of all categories of their SAR personnel. 12.3 The Sub-Committee, noting that resolution 8 of the 1979 SAR Conference on promotion of technical assistance, urges States to promote, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Organization, support for States requesting technical assistance for training of personnel necessary for SAR and for the provision of the equipment and facilities necessary for SAR, urged Member Governments which are in a position to assist, to do so in consultation with the Organization. 13 RO-RO FERRY SAFETY  Co-ordination of the MERSAR Manual and the Guide to Helicopter/Ship Operations 13.1 The Sub-Committee noted that the Committee at its sixty-fifth session in considering ro-ro ferry safety instructed the Sub-Committee to: .1 give consideration, in co-operation with the NAV Sub-Committee, to recommending an upper limit on the number of passengers that ro-ro passenger ships are permitted to carry, taking into account the capacity of rescue services in the ship's area of operation (MSC 65/25, paragraph 4.34); consider the co-ordination of the MERSAR Manual and the guide to Helicopter/Ship Operations (MSC 65/25, paragraph 4.40.6); and consider the future work on SAR matters and the SAR Convention (MSC 65/25, paragraph 4.40.7).  .2 .3  The Sub-Committee agreed to consider the items in paragraphs 13.1.2 and 13.1.3 and invited Members to submit comments and proposals thereon for consideration at COMSAR 2. 13.2 The Sub-Committee noted that, with regard to paragraph 13.1.1, NAV 41 (NAV 41/23, paragraphs 22.5 and 22.6) had agreed that there was no navigational reason to limit the number of passengers on ro-ro passenger ships and that this was a matter for consideration by the COMSAR Sub -Committee. The opinion was also expressed that the number of merchant ships in the area in which SAR operation involving a ro-ro passenger ship casualty took place was as important as the availability of dedicated SAR resources.  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 25 -  COMSAR 1/30  13.3 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that the number of passengers on ro-ro passenger ships is adequately regulated by the SOLAS Convention and should not depend on the capacity of the rescue services. The Sub-Committee observed that the response of a rescue service to an incident is greatly affected by circumstances which can neither be foreseen nor controlled. 13.4 The Sub-Committee further considered the proposed amendments to the SAR Convention annexed to the report of the Intersessional Working Group (COMSAR 1/13/1) and prepared the preliminary draft text, given in annex 7 to COMSAR 1/WP.7, for further consideration at COMSAR 2. 13.5 In considering the proposal by the United States (COMSAR 1/13) for a comprehensive review of the 1979 SAR Convention, the Sub-Committee noted that the same proposal has been sent by the United States to the Committee. The Sub-Committee agreed that some of the proposals by the United States might remove the difficulties presently encountered by Governments in ratifying the Convention and expressed its support for the views expressed. The Sub-Committee invited the Committee to approve a comprehensive review of the SAR Convention and, noting that the work cannot be done during a normal Sub-Committee meeting, requested the Committee to approve an intersessional meeting of the SAR Working Group for this purpose. 13.6 The proposal by Germany (COMSAR 1/13/2) was supported by the Sub-Committee for inclusion in the draft amendments. 14 PERFORMAN STANDARDS FOR SHIPBORNE RADIO EQUIPMENT CE  Review of GMDSS equipment performance 14.1 The Sub-Committee recalled that in order to avoid false distress alerts while still keeping a simple procedure for generating alerts in a distress situation, taking into account the human element, a standardized procedure for transmission of distress alerts and messages for GMDSS equipment was prepared by COM 40 and included by the Secretariat, in accordance with the Sub -Committee's instructions, in the draft Assembly resolutions submitted to MSC 65 for approval and submission to the ninteenth Assembly for adoption. A list of resolutions relating to performance standards for GMDSS equipment adopted by the ninteenth Assembly is given in COMSAR 1/2/2. 14.2 It was noted that a new operative paragraph was included in all resolutions concerning performance standards for GMDSS equipment adopted by the ninteenth Assembly requesting the Maritime Safety Committee to keep the resolutions under review and to adopt amendments thereto, as necessary. 14.3 It was also noted that by resolution A.825(19) - Procedure for adoption and amendment of performance standards for radio and navigational equipment, the ninteenth Assembly decided that the function of adopting performance standards for radio and navigational equipment, as well as amendments thereto, shall by performed by the MSC on behalf of the Organization. 14.4 The Sub-Committee agreed to the opinion expressed by the Technical Working Group (COMSAR 1/14, paragraph 2.6) that there is a need to prepare performance standards for power supply arrangements. 14.5 Considering COMSAR 1/14/2, COMSAR 1/14/3 and COMSAR 1/14/4 (Norway and Sweden) regarding performance standards for shipborne radio reserve sources of energy, the Sub-Committee decided, due to lack of time, to give further consideration to this matter at COMSAR 2. 14.6 The Sub-Committee noted that: .1 NAV 41 (NAV 41/23, paragraph 6.62) had considered the proposal by Germany (NAV 41/6/18) on a common structure for perf ormance standards for navigational  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 26 -  equipment. There was support in principle for this approach and the concept of issuing performance standards as a ring binder publication. However, the NAV Sub -Committee concluded that there was a need for further consideration of the detail to ensure alignment with other requirements found in SOLAS, IEC and ISO standards; and .2 NAV 41 (NAV 41/23, paragraph 6.63) was of the opinion that the common structure had to be approved by itself rather than issued as an Assembly resolution. This would provide flexibility for the future when changing requirements allowing the basis of the common structure to be used as guidelines and invited the COMSAR Sub-Committee to also consider adopting the same common structure for its performance standards.  14.7 The Sub-Committee considered the use of a general, harmonized format of performance standards and was of the opinion that the format of the present standards is already harmonized as far as is practical. The Sub-Committee also was of the opinion that too strict rules for the format would limit the necessary flexibility in the contents of the performance standards. 14.8 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that some of the performance standards need updating. Members were invited to submit comments and proposals on this matter to COMSAR 2 for consideration. 14.9 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/14/1 (United States) and COMSAR 1/INF.4 (Inmarsat) regarding the use of Inmarsat-M terminals on board SOLAS ships and concurred with the opinion that Inmarsat-M SESs at the present do not fulfil the requirements of the GMDSS, as currently the terminals do not provide direct-printing communications; the priority arrangement for distress calls via the Inmarsat -M system ends at the CES and, in common with other automatic systems, there is no priority call arrangement from shore-to-ship. 14.10 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that the term ""Direct-Printing"" should not be taken to only mean telex, but that general data communications could be regarded as equivalent. 14.11 It was pointed out that the priority routeing all the way to the relevant RCC should be assured, and national arrangements may have to be taken into account. 14.12 The Sub-Committee invited Inmarsat to develop suitable means for introducing data transmission capability for distress communications in Inmarsat-M SESs and to supply further information on the arrangements in the Inmarsat-M system for priority calls. 14.13 As there is a need for preparing performance standa rds for Inmarsat-M terminals for general communications not being part of the GMDSS, Members were invited to submit comments and proposals thereon to COMSAR 2 for consideration. Ro-ro ferry safety - Performance standards for VHF/UHF portable radiotelephones 14.14 The Sub-Committee noted that MSC 65 (MSC 65/25, paragraph 4.40.5) had agreed that the COMSAR Sub-Committee should consider performance standards for VHF/UHF portable radiotelephones. 14.15 The Sub-Committee noted that, if both VHF and UHF portab le radiotelephone apparatus are used for on-scene communications, there may be situations where units in the rescue operations cannot communicate with each other. Therefore, the Sub-Committee was of the opinion that such VHF and UHF apparatus should not be combined into the same equipment, as the equipment would be unduly complicated and the introduction of more than one on -scene frequency would lead to confusion for inexperienced persons. The Sub-Committee strongly recommended that only one frequency should be used for on -scene communications. However, when UHF equipment is being used for on-board communications, it should be clearly I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 27 -  COMSAR 1/30  distinguishable from the GMDSS VHF portable radiotelephone apparatus (e.g. by use of different colours). 14.16 The Sub-Committee also noted that the 1995 SOLAS Conference, among others, had adopted the amendments to chapter IV as new regulation 7.5: ""Every passenger ship shall be provided with means for two-way on-scene radiocommunications for search and rescue purposes using the aeronautical frequencies 121.5 MHz and 123.1 MHz from the position from which the ship is normally navigated."" 14.17 With regard to these amendments, the Sub-Committee was of the opinion that performance standards for equipment using frequencies 121.5 MHz and 123.1 MHz should be developed. Members were invited to submit comments and proposals on this matter to COMSAR 2 for consideration. 14.18 It was pointed out that, if portable on -scene communication equipment operating on the aeronautical distress frequencies 121.5 MHz and 123.1 MHz is being used, it should be frequently checked, especially with regard to battery status because this equipment will not be in daily use as on -board communication equipment. Technical Working Group 14.19 The Sub-Committee instructed the Technical Working Group to consider a number of documents submitted under agenda items 7, 8.3, 15, 16, 24 and all documents submitted under agenda item 14. The outcome of the Working Group's discussions related to these documents and not included in this report will be circulated under the appropriate agenda item to COMSAR 2. Members were invited to consider the report of the Group, when circulated, and to submit comments and proposals thereon for consideration by the SubCommittee. 15 RADIOCOMMUNICATION ITU-R STUDY GROUP 8 MATTERS  15.1 The Sub-Committee noted that no documents had been submitted under this agenda item for consideration. However, in considering other submissions, the Sub-Committee made a number of decisions concerning ITU-R Study Group 8 which are reflected in paragraphs 4.1, 4.6, 4.8, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.28 of this report. 15.2 Members were invited to submit comments and proposals relating to ITU-R Study Group 8 matters to COMSAR 2 for consideration. 16 DEVELOPMENT OF MEASURES COMPLEMENTARY TO THE INF CODE  16.1 The Sub-Committee recalled that COM 40 (COM 40/22, paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4) had agreed to consider technically feasible solutions for devices which would facilitate the location and detection of an INF carrying ship or its cargo which was floating or had sunk and gave preliminary consideration to the devices which might be used and the information it would require to develop performance standards for such locating and detection devices for further consideration at COMSAR 1. 16.2 The Sub-Committee noted that the ninteenth Assembly had adopted resolution A.790(19) on Review of the Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships. 16.3 The Sub-Committee considered the problem described in COM 40/16 (Solomon Islands) regarding the location of containers with radioactive contents and recognized that while a floating container could easily be located after sending out signals using existing radio systems, such systems could not be used for location I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 28 -  if a container has sunk in water. For location under water, due to power supply limitations, only on acoustic means would seem to be practicable and the transmission of such locating signals could be based on transponder principles. 16.4 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that the ship carrying INF materials and perhaps each separate container of INF, could be continuously position -updated, and set off an alarm when containers are lost overboard. Individual containers, which are lost overboard, could be located if provided with an acoustic transponder or other suitable means. 16.5 The United Kingdom informed the Sub-Committee that at least one ship for carrying INF materials, known to them, has a facility to transmit an acoustic signal to enable the ship to be located in depths up to 6000 m, should it sink. The United Kingdom also informed the Sub-Committee, when steaming normally, the ship periodically reports its position via the Inmarsat system to the operator. 16.6 The Sub-Committee instructed the Secretariat to bring paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4 to the attention of the Special Consultative Meeting on Entities Involved in the Carriage of Material subject to the INF Code, which will be held from 4 to 6 March 1996 at the Headquarters of IMO, for information and to NAV 42 for consideration. 16.7 The Committee was invited to note the Sub-Committee's opinion regarding location of INF containers, given in paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4, and that these paragraphs have also been brought to the attention of NAV 42, for consideration. 16.8 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that work on this matter has been completed and invited the Committee to delete this item from the Sub-Committee's work programme. 17 TRANSMISSION OF UPDATING INFORMATION FOR ELECTRONIC NAVIGATIONAL CHARTS  17.1 The Sub-Committee noted that the 19th Assembly had adopted resolution A.817(19) on Performance standards for ECDIS. 17.2 The Sub-Committee also noted that Recommendati on ITU-R M.826, on transmission of information for updating ECDIS, recommends the use of a forward error detecting and correcting code for information transmitted in the Inmarsat system. 17.3 The Sub-Committee, noting that NAV 41 had been informed of the results of trials of ECDIS (NAV 41/INF.13) which had been held over a certain period of time in order to prove the efficiency of the updating methods and the feasibility of automatic updating ECDIS on board ships, using the IHO S -57 transfer standard and radiocommunication channels, had proven successful, was of the opinion that the work on this matter has been completed and invited the Committee to delete this item from the Sub -Committee's work programme. 18 ITU WORLD RADIOCOMMUNICATION CONFERENCE MATTERS  18.1 The Sub-Committee noted a report, submitted by the Secretariat (COMSAR 1/18), on the outcome of the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95) which was held in Geneva from 23 October to 17 November 1995 and its Resolutions and Recommendations relating to the Sub -Committee's work. The SubCommittee's comments on various matters are given in the following paragraphs. 18.2 With regard to Resolution GT PLEN-3 [718] - Agenda for the 1997 WRC, the Sub-Committee noted with satisfaction those matters related to the maritime mobile service and maritime mobile satellite service I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 29 -  COMSAR 1/30  which had been included in the agenda under item 1.6, and that these reflected the position of the Organization as given in its submission to WRC-95. 18.3 The Sub-Committee reiterated its position to have the provisions of the Radio Regulations concerning the maritime mobile services considered by WRC-97 as a matter of urgency, taking into account in particular that the date for full implementation of the GMDSS (1 February 1999) will be prior to WRC-99, and the importance of all the matters under item 1.6 of the WRC-97 agenda. The Committee was requested to approve this position and instruct the Secretariat to communicate it to the ITU before the ITU Council meeting beginning 19 June 1996. 18.4 The ITU observer informed the Sub-Committee of the work of the ITU Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM) which will include in its report to WRC-97 a chapter on the maritime and aeronautical services. 18.5 With regard to resolution GT PLEN-4 [719] - Urgent studies required in preparation for WRC -97, the Sub-Committee noted that maritime related matters have been included under the list of items identified for urgent study in preparation for WRC-97. Attention was also drawn to Resolution COM 5-9[715] which should complement the list of the WRC-95 decisions that COMSAR 1/18 had identified as being of interest to the Organization. 18.6 The Sub-Committee noted that, in Resolution GT PLEN-5 [720], the review of the channel arrangements in the HF bands for the maritime mobile service, taking into account the use of new digital technology, had been included in the provisional agenda for WRC-99. 18.7 With regard to Resolution COM 4-3 [711], the Sub-Committee noted that furt her studies concerning the application of Article S19 (identification of stations) was needed and that the Organization should contribute to this work. Members were invited to consider this matter and to submit comments and proposals thereon to COMSAR 2. 18.8 The Sub-Committee noted Resolution COM 4-7 [339] on co-ordination of NAVTEX services and was of the opinion that the NAVTEX co-ordination panel could undertake the task of co-ordination of the NAVTEX services. The Sub-Committee further agreed that the response to the ITU should record the need to establish an effective means of information exchange on the use of the NAVTEX frequencies and any adjacent frequencies which would have to be considered in the co-ordination of additional or amended NAVTEX services. The Sub-Committee noted that the possibility of interference with aeronautical beacons may require the continued involvement of the ITU. 18.9 Resolution COM 4-8 [713] - Consideration of certain operational matters concerning the radio regulations in the aeronautical and maritime mobile services, instructs the Secretary -General of the ITU to arrange for appropriate studies within ITU, in consultation with ICAO and IMO, in order to identify provisions in the Radio Regulations, particularly with respect to chapters SVIII and SIX, which specify operational procedures affecting only aeronautical mobile and maritime mobile services. The Sub-Committee considered the implications of this Resolution by which WRC-95, among other things, proposed to study the legal foundations of the ITU, IMO and ICAO. The intention was to gain a better understanding of how regulatory provisions are established within the three organisations and the consequent scope of their application. Following discussion, the Sub -Committee agreed that while there were undoubtedly a number of legal and practical problems involved in effecting an eventual transfer, there could be some advantages if handled properly. The treatment of commercial procedures and those ships not covered by present IMO regulations would present a considerable challenge. 18.10 The Sub-Committee agreed to the Chairman's proposal that he would conduct an informal study with the Chairman of ITU-R Working Party 8B, and other experts to study the practical aspects and to determine I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 30 -  what would be the critical questions to address, noting that the Radio Regulations cover all types of radiocommunications for all ships, not only for distress and safety but also commercial communications. The Chairman undertook to prepare a paper for consideration at COMSAR 2 on the outcome of this work. 18.11 The Sub-Committee noted that Recommendation COM 4-A [34] on principles for the allocation of frequency bands had been developed bearing in mind the reservations expressed at MSC 65 concerning the ITU Voluntary Group of Experts proposals to reduce, by merging, the number of radiocommunication services. The effect of the Recommendation is that safety factors should be considered when merger proposals are studied and that the Organization should be consulted when maritime matters are involved. 18.12 All Administrations are invited to note the WRC-97 agenda, submit comments to COMSAR 2 and advise their telecommunications administrations of specific proposals for the Conference and the CPM-97, which will be held in May 1997. Maintenance of watch on VHF channel 16 after 1 February 1999 18.13 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/18/1 and COMSAR 1/18/2 (France), COMSAR 1/4/2 and COMSAR 1/7/2 (Australia) concerning various aspects of maintaining an audio watch on VHF Channel 16 beyond the GMDSS implementation date of 1 February 1999. The majority opinion in the Sub-Committee was that it would not be practical to discontinue the audio watch from that date because of the vast numbers of smaller ships, not subject to SOLAS requirements, which could not be brought within the GMDSS by 1999. It was recognized that 90% of ships are not subject to IMO Conventions and that 90% of SAR incidents involved non-Convention ships, mainly close to the shore. 18.14 Although the Sub-Committee recognized that Channel 16 working as at present would have to be retained for some time after 1999 there was strong agreement that there would eventually have to be one system, the GMDSS. Some delegations expressed concern that relaxation of the ending of Channel 16 watchkeeping would discourage the fitting of GMDSS equipment on non -Convention ships; as a consequence, Convention ships would also have to maintain Channel 16 watchkeeping, otherwise there would be no common system between Convention and non-Convention ships. 18.15 The Sub-Committee agreed that the proposal by Australia in COMSAR 1/4/2 to limit the exemption on fitting the VHF DSC equipment available under SOLAS chapter IV would assist in reducing the problems in extending Channel 16 watchkeeping beyond 1999. The proposed cut-off date of 2001 was not accepted, being too long for some delegations and too short for others. The Sub -Committee agreed to give further consideration to this proposal at COMSAR 2 when the state of progress on GMDSS equipment installations on non-Convention ships would be clearer. 18.16 The Sub-Committee noted that MSC/Circ.469 provides guidance on fitting GMDSS equipment to non-Convention ships and that it may be necessary to return to this issue at COMSAR 2. Interference to HF distress and safety communications 18.17 The Sub-Committee, when considering COMSAR 1/7/2 (Australia), again expressed concern at the harmful interference being caused on HF simplex distress and safety frequencies in the GMDSS. 18.18 For the simplex R/T distress and safety frequencies 12290 kHz and 16240 because these may also be used legitimately as the ship transmits frequencies of channels 1221 and 1621. The Sub-Committee agreed that the continued use of the and 16420 kHz for other than distress and safety purposes could seriously affect 18.19 kHz the problem arises duplex radiotelephone frequencies 12290 kHz GMDSS communications.  The Sub-Committee, having reviewed COM/Circ.119, prepared COMSAR/Circ.6 c ontaining a  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 31 -  COMSAR 1/30  recommendation on prevention of harmful interference on the 8, 12 and 16 MHz GMDSS distress and safety simplex frequencies and instructed the Secretariat to bring it, as a matter of urgency, to the attention of Member Governments, ITU telecommunication Administrations and mariners. The Committee was invited to endorse this action. 19 REVIEW OF RESOLUTIONS A.534(13) ON THE CODE OF SAFETY FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE SHIPS AND A.686(17) ON THE CODE ON ALARMS AND INDICATORS, AS AMENDED  Code of Safety for special purpose ships (SPS) 19.1 The Sub-Committee noted that DE 39 had endorsed the COM Sub-Committee's suggested amendments to chapters 8 and 9 of the SPS Code and its proposals for the SPS safety certificate to be amended and supplemented by a record of equipment similar to that appearing in the SOLAS Convention and had prepared an MSC circular containing the amendments for approval by MSC 66 (DE 39/31, annex 20). Code on alarms and indicators 19.2 The Sub-Committee noted that DE 38 had considered COM 40/18 (Germany) and, taking into account the COM Sub-Committee's comments, prepared a draft Assembly resolution on revised Code on alarms and indicators which was adopted by the nineteenth Assembly as resolution A.830(19). 19.3 The Sub-Committee, noting that work on this item was completed, invited the Committee to delete it from the Sub-Committee's work programme. 20 SATELLITE SERVICES  COSPAS-SARSAT SERVICES 20.1 The Sub-Committee noted informatio n (COMSAR 1/20/2) on the status of the COSPAS -SARSAT programme, in particular: .1 29 LUTs are in operation in 17 countries. 4 more are under test and additional LUTs are planned in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Iran and Saudi Arabia. 14 MCCs are in operation and 4 are being tested; more than 100,000 406 MHz beacons are in service and the number is expected to double by the year 2000; during 1994 COSPAS-SARSAT provided assistance in 297 SAR events which resulted in the rescue of 998 persons; non distress activations of 406 MHz beacons continues to be a matter of concern but the recent introduction of a two-step activation process seems to be reducing the number of inadvertent activations; the number of unregistered 406 MHz beacons continues to be a problem; the initial test results of the 406 MHz GEOSAR system which is under development and evaluation will be considered by COSPAS-SARSAT in 1996; specifications for 406 MHz beacons and LUTs have been amended to provide for opt ionally  .2 .3 .4  .5 .6 .7  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 32 -  encoded position information in the transmitted message. Details of the amendments have been sent to IMO, in accordance with resolution A.810(19); and .8 a COSPAS-SARSAT seminar will be held in London from 23 to 25 October 1996 to provide information on the many developments taking place in the system.  INMARSAT SERVICES Inmarsat service activation of SESs 20.2 Inmarsat (COMSAR 1/20) informed the Sub-Committee that: .1 it is important that national administrations and maritime authorities ensure that SES operators under their flag understand that, beginning 1 April 1996, it is incumbent upon them to test the operation of distress alerting and calling capabilities on their Inmarsat-B, C and M SES installations; they will not be tested automatically or by prearrangement during service activation. This testing of distress alerting and calling capabilities will be available at no charge; and it is important that national administrations, maritime authorities, licensing authorities and routeing organizations (RO) understand the limitations of the Inmarsat service provider concept, planned for implementation in September 1996, and ensure that applications for service activation of SESs which may at any time be needed to provide distress and safety communications be processed within the Accounting Authority framework. Inmarsat will check application forms and reject the service provider option except where the use of the SES is for commercial purposes only.  .2  20.3 The Sub-Committee expressed concern at the discontinuation of commissioning tests which will no longer be carried out automatically or by prearrangement during service activation for Inmarsat-B, C and M SES installations to ensure that SESs for the GMDSS have been installed and are operating properly. This will place an extra burden on maritime Administrations since they would still have to ensure that the SES is properly tested, especially with regard to distress and safety, before issuing the relevant safety certificate. 20.4 The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that, with respect to ships which voluntarily fit SESs, if the equipment has not been tested, it will be uncertain whether it will work satisfactorily should it be necessary for the ship to conduct distress or safety communications. There is also a danger that if the tests are carried out by an unskilled person, a false distress alert could be transmitted. 20.5 With regard to the service provider concept, the Sub-Committee was of the opinion that this concept should not be applied to maritime SESs regardless of whether they are subject to GMDSS requirements or not and that a special application form should be used by Inmarsat for maritime SESs in order to ensure that the service provider option is rejected. Barring of SESs 20.6 The Sub-Committee considered COMSAR 1/20/1 (Inmarsat) advising Administrations of the barring procedures employed by Inmarsat when ships do not pay their bills. The Sub-Committee noted that: .1 .2 there will continue to be cases where debts are not paid on time whereby SESs will be subject to barring; the barring of SESs can adversely affect ship's radio licenses, the availability of communications for distress and safety purposes and GMDSS certification; and  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 33 -  COMSAR 1/30  .3  the assistance of Administrations in ensuring payment of bills, in accordance with Recommendation ITU-T D.90, will help to ensure that ships are not barred from using their SESs and thus deprived of safety communications and GMDSS certification.  20.7  The Sub-Committee expressed grave concern at: .1 the barring procedures affecting the ships' distress and safety communications, taking into account the Inmarsat explanation of the Inmarsat observer that distress priority 3 calls could still be transmitted by the barred SES, but that follow up distress and safety communications in both shore-to-ship and ship-to-shore directions would not immediately be possible; and the possibility of barring ships while at sea, thus seriously impeding their ability to conduct distress and safety communications in accordance with the requirement of SOLAS chapter IV.  .2  20.8 With regard to the barring procedures, the Sub-Committee was very firmly of the opinion that Inmarsat should ensure that the master of the ship, the operator of the SES and the ship's flag Administration must be notified at least thirty days before the actual barring takes place in order for appropriate measures to be taken by the shipowner to prevent the ship's safety certificate being rendered invalid whereby the ship would be prevented from sailing from its next port. 20.9 The ICFTU, noting that Inmarsat would have recourse to lien that once barred the ship would be unseaworthy and that seafarers' lives could be put at risk for reasons beyond their own control, expressed special concern at barring at sea. 20.10 The Secretariat was instructed to brin g paragraphs 20.2 to 20.9 to the urgent attention of Inmarsat for appropriate action. Inmarsat-M telephony trials 20.11 The Sub-Committee noted a report on Inmarsat-M telephony trials (COMSAR 1/INF.4) on the possible use of Inmarsat-M in the GMDSS which generally concluded that, based on the subjective results of an Inmarsat-M maritime telephony trials programme and on the results of a separate series of objective field measurements of Inmarsat-M service field strengths at high Northern latitudes, for latitudes up to 75 North the call success rate and intelligibility of the Inmarsat-M telephony service is very similar to that currently being provided within the service area at satellite elevation angles above . 15-20 ITU Recommendation E.164 Country Code ""870"" to Inmarsat 20.12 The Sub-Committee noted a liaison statement from ITU-T Study Group 2 (COMSAR 1/INF.5) on assignment of Recommendation E.164 Country Code ""870"" to Inmarsat for Single Network Access Code (SNAC) operations which effectively would restrict direct dialling of ships fitted with Inmarsat-A SESs beyond the year 2015. Institutional changes in Inmarsat 20.13 The Sub-Committee noted with satisfaction the concern expressed by the Committee (MSC 65/25), paragraphs 7.34 to 7.42 and annex 24) at the possible impact and consequences of the proposed institutional changes being contemplated by Inmarsat and the action taken by the Committee to ensure that the interests of the Organization with regard to future maritime distress, safety and general communication services are upheld. I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 34 -  20.14 The Sub-Committee noted information provided by Inmarsat relating to GMDSS comm unication services operated via Inmarsat systems for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 September 1995 and in particular that: .1 at the end of October 1995, there were almost 18000 Inmarsat-A and 13000 Inmarsat -C terminals fitted in ships. In addition, 487 Inmarsat-B terminals and 136 Inmarsat -E EPIRBs were in use at sea; network operation availability ranged from 99.74% to 100% over the ocean regions, averaging 99.85%. Space segment availability was maintained at 100%, whilst the average availability of the network co-ordination stations was 99.99% for Inmarsat -A, 99.94% for Inmarsat-C and 99.98% for Inmarsat-B; and the Inmarsat Distress Alert Quality Control System (DAQCS) maintains a database of all data available from Investigations of real and false distress alerts. This shows that, for the 9 months of 1995 covered by the report and not counting authorised tests, there were 51 genuine and 429 improper distress priority uses of Inmarsat systems (preliminary figures). Inmarsat continues to follow-up all uses of distress priority with the ship concerned, providing advice on how to avoid improper use of distress priority.  .2  .3  21  INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS  21.1 The Sub-Committee, noting that no documents had been submitted on this item and that NAV 41 had deferred consideration of possible amendments to chapter XIV of the Code to NAV 42, invited Members to submit any comments and proposals directly to NAV 42. 21.2 The Sub-Committee, noting also that amendments to the International Code of Si gnals might require consideration at COMSAR 2, invited the Committee to retain this agenda item in the SubCommittee's work programme until COMSAR 2, when if no submission has been received the SubCommittee will recommend its deletion from the Sub-Committee's work programme. 22 REVIEW OF RESOLUTION A.703(17) ON TRAINING OF RADIO PERSONNEL IN THE GMDSS  22.1 The Sub-Committee recalled that STW 27 had noted the draft revised amendments to chapter IV of the STCW Convention and Parts A and B of the STCW Code, prepared by COM 40 (STW 27/3/32), and endorsed and amended the texts for inclusion in the draft amendments to the STCW Convention. 22.2 The Sub-Committee noted that, in respect of regulation I/4, paragraph 1.3, STW 27 had decided not to include as a reason, under control procedures for assessment of the ability of the seafarers of a ship, that ""the ship has emitted false distress alerts which have not been followed by correct cancellation procedures"". Such control provisions should be included in an appropriate part of resolution A.742(18) - Procedures for the control of operational requirements related to the safety of ships and pollution prevention. 22.3 The Sub-Committee noted that the World Radiocommunication Conference, 1995 (WRC-95), considering the simplification of the Radio Regulations, had clarified the application of the Restricted Operator's Certificate (ROC) by insertion of the following Note 1 to Table 1 in Article S47 to the Final Acts of WRC-95: ""Note 1: A restricted operator's certificate covers only the operation of GMDSS equipment required for GMDSS sea areas A1, and does not cover the operation of GMDSS A2/A3/A4 equipment fitted I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 35 -  COMSAR 1/30  on a ship over and above the basic A1 requirements, even if the ship is in a sea area A1. GMDSS sea areas A1, A2, A3 and A4 are identified in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended."" 22.4 The United States (COMSAR 1/22) proposed to outline alternatives for developing suitable training materials for voluntary use by operators of GMDSS equipment on board ships not subject to IMO Conventions. These materials may be developed separately for each individual GMDSS sub-system, and if generally made available to the boating public, could reduce the misuse of GMDSS sub-systems and could prepare such operators to use the GMDSS elements when they are in distress. 22.5 The Sub-Committee, concurring in principle with the United States proposal, was of the opinion that the proposed guidance should be included in a revision of MSC/Circ.469 as a recommendation on development of training materials for GMDSS operators on non-convention ships and, using the annex to COMSAR 1/22 as above, prepared for further consideration at COMSAR 2 the provisional draft MSC circular on participation of non-convention ships in the GMDSS, given in COMSAR 1/WP.5. 22.6 Members were invited to consider the provisional draft MSC circular and to submit comments and proposals thereon to enable the Sub -Committee to complete its consideration of the MSC circular at COMSAR 2. The Committee was invited to extend the target completion date of this item to 1997. 22.7 The Sub-Committee was informed by Mr. J. Shaw (United Kingdom and CEPT), Chairman of the Validation Group on GMDSS Model Training Courses, that: .1 at STW 27 (6-10 February 1995) the brief of the voluntary group of experts working on the model training course for the GMDSS General Operator's Certificate was extended to cover the production of comprehensive course notes for students; the Norwegian Foreign Ministry provided NOK 200,000 to fund this work which has mainly been spent on the services of a GMDSS consultant. The Norwegian telecommunications operator TELENOR A/S also provided assistance by providing staff time and computer equipment. Thanks should also be extended to the assistance of Wray Castle College, United Kingdom in the preparation of the course notes; the consultant's report was delivered in January 1996 and is now under review. The model course itself is essentially complete and is the standard format as required by the Organization; some more work is needed on all course notes to bring in examples of distress and safety communications from outside the European area, and to expand on some of the technical aspects; the remaining work will be carried out by the Group members and the remaining funds will be conserved so that the consultant can participate in the formal presentations of the course; and the intention is to complete th e additional work required by April so that formal evaluation can be carried out at STW 28 (16 to 20 September 1996).  .2  .3  .4  .5  .6  22.8 The Sub-Committee noted the report of the Chairman of the Validation Group and expressed its appreciation for the assistance given by all concerned with preparation and validation of the model training courses.  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 36 -  23  STANDARD MARINE COMMUNICATION PHRASES  23.1 The Sub-Committee, noting that NAV 42 would consider the Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) prepared by its Correspondence Group, invited Members to consider the report of the Group when circulated to NAV 42 and to submit any comments and proposals directly to NAV 42. 23.2 The Sub-Committee invited the Committee to retain this item in its work programme, for the time being, so that it can consider those parts of the SMCP related to GMDSS radiocommunications and SAR and proposed a target completion date of 1997. 24 ROLE OF THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN MARITIME CASUALTIES  24.1 The Sub-Committee instructed all working groups and d rafting groups, in the context of the human element, to take account of the Committee's instructions (MSC 65/25/Add.2, annex 29), in their work and to identify in their reports relevant matters where consideration of the human element takes place. 24.2 In this regard, the Sub-Committee considered and took account of the human element in the matters listed under agenda items 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22 and 24. The results of these considerations are reflected under corresponding sections of this report. Guidelines for the on-board use and application of computers 24.3 The Sub-Committee noted COMSAR 1/24 (IEC) and DE 39/30/2 (IEC) and considered COMSAR 1/14, paragraph 2.8 (Technical Working Group), related to the general use of computers on board ships and agreed that distress and safety operating software should be required to be stored in non -corruptible memories and without the use of a switch to disconnect remote operating controls, as a software switch would be sensitive to virus infections and a hardware switch could easily be forgotten and left in the wrong position in a distress situation. It was also agreed that means should be provided to automatically monitor the operational software of the equipment at appropriate time intervals. 24.4 The Sub-Committee recommended the application of these requirements to the software used with all shipborne computer type equipment used for navigation and radiocommunications and was of the opinion that these requirements should also be applicable to other shipborne computer equipment. 24.5 The Sub-Committee instructed the Secretariat to bring paragraphs 24.3 and 24.4 to the attention of the DE, NAV and SLF Sub-Committees for information. 24.6 The Sub-Committee, noting that work on ""Guidelines for the on-board use and application of computers"" was completed, invited the Committee to delete this sub-item from the Sub -Committee's work programme and, as work on the ""Role of the human element"" was continuously under consideration by the Sub-Committee in all its work, to amend the target completion date to ""continuous"". 25 SAFETY OF PASSENGER SUBMERSIBLE CRAFT  25.1 The Sub-Committee recalled that COM 40 had agreed that passenger submersible craft when on the surface should: .1 .2 if in autonomous operation, meet the appropriate requirements of SOLAS chapter IV for the Sea Area in which they operate; and if accompanied by a supporting surface ship (non-autonomous operation), have intercommunication with the parent ship,  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 37 -  COMSAR 1/30  and that this opinion had been brought to the attention of the DE Sub-Committee. 25.2 The Sub-Committee was informed by the Secretariat that after a general discussion on the draft guidelines (DE 39/15 and Corr.1), DE 39 agreed that considerable progress has been made but, recognizing that there are still a number of outstanding issues requiring further work, re-established the correspondence group and instructed it to compile the final draft guidelines, taking into account proposals by experts, comments of DE 39 and the outcome of SLF 40 and the COMSAR Sub-Committee on this item. 25.3 The Sub-Committee considered the sections of the guidelines for the design, construction and operation of passenger submersible craft prepared by the correspondence group (DE 39/15) which related to communications and, noting that this matter would require special knowledge, invited the Technical Working Group in consultation with the Operational Working Group to give consideration to such passenger submersible craft communications. 25.4 Taking into account that COMSAR 2 is tentatively scheduled to be held and DE 40 from 10 to 14 February 1997, the Sub-Committee invited Member experts on submersible craft communications consider the compiled text of circulated to DE 40, and to submit comments and proposals thereon to COMSAR to enable the Sub-Committee to provide advice to DE 40. from 27 to 31 January 1997 Governments to have their the draft guidelines, when 2 for consideration in order  25.5 The Sub-Committee noted the opinion expressed by Finland (COMSAR 1/25/1), which is based on fairly extensive operational experience of submersible craft operating in its national waters, that the requirements for radio equipment on passenger submersible craft should be left to the discretion of the flag State. If in the future, passenger submersibles were to embark on international voyages, the matter would have to be reconsidered. 25.6 The Sub-Committee also noted that France (COMSAR 1/25) has for several years been in the process of preparing regulations applicable to civil submarines which are due to enter into force within the next few months. The French draft regulations relate to all civil submarines or submersible craft and, in the case of passenger submarines, incorporate regulations of a more mandatory nature. 25.7 26 The Committee was invited to extend the target completion date of this item to 1997. REVIEW OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN IMO INSTRUMENTS  26.1 The Sub-Committee noted that COM 40 (COM 40/22, paragraphs 19.3 to 19.5) had recalled that it requires reports: .1 .2 .3 in response to the questionnaire on casualties (COM/Circ.70/Rev.1); on exemptions granted from the requirements of SOLAS chapter IV in accordance with SOLAS regulation IV/3.3; and on shore-based facilities for the GMDSS, in accordance with SOLAS regulation IV/5.2 for inclusion in the GMDSS Master Plan.  COM 40 was of the opinion that all the reports referred to in paragraph 19.3 of COM 40/22 are essential and should continue to be required. The Committee was invited to note this opinion and to delete this item from the Sub-Committee's work programme. 26.2 The Sub-Committee also noted that LSR 26 had noted (LSR 26/20, paragraph 18.3.1), that  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 38 -  mandatory reports with regard to SAR are requested on established SAR organizations and alterations of importance thereto, in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2 of the 1979 SAR Convention and agreements concerning search and rescue regions in accordance with paragraph 2.1.4 of the 1979 SAR Convention and that this information is needed for the development of the international SAR Plan. LSR 26 agreed that these reports are essential for the purposes of implementation of the SAR Convention and for the conduct of port State control. 26.3 In accordance with the Committee's instructions, the Sub-Committee reviewed the opinions of COM 40 and LSR 26 on the basis of the recommendation of the FSI Sub-Committee (FSI 3/17, paragraph 3.14) that when reviewing reporting requirements the Sub-Committee should take into account the following criteria: .1 .2 .3 .4 How has the collation of the information contributed to safety of life at sea or pollution prevention? Is the information requirement out of date? Is the information readily available to the provider without an undue administrative burden? How is the information used by IMO? Flag State? Port State? Other interested bodies?  .5 .6 .7  Is the information indexed and readily accessible? Is there a consistent format for reporting? What would happen if the information was not collected?  and that in the future the Sub-Committee should apply these criteria before proposing new reporting requirements. 26.4 The Sub-Committee, noting that with the exception of the questionnaire on casualties all the remaining reports are convention requirements, reaffirmed the opinions of COM 40 and LSR 26 that these mandatory reports were essential and should continue to be required. 26.5 With regard to replies to the questionnaire on casualties (COM/Circ.70/Rev.1), the opinion was expressed that the FSI Sub-Committee is responsible for evaluating casualty reports and any evidence of radiocommunication problems in these reports could, if necessary, be brought to the attention of the COMSAR Sub-Committee by the FSI Sub-Committee for action, as appropriate. 26.6 The Sub-Committee invited the FSI Sub-Committee to note that notification of aspects of casualties which demonstrate failure of, or problems with, the casualties GMDSS communications was needed and this may involve ships which are not necessarily serious casualties. If the FSI Sub -Committee could notify the Sub-Committee when such problems have occurred then replies to COM/Circ.70/Rev.1 would no longer be necessary. 26.7 With regard to the Committee's instructions (MSC 65/25, paragraph 19.3) to review the list of codes, recommendation, guidelines and other non-mandatory instruments annexed to MSC 65/19/1 so that it would, in future, contain information provided by maritime Administrations only on those instruments for which there is a need to record their status of implementation, the Sub-Committee noted that it is not responsible for I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 39 -  COMSAR 1/30  any non-mandatory instruments requiring reports or records of their status of implementation, nor is it or either the COM or LSR Sub-Committees mentioned in the list of Sub-Committees, given in the annex to MSC 65/19/1. 26.8 The Sub-Committee invited the Committee to delete this agenda item from its work programme as being completed. 27 WORK PROGRAMME  27.1 The Sub-Committee noted the Committee's instructions (MSC 65/22 /2, paragraph 11) that when considering its work programme it should: .1 .2 .2.1 .2.1.1 .2.1.2 .2.1.3 .2.1.4 .2.2 .2.3 .2.4 .3 first deal with high priority items and, if time permits, with low priority ones; and in case of low priority items, when considering their postponement: check whether: adequate submissions have been received; there is sufficient general interest to keep the item on their work programme; the instructions received are clear enough; and adequate industry standards already exist; specify the benefit expected to be derived from the implementation of any requirements which may be developed; estimate the number of sessions needed to complete work on the item concerned; and report on the questions specified in subparagraphs .2.1 to .2.3 above to the Committee for its consideration and action as appropriate; and inform the Committee(s) on items for which no submissions have been received for two consecutive sessions, which should, therefore, be deleted unless an adequate reasoning to retain the items in the work programme is provided by the Sub-Committee.  27.2 Taking into account the progress made during the session and the instructions of the Committee, the Sub-Committee reviewed and prepared the draft revised Work Programme, given in annex 11 for consideration and approval by the Committee. 28 ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN AND VICE-CHAIRMAN FOR 1997  In accordance with rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure of the Maritime Safety Committee, the Sub-Committee unanimously re-electe d Mr. J. Rasmussen (Denmark), as Chairman and Mr. U. Hallberg (Sweden) as Vice-Chairman for 1997. 29 ANY OTHER BUSINESS  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30  - 40 -  Recommendation ITU-T F.110 - Operational Provisions for the Maritime Mobile Service 29.1 The Sub-Committee considered the liaison statement from ITU-T Study Group 1 (COMSAR 1/29) and noted the attached revised Recommendation ITU-T F.110 - Operational Provisions for the Maritime Mobile Service. 29.2 The Sub-Committee noted that the revised Recommendation ITU-T F.110 is an effectively simplified version of Recommendation ITU-T F.110 which gives provisions for all aspects of operation of radiocommunication services via maritime mobile satellites and radio media of HF, MF, VHF and UHF. 29.3 The Sub-Committee also noted that Recommendation ITU-T F.110 constitutes a part of the Manual for Use by the Maritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile-Satellite Services which, in accordance with Article 26 of the Radio Regulations, is required to be carried on board ships. Regional satellite systems 29.4 The Sub-Committee recalled that COM 40 (COM 40/22, paragraph 7.11) had prepared a draft COM circular on Guidelines for use in evaluating regional mobile satellite systems and MSC 65 (MSC 65/25, paragraph 7.16) had approved it for circulation to Member Governments and SOLAS Contracting Governments, as COM/Circ.128. 29.5 The Sub-Committee noted the status report on the regional mobile satellite system of the United States (COMSAR 1/INF.3) where it is stated that the United States Regional System was designed to meet all requirements for satellite systems and associated coast earth stations forming part of the GMDSS. Its first satellite was launched into geostationary orbit on 7 April 1995. Initial check -out and service validations have been completed successfully. An at -sea test programme is being conducted to validate the requirements of COM/Circ.128 and other IMO requirements, and to determine coverage areas. When the at-sea test programme is complete, the results will be forwarded to the Sub-Committee. Low-Earth Orbit satellite systems 29.6 The Sub-Committee also noted the information provided by the United States (COMSAR 1/INF.13) on various existing and planned Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) two -way data communication systems and their common characteristics relating to the safety of life at sea. Date of the second session of the COMSAR Sub-Committee 29.7 The Sub-Committee noted that the second session of the COMSAR Sub-Comm ittee has tentatively been scheduled to be held from 27 to 31 January 1997. Statement by the delegation of Mexico 29.8 The Sub-Committee noted a statement by the delegation of Mexico, supported by the delegations of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Spain and Uruguay, in regard to delays which had been experienced in the availability of the COMSAR Sub-Committee's documents in Spanish. The delegation of France expressed the same concern. (The full statement of the delegation of Mexico is reproduced in 10). annex Expressions of appreciation 29.9 The Sub-Committee expressed appreciation to: .1 the delegation of Norway for demonstrating equipment selected by Telenor AS for updating the Norwegian coast stations;  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   - 41 -  COMSAR 1/30  .2  the delegation of the United States for providing a briefing on low-earth orbit (LEO) mobile satellite communication services which are being provided by Orbital Communications Corporation (Obcomm) followed by a reception.

In response, the Sub-Committee issued COM/Circ.121 which invited Administrations ""to strongly recommend to their shipowners and ship operators to take early action to ensure that equipment meeting GMDSS carriage requirements is fitted on their ships well in advance of 1 February 1999"". 2 The Sub-Committee on Radiocommunications and Search and Rescue (COMSAR), at its first session (19 to 23 February 1996), noted that the situation has not improved and that only a small percentage of the world's fleet had converted to the GMDSS. 3 The Sub-Committee also noted that manufacturers continue to advise that they will be unable to meet a large surge in demand in 1998 and that early conversion to the GMDSS should be sought. Phased installation of the GMDSS 4 The Sub-Committee has been advised that in order to assist shipowners and ship operators, some Administrations have developed schemes whereby shipowners and ship operators can adopt a phased programme for the installation of GMDSS equipment. The equipment will be installed and commissioned, but will then be immobilized until the ship is ready to change to the new system. 5 These schemes allow shipowners and ship operators to arrange installation work to coincide with a ship's scheduled stay in port, at the same time spreading the financial burden of equipment purchase, and allowing the manufacturers to spread their manufacturing load over a reasonable period. 6 The GMDSS equipment will not be subject to survey during the period that the ship continues to operate under the old distress system. During this phased installation period, the operation of the ship station must be in accordance with non-GMDSS requirements and not be operationally impaired in any way by the new equipment. 7 During the conversion process, Administrations are advised to issue to the ship documentation explaining the status of the radio installation and the type of certificates carried by the ship and the radio operators. GMDSS radio operator training 8 Shipowners and ship operators are reminded that in accordance with SOLAS regulation IV/16 Every ship shall carry personnel qualified for distress and safety radiocommunication purposes to the satisfaction of the Administration. These personnel shall be holders of certificates specified in the Radio Regulations as appropriate, any one of whom shall be designated to have primary responsibility for radiocommunications during distress incidents. 9 Administrations are also reminded that resolution A.769(18) provides procedures and arrangements  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 2 Page 2  for issuing GMDSS certificates to holders of non -GMDSS certificates by ""limited GMDSS examination"". In order to encourage a timely conversion of existing non-GMDSS certificate holders, it should be borne in mind that the arrangements for ""limited GMDSS examination"" should cease on 1 February 1997. After this date all candidates should be required to pass the full GMDSS examination. 10 New entrants, or those not wishing to do the ""limited GMDSS examination"", should be required to pass a full GMDSS General Operator's Certificate (GOC) examination. Purpose designed training courses which incorporate at least the content identified in the IMO GOC model training course should be made available to prepare the candidate for the GOC examination. 11 A significant problem experienced thus far with the implementation of the GMDSS has been the extremely high occurrence of false distress alerts, with the majority of these false alerts attributed to operator incompetence. The lack of adequate mandatory training could be the primary cause of this problem. The STCW Convention was revised in 1995 to increase the minimum standards of competence for the GMDSS GOC and it is extremely important that Administrations implement at least these standards as soon as possible in their examinations for the GOC. Conclusions 12 Therefore, the Maritime Safety Committee in considering the above matters at its sixty-sixth session (28 May to 6 June 1996), recognized that: .1 .2 there is a need to urgently install GMDSS equipment on ships and to train sufficient radio personnel as GMDSS operators; shipowners and ship operators should be made aware that Administrations will not grant exemptions from the carriage of GMDSS equipment, other than those provided for under regulation 3 of SOLAS chapter IV, after 1 February 1999; and if ships have not installed GMDSS equipment and do not have a passenger ship safety certificate and form P or cargo ship safety radio certificate and form R valid for the GMDSS or appropriately certificated radio personnel after 1 February 1999, then such ships could experience considerable delay awaiting the supply of GMDSS equipment and the inability to trade because of non-compliance with the SOLAS or STCW Conventions, or both. ***  .3  I:\COMSAR\1\30.     COMSAR 1/30  ANNEX 3 PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS TO RECOMMENDATION ITU-R M.541-5 ""Procedures and operational instructions for DSC- Distress Calls""  General The proposed changes in procedures and operational instructions for DSC for distress purposes are referred to documents from ITU Radiocommunication Study Group-8; Recommendation ITU-R M.541-5 with reference to its annex 1 and annex 3. Introduction 1 RCC Stavanger have, through the last 3 years since the implementation of GMDSS started 1 February 1992, had some experience with the GMDSS. In general the experience with GMDSS indicates an improvement of the possibilities for a ship in distress to alert a coast station (CRS) or a rescue co-ordination centre (RCC). But there are also experienced an enormous increase in false or inadvertent distress alerts, which mainly are caused by the Digital Selective Calling, DSC (100 % false or inadvertent distress alerts). These false or inadvertent distress alerts have been studied to find what the reason might be. From our point of view we are convinced that this is caused by a combination of: 3 Lack of knowledge and understanding of the DSC system by operators both at sea and ashore; lack of knowledge by operators on how the equipment works; equipment design; slightly improper procedures, which might be misinterpreted by operators.  2  At the 12th North Sea/Baltic DSC meeting Norway presented a document (Doc 12/3/4) with proposals for changes in the DSC Operational procedures. The meeting agreed to support the main philosophy with the proposed changes, with respect to Rec 541 annex 1 paragraph 3.3 and annex 3 part A paragraph 1.2. With reference to the conclusions made at the meeting, and with some additions, Norway has made some revised proposals in an attempt to clarify and improve the operational procedures. The proposals are made specifically with respect to annex 1 and to annex A: 3, part 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 acknowledgement of DSC distress alert (renamed); distress traffic, (to ascertain the correct position of a distress incident); transmission of a DSC distress relay alert; acknowledgement of a DSC distress relay alert received from a coast station (to ensure use of radiotelephony when acknowledging and to avoid unnecessary acknowledgement of distress relays).  4  These proposed modifications are listed on pages 2, 3 and 4 of this annex.

Paragraph 3.3 -ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF DISTRESS CALLS Reverse the order of paragraphs: present paragraph 3.3.3 should become paragraph 3.3.1 reword and renumber existing paragraph 3.3.1 to become 3.3.2 renumber existing paragraph 3.3.2 to become paragraph 3.3.3 which then should read: 3.3.1 Distress calls should normally be acknowledged by DSC only by appropriate coast stations. Coast stations should in addition, set watch on radiotelephony and, if the ""mode of subsequent communication"" signal in the received distress call indicates teleprinter, also on narrow-band direct-printing (NBDP) (see Recommendation ITU-R M.493). In both cases, the radiotelephone and NBDP-frequencies should be those associated with the frequency on which the distress call was received. Acknowledgement by coast stations of DSC distress calls transmitted on MF and HF should be initiated with a minimum delay of 1 minute after receipt of a distress call, and normally within a maximum delay of 2 3/4 minute. This allows all calls within a single frequency or multi-frequency call attempt to be completed. Acknowledgements by coast stations on VHF should be transmitted as soon as practicable. The acknowledgement of a distress call consists of a single DSC acknowledgement call which should be addressed to ""all ships"" and include the identification (see Recommendation ITU-R M.493) of the ship whose distress call is being acknowledged.  3.3.2  3.3.3  With reference to: Recommendation ITU-R M.541-5 Annex 3, Part Instructions for ships AParagraph 1.2ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A DSC DISTRESS ALERT Title is renamed to read: 1.2 ACTIONS ON RECEIPT OF A DSC DISTRESS ALERT Ships receiving a DSC distress alert from another ship should not normally acknowledge the alert by DSC since acknowledge of a DSC distress alert by use of DSC is normally made by coast stations only. Only if no other station seems to have received the DSC distress alert, and the transmission of the DSC distress alert continues, the ship should acknowledge the DSC distress alert by use of DSC to terminate the call. The ship should then, in addition, inform a coast station or a coast earth station by any practicable means. Ships receiving a distress alert from another ship should also defer the acknowledgement of the distress alert by radiotelephony for a short interval, if the ship is within an area covered by one or more coast stations, in order to give the coast station time to acknowledge the DSC distress alert first. Ships receiving a DSC distress alert from another ship shall: I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 3 Page 3  -  watch for the reception of a distress acknowledgement on the distress channel (2187,5 kHz on MF and channel 70 on VHF); acknowledge the receipt of the distress alert by transmitting the following by radiotelephony on the distress traffic frequency in the same band in which the DSC distress alert was received, i.e. 2182 kHz on MF and channel 16 on VHF.

arrange for a GMDSS compliance inspection or take other appropriate corrective action regarding a ship under their jurisdiction which fails to respond to calls from search and rescue authorities; develop an effective national information and follow-up programme to ensure that responsible authorities, manufacturers, training institutes, shipping officials and GMDSS service providers know, understand and properly implement the requirements of SOLAS regulation V/10 and the recommendations of the Organization regarding distress and safety communications and assisting persons in distress; provide guidance to ships on the importance of equipment registration, of proper watchstanding, of avoiding false distress alerts, and of following up to cancel any inadvertent distress alerts; review broadcast practices to minimize excessive use of messages which cause alarms on ship bridges, of message categories which cannot be suppressed by the ship, of unnecessary duplication of information to the same ocean areas, or of transmission to an unnecessarily large area or number of ships; and ensure that search and rescue authorities have ready access to suitable GMDSS databases to support SAR, and access, as appropriate, to use of DSC coast stations domestically or through co-operative arrangements with neighbouring States or assisting ships.  .2  .3  .4  .5  .6  ***  I:\COMSAR\1\30.    COMSAR 1/30  ANNEX 5 DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO RESOLUTION A.706(17) WORLD-WIDE NAVIGATIONAL WARNING SERVICE  To remind NAVAREA and national Co-ordinators of the absolute necessity to monitor their broadcasts on SafetyNET and NAVTEX in order to provide the most efficient and effective services to mariners and reduce their own costs to a minimum, it is proposed to amend Annex 1 of resolution A.706(17) as follows: to add new paragraph 6.2.1.15, ""Monitor the broadcasts which they originate to ensure that the messages have been correctly broadcast"";

Mexico pointed out that during 1996 continual delays had been experienced in the availability of documents. An even more serious situation existed in the COMSAR Sub-Committee. Forty-two of the seventy substantive documents had not been available in Spanish by the stipulated period (a few had not been available in English either), a figure which represented more than half of the documentation. Mexico wishes to emphasize the fact that for three agenda items (items 8, 20 and 22), not one document had been available. As well as being a failure to observe a principle, the absence of documentation by the prescribed time presented a practical problem: it hindered Administrations in their study of the proposals made and in briefing their delegates. Mexico emphasized that its delegation was not receiving sufficient information to enable it to participate on an equal footing in some of IMO's bodies and reiterated its request that the situation should be remedied as soon as possible, in accordance with the Organization's procedures. ***  I:\COMSAR\1\30.    COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 11 DRAFT REVISED WORK PROGRAMME OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE Target completion date 1 Global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS) .1 .2 .3 2 matters relating to the GMDSS Master Plan replies to questionnaire on casualties exemptions from radio requirements Continuous Continuous Continuous  Promulgation of maritime safety information (MSI) (in co -operation with ITU, IHO, WMO and Inmarsat) .1 operational and technical co ordination provisions of MSI services International SafetyNET Service  Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous  .2 3 4 5 6  ITU World Radiocommunication Conference matters Radiocommunication ITU Study -R Group 8 matters Satellite services (Inmarsat and COSPAS -SARSAT) Continuous Matters concerning search and rescue, including those related to the 1979 SAR Conference and the introduction of the GMDSS .1 harmonization of aeronautical and maritime search and rescue procedures including SAR [, training matters]  Continuous  __________ reflect proposed deletion bold letters represent new proposals Target I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 11 Page 2  completion date .2 plan for provision of maritime SAR services including procedures for routeing distress information in the GMDSS revision of the IMOSAR and MERSAR manuals Continuous  Continuous  .3 H.1  Work consequential to the 1988 GMDSS Conference .1 .2 clarification of SOLAS GMDSS provisions review of SOLAS regulation IV/15.7 and resolution A.702(17) on radio maintenance guidelines for the GMDSS related to sea areas A3 and A4 review of the locating functions in the GMDSS l997  l997 [1997] [1998]  .3 H.2  [Future]implementation[and the use]of the GMDSS requirementsin respect ofexisting fishing vessels [by nonConvention ships] Performance standards for shipborne radio equipment and review of GMDSS equipment performance International Code of Signals Ship ide ntification .1 .2 406 MHz EPIRBs ship station identification (SSI) numbers for DSC and SES  H.3  l997 [1997]  H.4 H.5  1996 1996 [1998]  .31 VTS and identification transponders (in co-operation with NAV) __________ reflect proposed deletion bold letters represent new proposals  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 11 Page 3  Target completion date H.6 7 H.7 6 Emergency radiocommunications: false alerts and interference Review of resolution A.703(17) on training of radio personnel in the GMDSS Development of measures complementary to the INF Code Review of resolutions A.534(13) on the Code of Safety for Special Purpose Ships and A.686(17) on the Code of Alarms and Indicators, as amended [Continuous]  [1997] 1996  H.8 H.9  l996 [Continuous]  H.10 8 Completion of the International SAR Plan H.11 7 Rescue operations to be carried out inside wrecks [1997] H.12 8 IMO standard marine communication phrases (co-ordinated by NAV) H.13 9 Ro-ro ferry safety .1 .2 performance standards for VHF/UHF portable radiotelephones co-ordination of the MERSAR manual and the Guide to Helicopter/Ship Operations future work on SAR matters review of the SAR Convention  [1997]  1997  1997 1997 1997 [1998]  .3 .4  [H.10 Review of the Joint IMO/IHO/WMO MSI Manual] __________ reflect proposed deletion bold letters represent new proposals  I:\COMSAR\1\30.   COMSAR 1/30 ANNEX 11 Page 4  Target completion date [H.11 Review of resolution A.764(18) - Establishment, updating and retrieval of the information contained in the registration databases of satellite EPIRBs] L.1 9 Role of the human element in the maritime casualties : guidelines for the on -board use and application of computers (co -ordinated by DE) Safety of passenger submersible craft (co-ordinated by DE)[1997] Review of reporting requirements in IMO instruments (co -ordinated by FSI) SAR training 1996 1996 1996 [1998]  [Continuous] 1996  L.2 1 L.3 X.X X.X  Transmission of updated information for electronic navigational charts  __________ reflect proposed deletion bold letters represent newproposals  ________  I:\COMSAR\1\30."

This includes establishing and maintaining effective relationships with labor organizations that represent Federal employees, negotiating and administering labor agreements and otherwise conferring with labor organizations on behalf of management, and providing guidance, consultation, and staff assistance to management on a variety of labor relations matters. Included positions involved in the Government-wide administration of the Federal labor relations program, such as those involved in policy development, agency guidance, and investigation and resolution of certain complaints and appeals as required under the Executive Orders governing Federal labor relations. Some positions covered by this series also involve advising management on grievances and appeals, adverse actions, employee discipline, and related matters when these are dealt integral part of the labor relations program. Positions covered by this series require as their paramount qualifications a knowledge of Executive Orders, regulations, principles, practices, and technique labor relations; and a knowledge of the objectives, principles, policies, and procedures of personnel management in the Federal service. This standard supersedes part II of the classification standard for the labor Management and Employee Relations Series, GS-0230, issued in June 1966 as the Employee Management Relations and Cooperation Series, GS-0230.  EXCLUSIONS Excluded from this series are: 1. Positions combining labor relations work with work classifiable in one or more other specialized personnel series, other than Employee Relation positions are classified in the Personnel Management Series, GS-0201. 2. Positions that primarily involve technical work concerned with management-employee relations and services not directly concerned with bilateral union-management relationships, such as employee conduct discipline, employee appeals and grievances, performance evaluation and appraisal, management-employee communication, and employee services and benefits. Such positions are classified in the Employee Relations Series, GS-0230. Positions primarily requiring the performance of work described above are classified in the GS-0230 series even though some of the procedures to be followed have been established through bilateral negotiations (e.g., the processing of a grievance through a negotiated grievance procedure). In contrast, positions that are primarily concerned with establishing such procedures through negotiations with unions and interpreting the intended application of the specific provisions of those procedures are classified in the Labor Relations Series, GS-0233.

Such positions are classified in the Contractor Industrial Relations Series, GS-0246.  Positions that involve providing labor relations training requiring subject-matter knowledges but for which the career pattern is primarily associated with the field of education and training. Such positions are classified in the Training Instruction Series, GS-1712, and are evaluated by reference to the Grade Evaluation Guide for Instructor and Specialist Positions Involving Education relations training work for which the paramount qualification requirements for the work and the career pattern for the positions are primarily in labor relations are classified in this series (GS-0233). Positions that involve providing labor relations training but that have as their paramount qualification an understanding of the relationship of employee development and training to management problems and methods, and procedures. Such positions are classified in the Employee Development Series, GS-0235.    RELATIONSHIP TO THE EMPLOYEE RELATIONS SERIES While labor relations and employee relations positions require knowledges, skills, and abilities sufficiently different to warrant separate series designations, there is also sufficient overlap in the kinds of and responsibilities performed so that a combination of work typical of both series in a single position is not considered to be appropriate classifiable in the GS-0201 series. Therefore, combinations of work typical of the Labor Relations Series, GS-0233, and the Employee Series, GS-0230 are to be classified in whichever of those two series represents the highest grade level of work and the paramount requirements of the position. If the work in each of these two series is of the same grade level, the principal duties and responsibility series determination, i.e., the position will be classified in the series appropriate to the work that takes up a majority of the employee's work time. If the grade level and principal duties and responsibilities of the work in the two series are the same, the position should be classified in the Labor Relations the Labor Relations Series, GS-0233.

Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist is the title for all supervisory positions.  OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION Labor relations is a dynamic and rapidly evolving part of personnel management in the Federal service. While unionism among Federal employees can be traced back to the early days of labor organizations in this country, the issuance in January 1962 of E.O. 10988 established for the first time a government-wide policy for dealings between labor organizations and Federal agencies. This Executive Order set forth the responsibilities, rights, and obligations of both labor organizations agencies, and provided a framework by which recognition, consultation, and negotiation with labor organizations could be accomplished. Executive Orders 11491, 11616, and 11838 issued in October 1969, August 1971, and February 1975 respectively (hereinafter referred to as ""E.O. 11491 as amended"" or, ""the executive order"") maintain the basic principles and objectives of labor-management relations established by E.O. 10988. They are evolutionary in nature and continue the system of relationships that had developed between unions and agencies. However, E.O. 11491 as amended contains far-reaching changes in the overall labor relations structure. The key changes are to: S Establish a central authority, the Federal Labor Relations Council, to administer and interpret the order, decide major policy issues, prescribe regulations, and consider certain appeals; Provide third-party processes for resolving representation and unfair labor practice disputes (by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations); Use the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to aid in resolving negotiation impasses; Establish the Federal Service Impasses Panel as the ultimate authority for resolving impasses; Provide for negotiated grievance procedures which may include binding arbitration; Establish exclusive recognition as the only form of recognition at the operating level.  S S S S S  Major distinctions under the new Executive Order are the availability of third-party processes and the impact of labor relations case decisions.  THE LABOR RELATIONS PROCESS This section outlines the labor relations (LR) process, and the typical role of the Labor Relations Specialist (LRS) in that process, at the operating level. For editorial convenience, the process is Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page4  described as concerns a single bargaining unit at an activity. In practice, of course, there are often two or more units, which may be represented by the same or different unions. This multiplicity of units is a complicating factor in the job of the LRS, and is covered in greater detail in subsequent sections of the standard. For descriptive purposes, operating labor relations (LR) programs in the Federal service can be separated into three broad phases: organization and recognition, agreement negotiation, and agreement administration. In practice, however, these phases are by no means mutually exclusive, with some activities occurring in two or even all three phases. For example, negotiation with unions on changes in personnel practices is required as soon as exclusive recognition is granted, whether a formal agreement has been negotiated. Similarly, unfair labor practice charges may be instituted by a union, an employee, or by management at any stage, including the period during which a union is attempting to organize employees for the purpose of gaining recognition. New agreements are negotiated periodically, concurrent with administration of the existing agreement. While management should always have a general awareness of the Federal labor relations program, the LR process begins when one or more unions show an interest in organizing a group of employees at an activity. The LRS informs managers and supervisors of the requirements of the LR program and advises them on the kinds of union activities to expect and the ways in which they should and should not react to these activities. The LRS also contacts the union organizers, who might be employees of the activity and/or representatives from the headquarters of the union, to establish a cooperative relationship and to work out suitable arrangements for organizing activities. The organization phase can be more difficult for the LRS if two or more unions are attempting to organize the same group of employees. The LRS must ensure that equal privileges are available for all groups if requested (including any employees who wish to campaign against tile unions) an ensure that management does not inappropriately interfere with organizing activities or express preferences for any particular employee group, or for having no union, to avoid possible unfair labor practice charges against the activity. When the union or unions gain sufficient employee interest, they file a petition for exclusive recognition with the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (hereafter called the Assistant Secretary). The LRS advises management on the appropriateness of the petitioned-for unit and prepares documentation necessary Secretary to make the final decision. If management disagrees with the unit requested by the union, the Assistant Secretary may hold a hearing, in which case the LRS may represent management at the hearing or prepare the factual material to be presented by another representative selected by management. When the Assistant Secretary approves a unit as being appropriate, the LRS works out the arrangements with the union for an election to be held under the Assistant Secretary. The ballots are counted by the Assistant Secretary's agent, with observers from both the union and the activity present. If no objections to the conduct of the election are filed, the Assistant Secretary certifies the results of the election, designating the exclusive representative, if any. As indicated above, the right to meet and confer is gained by a union as soon as it is certified as the exclusive representative of employees in a bargaining unit, even though an agreement has not Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page5  been negotiated. The LRS advises management on those matters for which negotiation is mandatory, those that; while not subject to mandatory negotiation should be the subject of consultation in order to establish and maintain a good bilateral relationship with the union, and those to be retained as management prerogatives. In many cases, the LRS will meet with the union officials to work out some basic procedures such as those concerning dues withholding, use of official time by union officials and stewards, communication processes, etc. The LRS then maintains regular contacts with management and union officials to ensure that the union is, in fact, being conferred with on appropriate matters, and to assist in working out problems. The next step in the LR process is the negotiation of an agreement between the management of the activity and the union local having exclusive recognition for a bargaining unit. There are, however, a number of instances where, for a variety of reasons, a union does not wish to negotiate a formal agreement for a particular bargaining unit. In such cases, the LR process remains at the stage discussed above, until such time as the union or management decides to negotiate an agreement or, in rare instances, the employees in the unit vote to discontinue having that union as its exclusive representative (decertification election). For the LRS, the negotiation phase is, for all practical purposes, a perpetual one, beginning at the time a union is attempting to organize a unit and continuing as long as the union has exclusive recognition. For example, during the organization phase, the LRS must be aware of promises made by the union, as these promises provide significant clues as to the issues likely to be raised for the first agreement negotiation. Similarly, the areas of disagreement between management and the union in the period after the union gains exclusive recognition but before negotiations are requested will also most likely be reflected in the issues to be negotiated. The following are typical tasks performed by the LRS as part of the negotiation phase: S Obtains and analyzes input from all levels of management to the activity's policies on and positions for negotiation; Based on past experiences in dealing with the union, a review of the activity's grievance files and discussions with supervisors and managers, develops and researches potential union proposals in order to have a ""head starts in the preparations for negotiation; Advises top management on establishing a management negotiating team - suggests particularly well-qualified candidates, and trains those selected in current LR practices and precedents and in negotiating techniques. Depending on the desires of management and the skills of the individual may serve as (1) the chairman and chief spokesman for the team, (2) a participating member, but not chairman, of the team, or (3) as an advisor to, but not a formal member of the team. Participates in and/or advises on the following activities of the management negotiating team:  S  S  S  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233   Page6  Meets with the union negotiators to establish ground rules for negotiations, such as official time allowed for negotiations, schedule for meetings, number of negotiators and observers, rules on introduction of proposals, etc.; Develops management proposals; Exchanges initial proposals with the union team - may meet with the union team to clarify the meaning of the respective proposals; Analyzes the union proposals, utilizing other personnel and operating officials as necessary to determine the ramifications and costs of each one; Develops documentation necessary for review of higher headquarters, and when required, the Federal Labor Relations Council, in cases where the activity determines that one or more of the union's proposals are non-negotiable under the provisions of E.O. 11491; Develops negotiating strategies, including counter-proposals, final positions, trade-offs, etc.; Obtains concurrence of top management on positions to be taken may have to ""sell"" top management on the propriety of the proposals and, when necessary, revises the proposals to reflect unforeseen management needs; Negotiates ""at-the-table"" with the union team, presenting management positions, analyzing revised union proposals, and changing strategies as the situation requires; When agreement is reached by both parties on all issues, obtains formal approval of the agreement from the head of the activity and from higher headquarters as required.            S  In the event the parties cannot reach agreement on particular issues, mediation(through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service) may be called for, and eventually, unresolved issues may be submitted to the Federal Service Impasses Panel for resolution. The LRS prepares or assists in preparing documentary materials to be submitted to the third party and sometimes is also called on to present the management views orally. Prepares a record of the significant details relating to the negotiations, which serves as background information for future negotiations, as well as documentary evidence in the event there are later disagreements on the intent of specific provisions of the agreement. Develops and conducts or assists in developing and conducting training sessions to explain the meaning of and advise on the implementation of the terms of the agreement to management officials and supervisors  S  S  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 S  Page7  Keeps a continuing record of issues and problems arising from the implementation of the agreement, with input from supervisors and managers, in preparation for the next round of negotiations.  After an agreement has been negotiated, the parties must apply its provisions in the day-to-day operations of the various organizations included in the bargaining unit. However, the agreement administration phase of the LMR process typically involves much more than a mechanical application of the words of an agreement. In any agreement that is concerned with substantive issues, there may be disagreements regarding the interpretation of a provision, either as to the original intent during negotiations or as to the application to a specific situation. The LRS is normally the point of contact for both union and management officials on such questions and attempts to find factory to both parties, either on the basis of the LRS's own knowledge of personnel management or by obtaining the assistance of other personnel specialists. Disagreements between the union or individual employees and management (except those covered by statutory appeals procedures) may be processed through a negotiated grievance procedure. The LRS advises the management officials responsible for responding to the grievance at the various steps of the procedure concerning the meaning of applicable provisions of the agreement, how arbitrators have decided similar issues, possible compromise solutions, and the chances of a favorable decision should the issued go to arbitration. If the grievance is not resolved within the agency, the negotiated procedure may, and often does, provide for binding arbitration as the final step. The LBS advises top management on the selection of an arbitrator from a panel submitted by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or from other sources as agreed to by the parties, and prepares or assists in the preparation of necessary documentary pre- and post-hearing briefs, to be submitted to the arbitrator. Some LSRs also serve as spokesmen for management at arbitration hearings or act as technical advisors to another management representative. They may also advise on the propriety of appealing an arbitrators decision and prepare or assist in preparing written materials necessary to do so. In addition to matters involving the specific provisions of the negotiated agreement, the role of the LRS in this phase of the LR process also includes continuing participation in management's efforts to maintain a good working relationship with the union. For example, the LRS maintains regular contacts with both union and management discuss matters of mutual interest and to learn of, and problems before they become serious. Some LRS may also review proposed issuance of the personnel office and other administrative offices to ensure that the union has been consulted on those areas of concern to them and bilateral agreement reached on matters appropriate for negotiation. At times, certain actions of management or the union, (e.g., failure by management to negotiate a change in personnel policies and practices affecting working conditions) result in unfair labor practice complaints and charges. The LBS typically investigates the complaint, advises management on an appropriate resolution based on the facts of the case precedent decisions of the Assistant Secretary in similar cases, and attempts to resolve the complaint informally. If informal Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page8  resolution not accomplished and formal charges are filed, the LBS prepares or assists in preparing briefs and other materials for hearings and recommends appropriate offers of settlement. When appropriate recommend and participate in appeals of the decision.  COVERAGE OF THE STANDARD This standard provides grade-level criteria directly applicable to non-supervisory Labor Relations Specialist positions at grades GS-05 through GS-12 performing operating or ""first-line"" labor relations work (such as that described in the ""Occupational Information"" section above). Such positions are most often found at the local activity level of agencies though they may be found at any echelon when responsibility for performing significant portions of operating labor relations work has been retained at that level.  TREATMENT OF OTHER LABOR RELATIONS FUNCTIONS The following kinds of labor relations positions and functions are not directly covered by the grade level criteria in this standard, although they are appropriately classified in the labor Relations Series, GS-0233. S Agency Staff Positions - Most Federal agencies have positions at various echelons in the organization above the operating level with responsibility for a variety of staff functions in connection with the labor relations program. Such functions may include, for example, developing agency-wide or area-wide policy and regulatory materials.' evaluating operating-level labor relations programs; representing the agency and the local activities in third party procedures. reviewing negotiated agreements for conformance with applicable laws. appropriate agency regulations and regulations of other appropriate authorities; and providing technical guidance to operating-level Labor Relations Specialists. The criteria in part II of the classification standard for the Personnel in this standard should lie used as basic guides in evaluating positions. Positions Involved in the Government-wide Labor Relations Program-Positions included in this series are found in several agencies with responsibility for the Government-wide administration of the Federal labor relations program. Such positions are located in the Federal Labor Relations Council, on the staff of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations, and in the US. Office of Personnel Management. They may be classified by comparison with and extension of the criteria in this standard and other related standards such as that for the Labor Management Relations Examining Series, GS-244, and by application of sound classification principles. Supervisory positions in this series are evaluated by reference to part II of the General Schedule Supervisory Guide. (Many supervisory positions also include a substantial amount of nonsupervisory LR work that may equal or even exceed the level of work performed by the employees supervised. In such cases, the positions should be treated as mixed positions; the supervisory responsibilities should be classified by the General Schedule Supervisory Guide, Main Menu Exit  S  S   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page9  while the nonsupervisory work should be separately evaluated on its own merit by reference to the criteria in this standard.)  CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA The grade levels in this standard are presented under the following two criteria: S S Nature of assignment; and Level of responsibility  Nature of assignment This factor measures the scope and complexity of the work assignments, as well as the extent of knowledge of labor relations and personnel management principles, methods, and techniques required to do the work. Assignments range from on-the-job and classroom training in the fundamentals of labor relations to performing complex assignments involving the resolution of a variety of difficult problems.  Level of responsibility This factor covers the kind and degree of supervision received, the degree of judgment and independence required, and the nature of the person-to-person contacts involved in LR Specialist positions. Levels range from detailed instructions relating to very specific assignments and complete review of work, to independent performance of difficult work requiring a high degree of judgment and originality in resolving complex problems.  KNOWLEDGES, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES REQUIRED The kinds and levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities required in this occupation are not described under a separate factor in the grade-level criteria. Rather they are reflected in the discussion of the other classification factors. Knowledges required in Labor Relations Specialist positions include: S S S Personnel management and labor relations theories, principles, and practices; Laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies, and concepts pertaining to Federal labor relations; Current issues, practices, problems, and precedents in Federal and non-Federal sector labor relations.  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 Skills and Abilities required include: S  Page10  Ability to establish and maintain effective work relationships with local and national representatives of unions and with agency managers and supervisors, with full consideration of the bilateral nature of labor relations; Ability to balance labor relations requirements against overall management goals; Ability to perform and/or guide others in the negotiation of labor agreements; Ability to provide guidance and advice to management on the implementation and application of negotiated agreements; Tact, discretion, and the ability to obtain the cooperation of others; Skill in written and oral communication; Ability to gather and analyze facts, draw conclusions, and devise practical solutions to problems; Ability to exercise originality and ingenuity in devising solutions to problems; Ability to work calmly and effectively in sensitive, stress-producing situations.  S S S S S S  S S  NOTES TO USERS 1. Labor Relations Specialist positions are evaluated in terms of the actual duties and responsibilities performed, rather than the organizational level at which the position is located, the mission of the organization served, or the total workload of the labor-management relations staff. For example, a specialist position at a major industrial installation having many bargaining units that present numerous complex problems may be assigned to provide LR services to an organizational segment having two small bargaining units with problems of average difficulty. The grade level of this position would be lower than other specialist positions that are in the same organization but have more difficult assignments. The effect of organizational level on a position is taken into-account by considering the scope and impact of recommendations and decisions, the nature of the controls and guidelines received from higher authority, the nature of the control exercised over LR activities at lower levels and the nature and difficulty of the person-to-person relationships required by the organizational level involved. 2. Some positions in operating programs are sole Labor Relations Specialists, or supervise one or two subordinates. The grade-level criteria in this standard will normally apply to such positions. In some cases, however, such positions are delegated essentially-full and  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page11  independent responsibility for policy development and program planning concerning labor relations at a local activity. Such responsibility typically includes: S Serving, under general administrative supervision, as the local organization's final technical authority in the field of labor relations; Formulating the organization's labor relations policies and objectives, and selectively determining the LR activities to be included and emphasized in the program; Planning and scheduling work to meet program goals and broad objectives established by a higher organizational level of the agency; Integrating the labor relations program with other personnel management functions and with related management assistance staff activities, such as budget administration and manpower planning.  S  S S  Positions which fully meet these program responsibility characteristics often place on the employee a technical demand and degree of responsibility and independence that' clearly and substantially exceeds that of the operating LR work described in this standard. In such cases, the position should be considered for classification at one level above that determined by application of the grade level criteria in this standard, except that this provision is not to be used by itself to classify a job above the GS-11 level. The final grade level determination must be based on sound classification judgment with consideration of proper alignment with other properly classified positions in the organization. ** S Labor relations work is unusual among occupations generally in that its primary purpose is to advise one group (management) on negotiating with another group (unions) in an adversary relationship on the way in which management will conduct its business as it relates to the treatment of its employees. There is no right or wrong way to handle most situations that arise; rather, there is only a way that ends up being accepted by both parties, often as a compromise, and that is hopefully the best management under the circumstances. The result of the work is not a concrete product that can easily be measured in terms of difficulty or complexity. Rather, there are various factors in the total work situation that impact on the difficulty and complexity of problems encountered and the nature of the ""solutions"" to those problems, all of which interact with each other to different degrees, depending on the particular circumstance. Because of the variability of this interaction, particular issues and problems cannot be categorized into levels of difficulty without considering all of the conditions exerting an influence on them. The following illustrate the interrelationships of the variables in labor relations work: S The complexity of LR activities is related, in part, to the nature and complexity of the organizations serviced. In order to effectively advise and represent management in negotiations and day-to-today dealings with unions, LR Specialists must have a substantial Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page12  knowledge of the missions, management philosophies, goals, and production objectives of the organizations serviced. Thus, all other things being equal, larger, more complex, and constantly changing organizations place greater demands for knowledge and judgement on the LRS concerned. S The number of employees in the bargaining units serviced and the relationship of the size of the unit to the total number of employees at the activity also can affect the degree of knowledge and judgment required of the LRS. For example, the number of employees can impact on the complexity of negotiating a particular action; e.g., management can ""live with"" a proposal to provide employees with a piece of equipment when it involves a small number/percentage of employees but could not afford to agree to that same action if it involved a much larger number. In the latter situation, a greater degree of insight and judgment on the part of the LRS is required to determine the full impact of the proposed action and to devise alternatives that will satisfy the critical requirements in consideration of the needs of a variety of employees as well as those of management. The apparent difficulty or lack of difficulty involved in negotiating and consulting with unions may be the result of one or any combination of a variety of factors. In' evaluating LRS positions, it is necessary to look beneath the surface to establish the actual role of the LRS on maintaining effective relationships with unions. For example, a harmonious situation may reflect a general lack of aggressiveness on the part of the LR Specialist in achieving a rapport with an otherwise aggressive union that is conducive to constructive resolution of problems. The reverse may also be true. A situation involving numerous negotiation impasses, grievances, unfair labor practice charges, etc., may be due to unreasonable attitudes of management and/or unions, or to the inability of the LRS to assess the situation correctly, suggest adequate compromise solutions or otherwise establish a constructive relationship with and between the parties concerned. The nature of the unions having exclusive recognition and the organization of the bargaining units may also affect the difficulty of the LR work. For example, the exclusive representative of a unit may be a council of locals comprised of 10 or 15 locals each representing different trades; or several units may request multi-unit bargaining (negotiation of one agreement covering several separate units). On one hand, these may make negotiation and consultation easier in that there is only one entity to deal with and' only one agreement to negotiate and apply. However, problems may also be added as a result of internal differences of views within the council or group of units that the LR Specialist must be aware of and take into account in attempting to find solutions to problems. These kinds of situations must also be carefully analyzed and evaluated in attempting to determine the appropriate grade of a Labor Relations Specialist position.  S  S  It is this combination and interaction of the variables that establish the grade level rather than the presence of any particular element. Since individual positions will not necessarily match all elements at any grade level, sound classification judgment must be used to determine the level that most nearly reflects the overall grade level concept. Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 S  Page13  The numerical elements used in the grade level criteria are intended to reflect complexities typically resulting from their presence and the knowledges, skills, and abilities needed to deal with these complexities. The numerical examples are illustrative and do not, in themselves, represent intrinsic values that fix grade levels, nor do they establish absolute limits, either upper or lower, for any level. Furthermore, the numerical data used will not necessarily be found in a fixed or constant relationship in actual positions. Consequently, elements measured by numerical data should be considered in their proper relationship to the qualitative elements which are also described. The grade level criteria in this standard are based on a ""normal delegation of responsibility from higher headquarters and from the Personnel Officer at the local activity (essentially as described in the ""Occupational Information"" section of the standard). In some instances, however, the higher echelons of Personnel Officers involve themselves in recommendations and decisions ordinarily within the responsibility of LR Specialists (e.g., requiring a review of essentially all actions to be taken, including routine recommendations for the resolution of relatively minor problems, prior to discussing them with the union or management). This involvement may be by direction of the higher authority or at the request of the LR Specialists or their immediate supervisors. In either case, such involvement, if it occurs on a regular basis, serves to weaken the ""Level of responsibility"" factor and must be carefully considered in assigning a grade level to a position. The grad-level criteria in this Positions above grade GS-12 with the application of sound Management Series, GS-201 standard cover positions in grades GS-05 through GS-12. should be evaluated by extension of the criteria in this standard position-classification judgment. The standard for Personnel may also be used where applicable.  S  S  LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST, GS-0233-05 Nature of the Assignment This is an entrance or trainee level. Labor Relations Specialists, GS-05, receive classroom and on-the-job training in the principles, theories, methods, and techniques of labor relations and personnel management, as well as instruction in agency organization, mission, policies, and objectives. Work assignments involve performing a variety of tasks designed to provide the opportunity to apply the basic principles, procedures, techniques, and guidelines.  Level of Responsibility Labor Relations Specialists, GS-05, receive close supervision from the supervisor or a higher grade specialist. Assignments increase in complexity as knowledge of basic principles and techniques is acquired. GS-05 LR Specialists perform assignments with specific instructions as to work to be accomplished, methods to be used, and applicable guide lines. Work is closely reviewed in progress and on completion for adherence to instructions, technical soundness, and overall acceptability. Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page14  Guidelines include public laws; Executive Orders; issuances and precedent decisions of the Department of Labor, and the Federal Labor Relations Council; US. Office of Personnel Management regulations and instructions; agency policies and directives; and local instructions. Personal contacts at this level are primarily for the purpose of requesting and providing factual information.  LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST, GS-0233-07 Nature of Assignment This is a developmental level. Work assignments of moderate complexity are selected to combine productive work with supervised on-the-job training in the judgmental aspects of labor relations. In comparison, GS-05 LR Specialists are provided training and work assignments primarily for the purpose of learning and applying the basic principles and techniques of the occupation. Examples of developmental assignments include: independently gathering factual information from regulatory material, existing negotiated labor agreements, and other technical references for use by higher grade specialists; developing portions of instructions, procedures, and reports; participating with higher grade specialists in discuss stewards, employees, and first-line supervisors concerning interpretation or application of a negotiated agreement, complaints and grievances, advice on day-to-day dealings with unions, etc.  Level of Responsibility GS-07 Labor Relations Specialists receive assignments with instructions as to the methods and procedures to be followed and the results expected. The assignments are then carried through to completion. In contrast, GS-05 specialists receive specific and detailed instruction throughout each step of the assignment. When working on new or unusual problems, GS-07 LR Specialists receive continuing guidance and instructions during the progress of their work. Completed work is reviewed for technical soundness, adherence to instructions, and acceptability of recommendations. GS-07 LR Specialists make recommendations on solutions to problems encountered in performing developmental assignments, however those recommendations that are not clearly covered by policies, directives, precedents, or well established procedures are reviewed before final action is taken. Personal contacts are with individual employees, first-line supervisors, and local union representatives to obtain and provide information on non-controversial matters and to explain well-established policies, procedures, and regulatory requirements.  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page15  LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST, GS-0233-09 Nature of Assignment The GS-09 level is characterized by the independent performance of assignments of moderate complexity requiring the application of fundamental principles, concepts, techniques, and guidelines of labor relations. In comparison, GS-07 LR Specialists, while they may work on similar assignments for training purposes, are given substantial supervisory assistance, as they are not expected to have or apply a full knowledge of LR principles and techniques. Assignments at the GS-09 level are typically concerned with carrying out specific phases of an established labor relations program. Assignments encompass problems that are similar to those previously encountered in the organization an-or can be handled by selecting and interpreting appropriate applicable guidelines. Minor adaptation or modification of precedents and guidelines may be required to fit the local situation, however more complex or controversial matters are referred to the supervisor or specialist of higher grade. The following duties are typical of those performed by GS-09 LR Specialists (these are illustrative of the concept of the overall level of difficulty - no one example is intended, in itself, to establish the grade level): S Prepares documentation for unit determination by the Assistant Secretary in cases where management is in general agreement with the unit proposed by the union; Coordinates arrangements for representation elections (e.g., space for voting, procedures for identifying eligible employees, posting notices, time of election, etc.) Must use judgment in working out arrangements with union (s) to avoid unfair labor practice charges; Participates in preparing for and conducting negotiations of labor agreements with unions, performing such tasks as; S analyzing records of the activity's past experience with negotiated agreements to suggest possible unions demands and to recommend initial management positions for new negotiations; researching and evaluating facts, laws, regulations, and precedents concerning union proposals; providing technical advice to members of the management negotiating team on procedural points of order, basic negotiating techniques and methods of presentation, and recommendations as to initial and fall back positions on relatively uncomplicated issues, such as order of priority in scheduling annual leave, amplification of agency rules concerning sick leave, employee parking, etc.; and Main Menu Exit  S  S  S S   Labor Relations, GS-0233 S preparing initial drafts of articles agreed to by the negotiating teams.  Page16  d. Provides advice to first-line supervisors and union stewards on the interpretation and application of specific provisions of the negotiated agreement. Problems encountered at this level are of limited scope and complexity (e.g., do not typically concern issues having significant impact on production or involving significant cost to the organization). Recommended solutions do not deviate significantly from precedent cases or other applicable guidelines. e. Performs factfinding in connection with unfair labor practice charges and complaints that arise from the activities application or interpretation of the negotiated agreement. Gathers pertinent information from union and management representatives and makes recommendations as to possible resolutions to the supervisor or higher grade LRS.  Level of Responsibility Labor Relations Specialists, GS-09, receive general instructions from the supervisor or specialist of higher grade as to the objectives of the assignment and work priorities. More detailed instructions are provided when new, unusual, or controversial situations are anticipated. By comparison, GS-07 LR Specialists receive specific instructions as to the methods to be followed in carrying out the assignments. As at GS-07, completed work is reviewed for adherence to instructions, technical soundness, and adequacy of recommendations and conclusions. Personal contacts typical of the GS-09 level are with first-line supervisors, union stewards, and employees of the activity. GS-09 LR Specialists are responsible for maintaining effective working relationships with management and union officials in order to promote cooperation by both parties. By comparison with GS-07, where contacts are primarily to give and receive factual information, many contacts at the GS-09 level are for the purpose of interpreting provisions of negotiated agreements and suggesting resolutions to problems.  LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST, GS-0233-11 Nature of Assignment Labor Relations Specialists, GS- 11, perform a variety of duties that require the application of the full range of Labor relations theories, principles, methods, and techniques. Assignments are more difficult than at GS-09 and require more originality and judgment because the problems encountered are less well defined, precedent cases and guidelines are not directly applicable, and the organizations serviced are typically more complex. The following characteristics are typical of the difficulty of labor relations work at GS- 11.  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page17  1. At GS-11, Labor Relations Specialists typically service an organization or group of organizational segments that is moderately complex in terms of the variety of missions, production objectives, number and kinds of employees, working conditions, etc. that affect the knowledge and judgment required. This level of complexity is illustrated by the following examples (these are illustrative of the concept of an overall level of complexity - no one example is intended, in itself, to establish the level to be credited): S The bargaining unit (s) serviced include employees in several organizational segments in which the missions and work production goals are easily understood and relatively stable. The LRS services a single bargaining unit covering a preponderance (e.g., 75 percent) of an organization of moderately small size (e.g., 1000 - 2000 employees); three bargaining units represented by the same union. one of which covers a significant port of the total population of an organization of moderate size (e.g., 30 percent) of an organization of 2,200 - 3,500 employees) or comparably smaller percentage of a larger organization (e.g. 10 percent of an organization of 5,000 employees); two bargaining units represented by different unions that include a combined total of 100-700 employees in an organization of moderate size; or other combinations essentially equivalent in complexity to the above. The employees in the units serviced are in a variety of occupations, most of which are either white collar or trades and crafts. Many of the employees have relatively standard working conditions, although several of the occupations have working conditions that add a moderate degree of complexity (e.g., a small computer group working three shifts with some over-time required, a group of firefighters working rotating shifts involving standby time, or wage grade employees performing maintenance work involving irregular overtime assignments and some eligible for an environmental differential). The employees in the units serviced are typically at one physical location, although there may be a small number at other locations. There is some instability in the organization or organizational segments in that there are occasional changes in workload, staffing requirements, an-or changes in technology result in some realignment of work assignments, retraining of employees, minor reductions-in-force (e.g., involving up to 50 employees) etc;  S  S  S S  2. The unions involved are active in their dealings with management in that they frequently raise substantive issues in agreement negotiations, in policing the application of the negotiated agreements, and in conferring with management on changes in personnel policy and working conditions. However, the relationships between the unions and management can be characterized as cooperative in that there is a willingness of both parties to resolve problems through consultation and compromise. There are, therefore, relatively few issues that go through third party procedures for resolution. Problem solving may also be facilitated because the unions' controversial issues are essentially matters of local concern and dealings are  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page18  primarily with officials with little direct assistance from a national headquarters in such area's as negotiations and third-party proceedings. 3. The typical problems dealt with by the GS-11 LR Specialist, whether in negotiations. agreement implementation, third-party proceedings. or other day-today contacts with union and management representatives are characterized by the following: S They involve issues for which guidelines and precedent decisions are available but require considerable interpretation and adaptation to develop solutions for the local situation; The issues typically have a significant impact on production, cost to the organization, and/or the effective operation of the organizational segments represented, although they normally involve a relatively small percentage of the employees of the organization; The problems are typically uncomplicated in that there are normally few if any difficult sub-problems that must be broken out and separately considered, however their resolution requires the consideration of the overall personnel management viewpoint.  S  S  Typical examples of such problems and issues, when they generally meet the above criteria, are: S S S S Assignment of overtime Amount of clean-up time permitted Merit promotion procedures Unit determination in which management and union disagree on appropriateness of unit at this level there are precedent cases that are somewhat similar to the instant case but there are several differences that must be explored and clearly defined and explained in the required documentation; Unfair Labor Practice charge by the union concerning management's failure to confer on procedures relating to a reduction-in-force involving- a small number of employees in an organizational segment.  S  4. Other advisory services to management provided at this level include the following: S S Conducting planned, systematic studies to develop management positions and to respond to union demands at the bargaining table; Advising negotiating committee members on the applicability and interpretation of arbitration decisions and precedent decisions of the Assistant Secretary and the Federal Labor Relations Council to the local situation; Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 S  Page19  Communicating government-wide and agency LR policies and procedures to management and staff of the local organization or organizational segments serviced.  Level of Responsibility GS-11 LR Specialists receive their assignments in terms of overall purpose and scope, without specific instructions as to the methods and techniques to be used. The LR Specialists develop the plan, procedures, and operating methods for their own assignments. However, the supervisor is available for assistance on unusually difficult or controversial problems or on matters of a policy nature. In comparison, GS-09 LR Specialists receive instructions as to the handling of anticipated problems. At GS-11, review of completed work is for conformance with applicable policies and guidelines and for overall effectiveness. Personal contacts are more difficult than at GS-09 in that they involve consultation and negotiation with local union officers and stewards, and with management officials at all levels of the local organization, concerning difficult and controversial issues and problems. LR Specialists, therefore, must be able to explain clearly and effectively their views on approaches to resolving: such problems, including the application and interpretation of precedent cases. They must exercise considerable tact in gaining the cooperation of both parties in reaching and accepting satisfactory solutions. Additionally, contacts at this level often involve discussions with LR Specialists at higher level headquarters to obtain advice and assistance on matters of agency-or government-wide scope, such as those concerning the agency interpretation of precedent decisions of the Assistant Secretary and the Federal Labor Relations Council. At this level, LR Specialists typically take part in negotiations as an equal member of the management team, although in a few instances, e. g., for a unit representing a rather small portion of the organization in which controversial issues are not expected to arise, they may be designated as the chief negotiator. Additionally, LR Specialists at this level often take part in third-party proceedings, such as arbitration hearings and proceedings involving unfair labor practice charges, as a technical advisor and witness for management. In these situations, the issues involved are typically at the level of difficulty described under ""Nature of Assignment"" above.  LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST, GS-0233-12 Nature of Assignment GS-12 labor relations specialist perform a wide variety of difficult assignments that require extensive training and experience in LR theories, principles, and practices, and a broad understanding of management objectives and implications of the agency's labor relations program. Assignments at this level require a high degree of judgment and originality in resolving complex and controversial problems, often requiring substantial modification and adaptation of guidelines and application of innovative approaches for specific situations.  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 The following characteristics are typical of the difficulty of labor relations work at GS-12.  Page20  1. Labor Relations Specialists, GS-12, typically service an organization or group of organizational segments that is more complex than those typical of the GS- 11 level in terms of the variety of missions, production objectives, number and kinds of employees, working conditions etc. that affect the knowledge and judgment required. This level of complexity is illustrated by the following examples (these are illustrative of the concept of an overall level of complexity - no one example is intended, in itself, to establish the level to be credited): S The bargaining unit(s) serviced include employees in a substantial number of organizational segments, several of which have distinctive and diverse missions requiring a knowledge of goal and objectives in several functional areas. The LRS services a single bargaining unit covering a preponderance (e.g., 75 percent) of an organization of moderate size (e.g., 2200 - 3500 employees); several bargaining units (e. g., 3-5) represented by two or three unions, two of which cover a combined total of approximately 40% of the population of an organization of moderate size; two or three bargaining units represented by the same union, at least one of which covers a significant portion of an organization of moderately large size (e.g., 30 percent of an organization of 3700 - 6000 employees); or other combinations essentially equivalent in complexity to the above. The employees in the unit (s) serviced are in a wide variety of occupations, normally including mixtures of both GS and wage grade or professional and non-professional, many of which have substantial differences in working conditions and occupational practices. An example of this level of complexity is an industrial activity in which the units service by the LRS include a wide variety of trades and crafts employees, engineers and technicians, cafeteria workers, clerical employees, guards, and fire fighters, many of which have different problems involving shift operations, standby duty, overtime, environmental pay, promotional opportunities, etc. Another example is an organization in which the unit(s) serviced by the LRS include a wide variety of professional, administrative, and clerical employees having such varied employment situations as a large number of low grade employees with routine and monotonous duties to perform varied overtime and shift requirements, many employees with very limited promotional opportunities, etc. Many of the employees in the units serviced may be in several geographically dispersed locations; e.g., a regional office that provides the first full level of LR services to 5 or 6 small offices in several States. The missions of the organizational segments in which the units serviced are located are relatively dynamic, resulting in frequent changes in personnel policies, working conditions, employment levels,; etc. (e.g., major realignments of duties, positions, and employees; changes in technology requiring substantial retraining of employees; relatively frequent  S  S  S  S  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page21  reductions-in-force, many of which are limited in coverage but occasionally involve a large number of employees, etc.) S The units serviced may include one or more ""tenant"" activities under separate and autonomous management (most often found in defense organizations). In these situations, the LRS must be aware of and consider the diverse views and needs of each group of managers in their dealings with union representatives.  2. As at GS-11, the unions are active in raising substantive issues in all phases of their dealings with management. However, at the GS- 12 level, the relationships between the unions and management are typically more difficult for the LR Specialist to deal with because of such factors as (1) the unions assume more of an adversary role, in that they are more likely to take a hard-line position on a variety of issues, with a significant number going through third-party procedures for resolution; (2) the local union officials often obtain the advice and assistance of professional, highly knowledgeable and sophisticated representatives from a national headquarters staff in negotiations and third-party proceedings; (3) there is a significant turnover in the organization's management and supervisory personnel an/or there is a general resistance by management to constructive bilateral consultation and cooperation (e.g., at an activity where many of the supervisors and managers are regularly transferred in and out, are relatively untrained in the area of labor-management relations, and are used to making unilateral decisions and having them carried out without question). 3. The typical problem dealt with by the GS-12 LR Specialist, whether in negotiations, agreement implementation, third-party proceedings, or other day-today contacts with union and management representatives are characterized by the following: S Precedent decisions and guidelines on controversial issues are often inapplicable or conflicting; Controversial issues frequently involve large numbers of employees, rather than just a few; Issues frequently have a potentially serious impact on mission accomplishment, the organization's budget, etc.; Problems to be resolved (e.g., unfair labor practice charges, grievances under a negotiated procedure) often are complex in that they involve several inter-related sub-problems that must be considered in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution to the larger question; The local organization is considered by the unions to be a ""lead"" activity in the area or in the agency, requiring the LRS to be especially aware of the kinds of issues that would serve as undesirable precedents for bargaining at other activities.  S S S  S  Main Menu  Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233 Typical of such problems and issues, when they generally meet the above criteria, are: S  Page22  Unit determination in which management and union disagree on the appropriateness of the unit - at the GS-12 level, the situation has significant elements that are unique and therefore require considerable judgement and originality to relate existing precedent to the specific case in justifying management's views.  Number and length of rest periods, and length of clean-up time required when a large number of employees are involved. thus making the issues potentially very costly to the organization. An unfair labor practice charge alleging the elimination of certain jobs in the unit for the express purpose of separating union officers for their union activities. Grievance arbitration concerning the propriety of a promotion action which could result in corrective action involving the promotion of the grieving party with a large amount of back pay and the reduction in grade of one or more employees that were promoted inappropriately.     4. GS-12 LR Specialists are recognized for their technical competence and soundness of judgment in LR matters. For example, they may be assigned to serve as the principal spokesman of a management negotiating committee involved in agreement negotiations for bargaining units with complexities typical of the GS-11 level, or, if not spokesman, their views and recommendations on management positions and negotiating techniques for more difficult negotiations have a major impact on the approaches taken by the committee. This same level of participation is also true for third-party proceedings such as unfair labor practice hearings, arbitration hearings, etc. Similarly, their views are heavily relied on in making decisions as to whether to take a grievance to arbitration and other of similar significance.  Level of Responsibility GS-12 Labor Relations Specialists receive assignments in terms of broad objectives and are expected to plan and carry out their work independently. Whereas GS-11 LR Specialists receive assistance from the supervisor on difficult and controversial problems, GS-12 Specialists resolve most such problems independently except for those of a policy nature. Although work is seldom, if ever, reviewed in progress, the supervisor is kept informed regarding sensitive issues and other matters of interest. The completed work of a GS-12 LR Specialist is reviewed for results attained and conformance with the overall policies and objectives of the activity and the agency. Personal contacts, in addition to those described for GS-11, include consultation and negotiation with officials and district or regional representatives of the national headquarters of unions as well as those of the unions locals; frequent advice and assistance to top management of the local organization on unusually difficult and highly controversial problems; and discussions with representatives of policy-making agencies (such as the US. Office of Personnel Management, and Main Menu Exit   Labor Relations, GS-0233  Page23  Office of the assistant Secretary of Labor/Labor Management Relations) and LR Specialists from other agencies also on controversial issues and on the application of conflicting or vaguely applicable precedents to difficult problems. As at GS-11, LR Specialists at this level take part in third-party proceedings as a technical advisor to a management representative who is making the presentation of the agency's position; or, at times as the spokesman for the activity. However, at GS-12, the issues are more complex requiring a greater degree of judgment and knowledge in presenting management's position effectively and in rebutting the union's arguments.

GX248-29-1451095	"Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project  Oversight Coordination Commission   Commission Summary Report September 2000       Contents   Background   The Oversight Coordination Commission   Summary of Work   Conclusion               THE OVERSIGHT COORDINATION COMMISSION     JOINT PROJECTS AND COORDINATION INITIATIVES   ACTIVITIES AIMED AT COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION      JOINT PROJECTS AND COORDINATION INITIATIVES    The following examples were among the initiatives originally contemplated in the Supplemental Plan. Several of these jointly coordinated undertakings spanned 1997 through 1999, while others were not launched until late 1999 and will continue through the end of the CA/T Project.      The OAG continues to refer to the OSA and OIG, as appropriate, complainant allegations that suggest potential weaknesses in design and construction management systems or fraud, waste, and abuse, but are not suitable for civil or criminal prosecutions      The OAG advises Commission members on legislative initiatives related to strengthening civil and criminal penalties.      The OAG has been instrumental in pusing passage of the False Claims Act, which will allow allegations and information under seal with the court to be shared among the OAG, OSA, and OIG.      The OAG has requested and received assistance from the OIG in interoreting aspects of the CA/T Project's mangement reporting system, including elements relating to claims and changes. The OIG has also remained available to assist the OAG in its extensive prevailing wage initiative and has provided in-depth background information on CA/T Project vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse based, in part, on the OIG's ongoing efforts to review and monitor contracts at construction sites.      On the basis of problems revealed during inspections at various construction work sites, the OIG advised the OAG that shortcomings in CA/T Project documentation could undercut the success of future civil litigation. This information supported ongoing efforts by the OAG toward effective documentation by CA/T Project staff.      The OSA issued a report in 2000 concerning CA/T Project work at Fort Point Channel including aspects that were candidates for cost recovery action. The OSA signaled its willingness to share material obtained during its review with the OIG, which had an ongoing interest in the cost recovery program. Since 1997, as part of the Commission start-up effort, the OAG and the OIG have periodically joined forces to help ensure that the CA/T Project was effectively pursuing legitimate claims against contractors and consultants through the cost recovery program.      After receiving complaints, and before launching independent investigations, the OAG often times consults with the OIG and OSA to determine whether either office might have received the same complaints. For example, the OIG recently advised the OAG that the OIG had already obtained certain documents and conducted interviews regarding a matter. By reviewing documents previously obtained by the Inspector General, the OAG was able to conduct a more efficient and effective resolution of the matter.      During the 1999, staff of the Offices of the State Auditor and the Inspector General began to discuss the potential for a coordinated review of CA/T Project force accounts in anticipation of additional oversight resources. Planning commenced in 2000. Early in the life of the Commission, all three members had expressed interest in the contractor payment process, including so-called force accounts (agreements by which a utility or othr entity uses its own costs). In 1997, the Commission agencies curtailed work until the U.S Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOTIG) had completed a review.      Consistent with its long-standing concern over the vulnerabilities of the contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and B/PB, the OIG launched another in a series of reviews aimed at recommending changes that increase the likelihood that B/PB would be held accountable for its work. The OAG and the OSA collaborate with, and assist the OIG's ongoing initiatives in this arena.      The OIG's staff continued to be available to brief legislative staff on CA/T Project-related issues and to assist legislative and Commission member staff in understanding the vulnerabilities of the contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and B/PB.      During discussions of oversight target areas, the agencies discovered that each had an interest in the CA/T Project's insurance program. In 1997, the member agencies agreed that the OSA would take the lead. The OSA, in addition to publishing reports on the topic of insurance and savings opportunities, has ensured that federal oversight agencies received full access to files and staff involved with various reviews. in 199, the OIG provided to OSA staff additional documents obtained in a separate but related case.      In three cases that included, but were not limited to, potential violations of the public bidding laws, the OIG briefed the OAG on the issues and sought input from those OAG staff charged with enforcing the applicable lawsr.      Because of the expertise developed during its decade-long monitoring effort and engineering resources, the OIG continues to provide assistance to Commission members on topics ranging from documenting the legislative history of transportation bond bills to interpreting technical reports generated by the CA/T Project to providing assistance in policy analysis and management reviews.      The OIG also alerted the Commission that the CA/T Project Finance Plan, which was due by statute to the Legilature in September 1999, was long overdue. The plan was not provided to the oversight agencies until February 2000, despite numerous inquiries from the OIG.      With the agreement of the other Commission members, the OIG entered into a memorandum of understanding with Commission member staff, including the Executive Director, to assist in ongoing reviewss of financial-related issues while still maintaining the integrityof the OIG's work under confidentiality requirements of M.G.L c.12A.      The OAG intends to enter into a written understanding with the Executive Director for proactive involvement and assistance with cases, investigations and/or analysis of OAG matters.      The OIG in fiscal year 2000 continued to pay for the Commission's administrative expenses, including salary of the legislatively mandated Executive Director position, from the remainder of the OIG's portions of the original $2 million allocated in 1996 for additional oversight by all three agencies. As was noted in the transmittal letter to this summary report, however, the three Commission agencies have decided to share the responsibility for administrative and personnel costs of the Commission including the salary of the Executive Director according to a fair and reasonable apportionment based on each office's allotted individual shares of the FY 2001 and the future Transportation Bond Bill monies.           ACTIVITIES AIMED AT COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION    The Commission functions as a forum through which its members can communicate ideas, share information, and coordinate oversight activities. The individual members, however, are sensitive to their respective agency's confidentiality obligations at all times.  Mindful of this requirement, the following summarizes the activities of the Commission that were facilitated by the Commission's staff during the past year.     Quarterly Coordinating Sessions    Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Commission schedules a coordinating session on at least a quarterly basis and includes the Senate and House Chairpersons of the Joint Committee on Transportation and the Chairpersons of the Senate and House Committees on Post Audit and Oversight, or their designees.  Discussion during the meetings revolves around information exchange, case coordination, and updates on legislative initiatives.    The Commission held the following coordinating sessions:     June 30, 1999:  The first quarterly coordinating session for the third year focused on legislative comments and updates regarding the Transportation Bond Bill, and the False Claims Act. Commission members spoke of a follow-up review of the Wrap-Up Insurance Program Report and meetings with the DOTIG on the matter, the draftof the Fort Point Channel Report, the assessment of mitigation activities, the review of Vent Building #8, the follow-up on previous reports of the CA/T Project internal audit functions, technical assisstance to the CA/T Project in reviewing the ""integrated project organization"" as a result of the Metropolitan Highway System Bill, a Supreme Judicial Court decision on behalf of the Commonwealth against a bill board company, eminent domain cases that have saved the Commonwealth $109 million, the Hotline and its posters, site tours, and the website. A letter was sent to the new CA/T Project Director introducing the Commission and inviting the CA/T Project Director to suggest any areas where powers and expertise of the Commission's member offices could be employed most productively and where the CA/T Project might be particularly vulnerable to fraud and abuse.       September 29, 1999:  During the second quarterly coordinating session, Commission members were briefed by a representative from the OIG who explained the findings of the OIG's review of the East Boston Toll Facility. Issues of concern included cost containment, overall cost, toll canopy cost, life cycle analysis, design calculations, and wind tunnel testing. As a result of the review, the CA/T Project initiated design changes that will save the CA/T Project an estimated $1.1 million. The OSA reviewed the CA/T Project's mitigation practices at the request of the CA/T Project. The OSA strongly recommended that controls over the mitigation process be put into place, as there was no centralized point where one could find out what was involved in mitigation costs and what costs have increased mitigation projects.  The OSA also discussed the status of the Fort Point Channel review, phase II of the Wrap-Up Insurance Program, and the State Street to North Street construction contract (C17AC).  Other topics discussed included information sharing, site tours, and the web page. Legislative comments and updates pertained to the status of the Transportation Bond Bill.      January 11, 2000:  The third quarterly coordinating session dealt with Commission members' overview of the work of their offices.  Areas included the status of the Wrap-Up Insurance Program review, the possible review of force accounts, the slow flow of information from the CA/T Project, CA/T Project technical assistance, agency coordination, legislatively mandated reviews, the OCC web page, and the megaproject questionnaire. Legislative comments and updates pertained to the Transportation Bond Bill.      March 28, 2000:  During the fourth quarterly coordinating session, Commission members summarized their oversight activities during the past quarter. On February 24, 2000 the Commission attended a cost containment briefing presented by FHWA and MTA. The presentation focused on the value engineering program, design to cost/budget program, schedule initiatives program, partnering, operation and maintenance reviews, and constructability reviews. Members also spoke about matters including the OSA Wrap-Up Insurance Report II, the I-93 to Atlantic Avenue construction contract (C11A1), CA/T Project expenses, the State and Road Bridge Program, funding for OCC staff, the MTA Finance Plan (October 1999), the CA/T Project cost overrun, meetings with the Federal Task Force representatives, sharing of work among the offices, the Big Dig Hotline, and prevailing wages.  Legislative comments included a status report on the False Claim Act.           Communication    In order to keep Commission members current on the CA/T Project developments and related matters each week, the Executive Director delivers timely informational material.  Materials include reports, journals, articles, newspaper clippings, audio and videotapes, photographs, announcements, briefings, and correspondence generated by staff in the previous week relating to the CA/T Project.  Conversations with Commission members occur on a regular basis, and the Executive Director meets regularly with the CA/T Project's staff assigned to deal with the oversight agencies. A primary purpose of the Commission is to ensure that the member agencies coordinate their work on the CA/T Project.  To achieve this goal, senior staff from each office regularly discuss pending CA/T Project matters, issues of mutual concern, and within the confidentiality constraints of each of their offices, their work and objectives on CA/T Project issues.      Megaproject Questionnaire    The Commission is in the process of drafting a compendium of the ways in which other states use oversight activities in the prevention and detection of waste, fraud, and abuse. The information is being gathered from a questionnaire, which was developed by the staff of the Commission after conducting research, placing telephone calls, and preparing and field testing questions. To date, the questionnaire has been distributed to approximately twenty other ""mega"" (over $1 billion) public construction projects throughout the United States. Of the twenty questionnaires mailed, eight questionnaires were returned completed, three questionnaires were returned blank, and eleven recipients did not respond.    The data from the survey will be used to:         Detail how other states are managing oversight by describing the organizations and their operational objectives and goals.     Document each respondent agency's assessment of the oversight effort, including programs and activities found to be particularly useful.     Learn from the experiences of other oversight programs and apply them to efforts on the CA/T Project.        A report analyzing the results and highlighting insights gleaned from other jurisdictions will be presented to Commission members.      CA/T Project Briefings & Site Tours    The Commission has charged the Executive Director with scheduling site tours and CA/T Project briefings.  Briefings have been on a broad range of matters including the CA/T Project's insurance program, force accounts, the material disposal program, the FHWA ""lessons learned"" program, incentive contracts, and cost containment.  To date, Commission members have toured the Ted Williams Tunnel, Atlantic Avenue (slurry wall construction and Red Line underpinning), Fort Point Channel (casting basin, soil mixing and freezing, tunnel jacking, and Amtrak operations), State Street (Blue Line), Vent Buildings Nos. 3 and 6, South Boston Bypass Road, Haul Road, Governor's Island, Subaru Pier, Quarry Hills, Airport Construction, Leverett Circle, Storrow Drive Connector Bridge, Charles River Crossing, Southeast Expressway, and Spectacle Island.     Database    The Commission staff is responsible for maintaining in a central location a database and library of all published documents pertaining to the CA/T Project and makes full use of the Internet for gathering such material.     Website    The Commission is in the process of designing a website.  The website will be part of the state system and is intended to educate readers about the Commission.  Information will include the legislative history of the Commission, links to member agencies (OAG, OSA, and OIG), the Hotline, and the Commission's Summary Reports.  The address for the Commission's website will be  http://www.state.ma.us/catocc .       next section:  Summary of Work (1999-00)            [ Commission ] [ Attorney General ]  [ State Auditor ]  [ Inspector General ]  [ Big Dig Fraud Hotline ]"

If you wish to discuss the final report, please call me or have your staff contact Steven L. Schaeffer, Assistant Inspector General for Audit, at (410) 965-9700.  James G. Huse, Jr. Attachment   OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION OF THE USE OF OFFICIAL TIME FOR UNION ACTIVITIES AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION June 2002 A-13-01-11005   Mission We improve SSA programs and operations and protect them against fraud, waste, and abuse by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations. We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Administration officials, the Congress, and the public.  Authority The Inspector General Act created independent audit and investigative units, called the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The mission of the OIG, as spelled out in the Act, is to: m Conduct and supervise independent and objective audits and investigations relating to agency programs and operations. m Promote economy, effectiveness, and efficiency within the agency. m Prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in agency programs and operations. m Review and make recommendations regarding existing and proposed legislation and regulations relating to agency programs and operations. m Keep the agency head and the Congress fully and currently informed of problems in agency programs and operations. To ensure objectivity, the IG Act empowers the IG with: m Independence to determine what reviews to perform. m Access to all information necessary for the reviews. m Authority to publish findings and recommendations based on the reviews.  Vision By conducting independent and objective audits, investigations, and evaluations, we are agents of positive change striving for continuous improvement in the Social Security Administration's programs, operations, and management and in our own office.   Executiv e Summary OBJECTIVE The objective of our review was to assess the corrective actions the Social Security Administration (SSA) has taken to address recommendations in our July 1998 report, Use of Official time for Union Activities at the Social Security Administration (A-13-97-72013). Specifically, we examined the actions SSA took to improve the recording and reporting of official time1 and SSA's related management oversight.  B ACKGROUND In June 1996, the House Committee on W ays and Means conducted hearings on labor union activities at SSA. During the hearings, the General Accounting Office provided the results of its review of the time and costs associated with union activities at SSA. Based on its limited verification of hours spent on union activities as reported by SSA, the General Accounting Office reported that official time was underreported. The General Accounting Office testified that ""...it is not possible to estimate the actual time spent agencywide for any reporting period because of limitations in SSA's reporting systems.""2 Consequently, Congress requested that we provide a more in-depth examination of the use of official time and associated costs. In 1998, we reported the results of our audit of SSA's Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 official time use and costs. We concluded that management oversight weaknesses and problems associated with SSA's processing and reporting of official time prevented the Agency from producing reliable reports. W e made specific recommendations for improving the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time (Appendix A). In March 2000, we responded to a request from the Committee on W ays and Means, Subcommittee on Social Security, concerning the status of corrective actions SSA had taken to address our 1998 report. As part of our response, we informed the Subcommittee that we would initiate a follow-up review of SSA's reported corrective actions. We reviewed actions taken in response to 8 of 10 recommendations.3 Since the Agency was limited in its ability to respond to one recommendation and did not agree with the other recommendation, we did not review SSA's actions related to these matters. This report provides the results of our follow-up review.  1  Official time is granted by negotiation of a bargaining agreement for time during which an SSA employee is performing union-related activities rather than performing Agency-assigned work. GAO/HEHS-97-3 report.  2 3  Of the 10 recommendations contained in the report, we reviewed Agenc y actions intended to address report recommendations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. i  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   Each year, as requested by the House Appropriations Committee Report 105-205, Federal agencies report labor union-related activities and costs to Congress. In FY 2000, SSA reported that it used about 403,500 official time hours for union-related activities at a cost of approximately $13.5 million. The Agency also reported that 1,864 union representatives used official time. Of these, 127 union representatives ""spent 100 percent of their time on union activities.""4 SSA's Oversight of Official Time Use The Office of Labor-Management and Employee Relations (OLMER) within the Deputy Commissioner's Office of Human Resources at SSA Headquarters administers the Agency's labor-management and employee relations program. OLMER also represents the Agency in labor union negotiations; develops Agency-wide policies and procedures for the use of official time; oversees the recording, reporting, and management of official time; and reports official time use and costs to Congress.  RESULTS OF REVIEW SSA took action to address certain recommendations contained in our July 1998 report, Use of Official time for Union Activities at the Social Security Administration (A-13-97-72013). Although SSA has taken action to address the recommendation concerning the retention of official time records, the Agency's policy did not comply with Federal requirements.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION SSA has taken action to address our July 1998 recommendations to improve the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time use. For example, the Agency created a special team to provide management oversight of official time. Such actions indicate the Agency continues to make progress toward improving its accountability of official time use and costs. Although SSA did take action to address our recommendations, a noteworthy deficiency still exists concerning the retention of official time records. The Agency's policy for the retention of time and attendance records should comply with Federal requirements. Consequently, we recommend that SSA: 1. Update its policies to comply with Federal requirements to ensure that time and attendance records are retained for 6 years.  4  An employee using official time to perform representational activities for 75 percent or more of all work hours is considered a full-time union representative. ii  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   AGENCY COMMENTS SSA agreed with our recommendation. In addition, the Agency provided technical and editorial comments. The full text of the Agency's comments is included in Appendix C.  OIG RESPONSE We reviewed the Agency's formal comments and agree with the editorial changes. In addition, we agree in part, with the technical comments related to the Other Matters and have made the appropriate changes. SSA stated in its technical comments that its record retention schedules are in full compliance with the National Archives and Record Administration's guidelines that Time and Attendance rosters be kept 6 years. Further, the Agency stated that it maintains its retention schedules in the Operational and Administrative Records Schedules System (OARS) on the SSA Digital Library (http://library.ba.ssa.gov/quicklist.htm). W e were unable to verify this information. Moreover, the Agency stated that the problem cited in our report refers to an addendum made to the 1998 Official Time/Partnership Yearbook instructing supervisors of Union Representatives to maintain official time forms for 3 years. W e disagree with the Agency. W e based our review on the Agency's records retention policy for time and attendance, which is denoted in the Department of Health and Human Services' Guide for Timekeepers. During our review, staff in the Center for Policy and Staffing, within the Office of Personnel Operations, identified the Department of Health and Human Services' Guide as containing the Agency's official time and attendance record retention policy.

Specifically, we examined the actions SSA took to improve the recording and reporting of official time and SSA's related management oversight.  B ACKGROUND In June 1996, the House Committee on W ays and Means conducted hearings on labor union activities at SSA. During the hearings, the General Accounting Office testified that ""... SSA underreported the official time spent on union activities. Further, it is not possible to estimate the actual time spent Agencywide for any reporting period because of limitations in SSA's reporting systems.""5 Consequently, Congress requested that we provide a more in-depth examination of the use of official time and associated costs. In 1998, we reported the results of our audit of SSA's Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 official time use and costs. We concluded that management oversight weaknesses and problems associated with SSA's processing and reporting of official time prevented the Agency from producing reliable reports. W e made specific recommendations for improving the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time (Appendix A). In March 2000, we responded to a request from the Committee on W ays and Means, Subcommittee on Social Security, concerning the status of corrective actions SSA had taken to address our 1998 report. As part of our response, we informed the Subcommittee that we would initiate a follow-up review of SSA's reported corrective actions. Each year, as requested by the House Appropriations Committee Report 105-205, Federal agencies report labor union-related activities and costs to Congress. In FY 2000, SSA reported that it used about 403,500 official time hours for union-related activities at a cost of approximately $13.5 million. The Agency also reported that 1,864 union representatives (UR) used official time. Of these, 127 employees ""spent 100 percent of their time on union activities.""6  5 6  GAO/HEHS-97-3 report.  An employee using official time to perform representational activities for 75 percent or more of all work hours is considered a full-time UR. 1  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   Unions at SSA The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)7 authorized official time use and provided a basis for Federal agency and labor unions to negotiate collective bargaining agreements. The CSRA:  gives employees a statutory right to use official time to attend contract negotiations and negotiate whether labor URs are granted official time for other labor and management activities, such as conducting and receiving training; permits Federal agencies to provide the labor unions routine services and facilities at the agency's expense; and prohibits official time use for internal union business, such as soliciting members.     SSA employees are represented by four labor unions. Each union's collective bargaining agreement specifies the number of URs it is allowed. As of December 2000, SSA had a total of 2,462 URs. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has 2,283 URs, Association of Administrative Law Judges/International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers has 147 URs, National Treasury Employees Union has 31 URs, and National Federation of Federal Employees has 1 UR. Use of official time is limited to URs. SSA's Oversight of Official Time Use The Office of Labor, Management, and Employee Relations (OLMER) within the Deputy Commissioner's Office of Human Resources at SSA Headquarters administers the Agency's labor-management and employee relations program. OLMER also represents the Agency in labor union negotiations; develops Agency-wide policies and procedures for the use of official time; and oversees the recording, reporting, and management of official time and reports official time use and costs to Congress. Before 1998, SSA used variations of a manual reporting process to report official time use and costs. In 1996, SSA piloted the Official Union Time Tracking System (OUTTS). OUTTS is an automated information system intended to track the use of official time. For example, the system tracks bank8 and non-bank9 official time hours; monitors URs' use of official time for certain activities, and generates management reports. In 7 8  5 U.S.C.  7101 et seq. (2001).  ""Bank time"" is official time that is allocated for certain representational activities based on a negotiated bargaining agreement between SSA and the union(s). 9  ""Non-bank time"" is official time that may be used for union activities based on a negotiated bargaining agreement without a cap or limit on the amount of time that can be used by the UR.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  2   July 1998, SSA and AFGE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to use OUTTS for recording the official time use of URs located in field offices and teleservice centers. An electronic spreadsheet was used to capture official time by the other Agency components (SSA Headquarter offices, program service centers, and the Offices of Hearings and Appeals) to record and report the use of official time. On May 10, 2001, SSA and AFGE signed another MOU. It expanded the use of OUTTS for recording and reporting official time use of AFGE-designated URs in all Agency components. As of December 2000, AFGE-designated URs represented 76 percent of all Agency URs. The remaining 24 percent of the Agency's URs'10 official time use was recorded and reported using the electronic spreadsheet. Recording and Reporting of Official Time Use OLMER uses labor relations specialists (LRS) and liaisons (LRL) to oversee the recording, reporting, and management of official time use within SSA. LRS are located in Agency regional offices (RO) and verify and report the use of official time for the field offices and teleservice centers using OUTTS. LRLs are located at other Agency locations and record and report official time use by utilizing the electronic spreadsheet. Both OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet process require URs to submit official time forms11 to their supervisors for review and approval when they use official time. As of the date of our review, there were three official time forms in use.12 The location and/or labor union affiliation of the UR determines which form is used. After the supervisor approves the official time form, appropriate information is subsequently entered into either OUTTS or the electronic spreadsheet, whichever system is used. For official time reporting using OUTTS, OLMER relies on the LRS in the RO to check the accuracy of information reported by the field offices and teleservice centers. Fifteen days upon the end of each fiscal quarter, OLMER provides the LRS with an OUTTSgenerated summary report containing official time use for that quarter.13 OLMER requests that this information be reviewed for accuracy. Each RO uses whatever process it has developed to verify official time use. Once the review is complete, the LRS signs and sends a response to OLMER verifying the accuracy of the report. These are URs for the Association of Administrative Law Judges/International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers; National Treasury Employees Union; and National Federation of Federal Employees. The MOU signed on May 10, 2001 also included an agreement to develop an electronic official time form to eliminate the use of multiple paper forms. No specific time was designated in the MOU for implementation of the electronic official time use form. URs use an official time form to report official time activity. The form numbers are SSA-75-U4, SSA-75-U4-F and SSA-478. 13 12 10  11  Supervisors can input and edit data entered into OUTTS until the 15 day of the month following the close of the quarter. 3  th  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   When the electronic spreadsheet is used to report official time use, OLMER relies on LRLs in the non-field office components to check the accuracy of information contained on the spreadsheet. Within 10 days of the end of each fiscal quarter, LRLs in non-field office components are notified via e-mail to review reported official time use. Attached to the e-mail are (1) an electronic spreadsheet with a UR listing; (2) a form identifying various official time information to be reported; and (3) instructions for the completion of the quarterly report spreadsheet. The LRLs are instructed to enter data, total official time hours reported, and verify active URs. The completed documents are electronically sent to OLMER. After 15 days upon the close of the quarter, OLMER is the only entity authorized to make changes to reported official time in the OUTTS system. If changes are necessary, the appropriate field office routes the documentation through the regional office with the requested changes. OLMER makes all adjustments to the official time use reported during the fourth quarter of the FY.14  SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY To assess the corrective actions taken to address recommendations in our July 1998 report related to recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time, we reviewed applicable laws, policies, procedures, internal reports, and external reports. In addition, we took the following actions.  We interviewed personnel in SSA's OLMER and the Office of Information Management Systems to obtain information concerning actions taken by SSA to address prior audit report recommendations. We also obtained information about the policies, procedures, and practices used in the recording, reporting, and management of official time use. We visited a district office in Baltimore, Maryland.15 We interviewed staff and observed activities related to the recording and reporting of official time use. W e also reviewed a random sample of completed official time forms, observed the process for recording official time use in OUTTS, and assessed the record retention of official time forms. We assessed the information generated from OUTTS to determine whether the system was able to provide an accurate list of current URs and coding of official time activities; verify official time data are entered; and confirm official time data entries are made for union officers. Of the 127 URs that spent 75 percent or more of their      The same process is used for both OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet to request changes and make adjustments to reported official time use. 15  14  W e selected this SSA office based on proximity to SSA's Headquarters.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  4   time on union activities during FY 2000, we selected a random sample of 30 URs16 to review. For our sample, we matched the official time form information for the fourth quarter of FY 2000 with official time use reported in OUTTS.17 We used common business orientation language (COBOL) computer programs to match the OUTTS data files and extract pertinent information.18  We reviewed procedures used to implement the OUTTS system. For example, we reviewed SSA's validation procedures used for implementing OUTTS requirements. We also examined SSA's authentication of procedures used to accumulate data in OUTTS, and we reviewed the testing of the functional requirements and enhancements. We obtained and reviewed policies and procedures that were issued in response to related 1998 audit report recommendations, b a r g a i n i n g a g r e e m e n t s , Official Time/Partnership Activities Yearbook  1998, and reports issued annually to Congress concerning o f f i c i a l t i m e u s e a n d c o s t s .    The work we performed during our review was limited to certain recommendations in our 1998 report.19 We did not assess corrective actions taken to determine whether official time is being used for appropriate activities and amounts of time20 or the recording and reporting of ""Partnership time"" as official time.21 In addition, we did not perform work related to allegations or suspicions of official time abuse. We conducted this review in Baltimore, Maryland. The entity reviewed was OLMER within the Deputy Commissioner's Office of Human Resources. W e performed our review from March 2001 through June 2001 in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspections issued by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency.  16 17  See Appendix B for information concerning the sampling methodology used.  The names of full-time URs and their profile, for example, location, allocated bank hours, used bank hours, and affiliations, are examples of information used for our match. COBOL Program 1 matched OUTTS' ""UR"" files with its ""name"" file. COBOL Program 2 matched the output from program 1 with OUTTS' ""profile"" and ""bank files."" COBOL Program 3 matched the output from Program 2 to the OUTTS' ""activity file."" 19 20 18  See Appendix A. Recommendations 2 and 9 in the 1998 Report were not addressed in this report.  Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute and decisions and the Agency's collective bargaining agreement restricts management discretion in approving or denying official time requests. Management's authority to elicit detailed information concerning requests for official time use is limited. SSA did not agree with this recommendation. Before the release of our 1998 report, the Commissioner determined that time spent on Partnership activities should not be considered official time. The Commissioner's decision was based on the premise that Partnership activities do not constitute the type of representational activity defined in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute. 21  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  5   Re sult s of R e vi ew SSA took action to address certain recommendations in our July 1998 report, Use of Official time for Union Activities at the Social Security Administration (A-13-97-72013). Of the 10 recommendations contained in the report, we reviewed Agency actions intended to address report recommendations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Although SSA has taken action to address the recommendation concerning the retention of official time records, the Agency's policy did not comply with Federal requirements.  Agency Had Taken Action To Address Certain Report Recommendations Our 1998 report identified several deficiencies related to the recording and reporting of official time information. In the report, we stated these weaknesses prevented us from determining whether official time use and costs were accurately reported to Congress. We made 10 specific recommendations for improving the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time. Of these, highlights of eight recommendations as well as a description of the Agency's corrective actions taken to address the recommendations follow. SSA took action concerning recording and reporting of official time Recommendation 1: Improve official time information. W e determined that SSA was maintaining an accurate, up-to-date list of URs.22 For the fourth quarter of FY 2000, we determined that the number of URs did not exceed the limitations specified in the bargaining agreements between SSA and the labor unions. Recommendation 3: Monitor the coding or categorizing of the type of UR activity so activities that have limits are not improperly reported as an unlimited activity. Before the release of our July 1998 report, SSA issued a memorandum to its supervisors instructing supervisors to monitor URs' coding/categorizing of union-related activities to prevent exceeding limits on certain activities. In addition, the employee unions' collective bargaining agreements specify that the supervisor should receive sufficient general information when official time is used, to ensure the activity is one for which official time would be authorized. However, URs are not required to discuss details of the activity with the supervisor. We verified that OUTTS monitors the limits placed on official time use by national, regional and local allocations. OUTTS can issue alerts to supervisors when URs are close to exhausting the allocation of official time available for use. W e did not determine whether all supervisors using the electronic spreadsheet for recording and W e did not perform procedures to determine whether only authorized URs received supervisory approval for the use of official time. 6 22  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   reporting of official time use complied with the guidance for monitoring URs' coding/categorizing of union-related activities. Review of official time use by the URs in our sample using OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet indicated all were within the limitations specified for official time use. In addition, the Program Analysis and Research Team (PART) conducts periodic official time reviews of Agency components reporting official time use. SSA established PART to provide management oversight of the Agency's official time use. As an oversight function, PART examines a sample of official time forms for accuracy and interviews the supervisors concerning official time reporting issues. Recommendation 4: Improve procedures to ensure that allegations or suspicions of abuse are resolved in a timely manner. After the issuance of our report, SSA negotiated collective bargaining agreements that contain provisions for handling allegations and suspicions of abuse. OLMER reports it relies on the bargaining agreement provisions to administer the process for handling such allegations or suspicions. Further, the Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources issued guidance to reinforce bargaining agreement provisions dealing with official time issues and suspicions or allegations of official time abuse. The guidance established a process for discussing such allegations and advising supervisors of the disposition of their referrals of suspected abuse situations. Recommendation 5: As recommended, OUTTS can confirm receipt of official time recorded within the system. However, SSA relies on LRLs to ensure that official time use is accurately entered onto the electronic spreadsheet. Upon the close of each FY quarter, PART forwards official time use reports to LRLs. After reviewing the reports, policy requires that LRS and LRLs notify PART of any adjustments to the official time recorded in OUTTS or on the electronic spreadsheet. As previously stated, PART is the only entity authorized to make changes in reported official time after the close of the FY quarter. If changes are needed, PART makes all requested adjustments to official time at the end of the FY. W hen PART reviews information contained in the OUTTSgenerated or electronic spreadsheet-generated quarterly reports, the LRS and LRLs are contacted if official time use is not reported. Recommendation 6: Improve controls to ensure that official time records are accurately summarized and reported. SSA implemented OUTTS to track the time URs spent on union activities. W hen OUTTS is used to record and report official time use, PART issues OUTTS-generated summary reports for the fiscal quarter to the LRS. Also, at the end of the FY, reports containing all official time use and adjustments for the FY are issued to the LRS for review. To determine whether the information contained in the reports is accurate, the LRS are asked to reconcile information contained in the report with official time records. After reconciling the information, the LRS' notify PART of any needed adjustments.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  7   For OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet process, OLMER states that each location uses its own, self-developed process for the reconciliating of the summary report. Recommendation 8: We also recommended in our 1998 report that SSA develop policies and procedures to ensure official time is consistently reported for union officers. In August 1998, SSA and AFGE signed an MOU requiring union officers to complete an official time form each week. OLMER reports the official time use of URs, including union officers, on a quarterly basis to SSA's Office of Budget, Division of Finance. The Division of Finance uses this information to calculate the Agency's cost for the use of official time. Recommendation 10: In our 1998 report, we recommended that SSA establish a mechanism to evaluate official time use benefits, disadvantages, and impact on service to the public. SSA complied with the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) request for Calendar Year 1998 official time data by using OLMER's information for compiling and reporting official time use. Further, SSA's management stated that OLMER's system for collecting and reporting official time use enables the evaluation of official time use benefits and its impact on the Agency's service to the public. In its 1998 report to OPM, SSA did not report any disadvantages regarding the use of official time. In reviewing SSA's annual reports to Congress from FY 1998 to FY 2000, we found the Agency has complied with certain reporting requirements.23 SSA provided information on official time costs associated with union activities, the benefits of official time use, and information concerning official time use affecting service to the public. However, we did not find disadvantages of official time use included in any documentation or statements provided to Congress. W e did not independently verify the accuracy of the information reported to OPM in November 1998 or the information reported to Congress from 1998 to 2000.  As requested by the House Appropriations Committee Report 105-205, SSA submits an annual report to Congress on official time use and costs of union activities.  23  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  8   In August 1999, SSA established PART to provide management oversight of the Agency's official time use. PART issues official time policies and procedures and is responsible for compiling and reporting SSA's official time use and costs to Congress. In addition, PART conducts monthly teleconference discussions24 with LRS and LRLs about official time recording and reporting and performs periodic reviews (Official Time Reviews)25 of official time use. SSA created a special team to oversee official time use When performing its ad hoc reviews, PART examines completed official time forms and conducts interviews with supervisors. The Team documents its findings and makes recommendations to improve any detected deficiencies. If recurring errors are detected, PART reviews the recording and reporting of specific offices' official time use. During our review, we observed a PART teleconference discussion and reviewed Official Time Review reports for FYs 1999 through 2001. The monthly teleconference calls provide an efficient way to convey current information on official time use and discuss relevant union-related issues. In addition, the Reviews provide SSA management an assessment of official time use and offer recommendations to improve cited deficiencies.  SSA's Record Retention Policy Did Not Comply With Federal Requirements Although SSA took action to address our July 1998 recommendations to improve the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time use, a noteworthy deficiency still exists concerning the retention of official time records. In our 1998 report, we recommended that SSA establish a uniform retention policy for official time records. At that time, we stated that documents needed to be maintained to verify data on official time records and may be necessary to resolve any allegations or suspicion of misuse. In 1999, to reinforce SSA's official time use record retention policy, OLMER issued an addendum to the 1998 Official Time/Partnership Yearbook.26 The Yearbook required supervisors of URs to maintain official time forms for a 3-year period or for longer periods of time, if litigation is pending on the issue or if the matter is in the administrative PART schedules monthly conference calls with all LRSs and the LRLs to discuss issues relating to official time use and the implementation of OUTTS, and it responds to any concerns relating to unionrelated activities. As of September 2001, PART has completed seven reviews. In FYs 1999 and 2000, three reviews and three follow-up reviews were completed in the same areas: (1) Headquarters, (2) Philadelphia region and (3) Chicago region. One review was conducted in FY 2001 in the Seattle regional office. 26 25 24  The Official Time/Partnership Activities Yearbook consolidated all policies and procedures on official time use into one central location. 9  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   or judicial process. The 3-year period for retaining the forms conformed to SSA's policy for the retention of time and attendance records. Within the Government, the preservation of records is critical to ensure that each agency's records contain accurate and complete documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the agency. The National Archives and Records Administration is responsible for establishing policies that govern the retention and destruction of Federal agencies' records. National Archives and Records Administration's policy, General Records Schedule 2, Payroll and Administration Records, Time and Attendance, sections 7 and 8, establishes Federal regulations for the retention and destruction of time and attendance records. The General Records Schedule 2 states that time and attendance documents and associated input records can be destroyed after a General Accounting Office audit is conducted, or when 6 years has expired, whichever occurs first. Although the addendum to the 1998 Official Time/Partnership Yearbook complied with SSA policy, SSA's policy for the retention of time and attendance records does not comply with Federal requirements concerning the retention of time and attendance documents and associated input records. As a result, the Agency may not be keeping official time records for the required period to substantiate official time use and costs.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  10   Conc lus i on and Recomm endation SSA has taken action to address our July 1998 recommendations to improve the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time use. For example, the Agency created a special team to provide management oversight of official time. Such actions indicate that the Agency continues to make progress toward improving its accountability of official time use and costs. Although SSA did take action to address our recommendations, a noteworthy deficiency still exists concerning the retention of official time records. The Agency's policy for the retention of time and attendance records should comply with Federal requirements. Consequently, we recommend that SSA: 1. Update its policies to comply with Federal requirements to ensure that time and attendance records are retained for 6 years.  AGENCY COMMENTS SSA agreed with our recommendation. In addition, the Agency provided technical and editorial comments. The full text of the Agency's comments is included in Appendix C.  OIG RESPONSE We reviewed the Agency's formal comments and agree with the editorial changes. In addition, we agree in part, with the technical comments related to the Other Matters and have made the appropriate changes. SSA stated in its technical comments that its record retention schedules are in full compliance with the National Archives and Record Administration's guidelines that Time and Attendance rosters be kept 6 years. Further, the Agency stated that it maintains its retention schedules in the Operational and Administrative Records Schedules System (OARS) on the SSA Digital Library (http://library.ba.ssa.gov/quicklist.htm). W e were unable to verify this information. Moreover, the Agency stated that the problem cited in our report refers to an addendum made to the 1998 Official Time/Partnership Yearbook instructing supervisors of Union Representatives to maintain official time forms for 3 years. W e disagree with the Agency. W e based our review on the Agency's records retention policy for time and attendance, which is denoted in the Department of Health and Human Services' Guide for Timekeepers. During our review, staff in the Center for Policy and Staffing, within the Office of Personnel Operations, identified the Department of Health and Human  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  11   Services' Guide as containing the Agency's official time and attendance record retention policy.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  12   Other Matters In 1998, we recommended that SSA improve its management controls to official time use is accurately summarized and reported. At that time, we SSA reconcile various official time information and identify duplicate repo time use. During this review, we determined that official time information when OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet process are used to record official time. ensure that suggested that rting of official is reconciled and report  Of the 30 URs included in our sample, we compared the FY 2000 fourth quarter official time forms (7,607 hours) for 22 URs to the official time use recorded in OUTTS (7,746 hours). We identified discrepancies in our comparison for 10 URs. For these URs, we identified the underreporting of 241 hours and the overreporting of 102 hours in OUTTS. W hen summed, these discrepancies resulted in a total of 139 hours of official time not reported. The estimated cost of these hours is about $4,000. For the same time period, we also compared official time forms to the electronic spreadsheet used to record and report official time for the remaining eight URs in our sample. W e identified 256 hours over reported on the spreadsheet. The estimated cost of these hours is approximately $7,000. As a result of the above discrepancies, about $11,000 (395 hours) in official time cost was incorrectly reported. Of this amount, the Agency overreported $7,000 in official time costs and underreported $4,000 in official time costs. During our comparison of the official time forms and the reported official time, we also noted the following.   Official time forms were missing for the period reviewed. Official time forms were not signed and authorized by the supervisor.  Although the discrepancies noted during our review are not significant, we are providing this information to SSA for its use in taking corrective actions, as it deems necessary and appropriate, to improve the accuracy of the official time costs reported to Congress.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  13   Appendices  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   Appendix A  Prior Office of the Inspector General Audit In 1998, we completed an audit on the Use of Official Time for Union Activities at the Social Security Administration (A-13-97-72013). W e concluded that management oversight weaknesses and problems associated with SSA's processing and reporting of official time prevented the Agency from producing reliable reports. W e made specific recommendations for improving the recording, reporting, and management oversight of official time. Listed below are the 1998 report recommendations. Recommendation 1 Maintain accurate, up-to-date listings of union representatives (UR), as required by the collective bargaining agreement to ensure that: a) Supervisors only approve requests for the use of official time for authorized URs. b) The number of authorized URs does not exceed the limitations specified in the collective bargaining agreements at any given time. Recommendation 2 Improve its management oversight to help determine whether official time is used for appropriate activities and appropriate amounts of time. To accomplish this objective, SSA should: a) Instruct supervisors to have official time forms filled out as precisely as possible using existing codes and sub-codes where applicable. If more diligent completion of the official time forms still does not enable supervisors to make an informed decision as to the appropriateness of the activity or the time requested or used for that activity, SSA should pursue revisions of the forms toward that end during negotiations on future collective bargaining agreements.  b) Instruct supervisors of National Treasury Employees Union URs to use the prescribed official time forms in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. c) Remind all supervisors that official time must be approved in advance of its usage.  d) Periodically verify a sample of official time used to ensure that official time records are accurate. A-1  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)   Recommendation 3 Monitor the coding or categorizing of the type of UR activity so that activities that have limits are not improperly reported as an unlimited activity. To accomplish this objective, SSA should require that information on the official time record specifying the type of activity be completed time be used, the user must specify the activity for which the official time is used, and periodically test such records for accuracy. Recommendation 4 Improve procedures to ensure that allegations or suspicions of abuse are resolved in a timely manner. Procedures should address time frames for union cooperation in providing requested documents, a specific document retention schedule for union copies of official time forms, and a process to address situations where time frames are not met or the union does not cooperate. Also, supervisors should be advised of the disposition of their referrals whenever appropriate. Recommendation 5 Improve controls to ensure that official time data are complete. There should be confirmation of receipt when official time reports are submitted. Also, a followup by appropriate labor relation's staff should be required for any period in which a report was not filed. Recommendation 6 Improve controls to ensure that official time records are accurately summarized and reported. SSA should: a) Reconcile individual official time records to summary reports and reconcile component and/or regional summary reports to the Agency-wide report before it is provided to the Office of Personnel Management and the Congress. b) Compare official time records that have been submitted by supervisors to any records that may have been previously reported or calculated into the totals to identify duplicate reporting of official time. c) Compare the official time records to the amounts summarized and entered in the automated system (YY system) for processing official time. Recommendation 7 Establish a uniform retention policy for official time records. These source documents need to be maintained to verify the data on official time records and may be necessary to resolve any allegations or suspicion of misuse.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  A-2   Recommendation 8 Develop policies and procedures to ensure official time is consistently reported for union officers. This will correct the inconsistent reporting which has caused an overstatement of the salary costs for some union officers. Recommendation 9 Revise its policies and procedures for recording Partnership Time so that URs, as well as SSA supervisors, know which of the activities should be reported as ""partnership"" or official time. Official time records should be revised to reflect these changes. Recommendation 10 To comply with Office of Personnel Management's request for Calendar Year 1998 data on official time, SSA should establish a mechanism to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of official time and its impact on SSA's service to the public.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  A-3   Appendix B  Sampling Methodology In Fiscal Year 2000, there were 1,864 union representatives (URs) who used official time. Of those, 127 URs spent 75 percent or more of all work hours using official time. We randomly selected 30 of the 127 URs for our sample. For the 30 URs, we reviewed the official time records and applicable data entries: 22 URs recording and reporting official time use in Official Union Time Tracking System (OUTTS) and 8 URs recording official time on electronic spreadsheets. W e selected and reviewed information from the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2000 because it was the most recent time period for which official time information was available. We did not determine whether official time use was appropriately recorded and reported for the 1,864 URs. Using the sample of 30 URs, we assessed the recording and reporting capabilities associated with OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheet processes. For our sample, we determined whether OUTTS and the electronic spreadsheets' ""data fields"" recorded and reported official time use information.

Huse, Jr. Inspector General  Refer To:  S1J-3  From:  Larry Dye /s/ Chief of Staff Office of the Inspector General (OIG) ""Follow-up Evaluation of the Use of Official Time (OT) for Union Activities at the Social Security Administration"" (A-13-01-11005)--INFORMATION We appreciate OIG's efforts in conducting this review. Our comments on the draft report content and recommendation are attached. Staff questions may be referred to Laura Bell on extension 52636. Attachment: SSA Response  Subject:  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  C-1   COMMENTS ON THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG) ""FOLLOWUP EVALUATION OF THE USE OF OFFICIAL TIME (OT) FOR UNION ACTIVITIES AT THE SOCIAL SEURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA)"" A-13-01-11005 We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft report. Overall, we found value in the report contents and recommendation. We are also providing technical comments that should be incorporated into the final report. Recommendation 1 SSA should update its policies to comply with Federal requirements to ensure that time and attendance records are retained for 6 years. Comment We agree. The Office of Human Resources (OHR) highlighted the change in the official time (OT) documentation retention period at the March 13, 2002, monthly OT conference call. OHR also documented the change in a formal memorandum to all concerned parties, which was released on March 29, 2002. We have enclosed a copy for your information.  Technical Comments Retention Policy OIG stated in the draft report that the Agency's policy for the retention of time and attendance records should comply with Federal requirements and recommended that SSA update its policies to ensure that time and attendance records are retained for 6 years. The Agency's records retention schedules are in full compliance and agree with National Archives and Records Administration's guidelines that Time and Attendance rosters be kept for 6 years. SSA's retention schedules are maintained in the automated system referred to as OARS (""Operational and Administrative Records Schedules System"") on the SSA Digital Library (http://library.ba.ssa.gov/quicklist.htm). The problem cited in the OIG report refers to an addendum made to the ""1998 Official Time/Partnership Yearbook"" instructing supervisors of Union Representatives (UR) to maintain official time forms for a 3-year period. The final report should reflect that the Agency's retention policies are correct and that the Agency will take remedial action concerning information published in the 1998 Official Time Partnership Yearbook.  Follow-up: Use of Official Time for Union Activities At SSA (A-13-01-11005)  C-2   Other Matter After examination and comparison of the data on the 30 union reps sampled through the use of official time forms and the automated OUTTS system, we understand how OIG reached the total discrepancy of 395 hours. However, we do not believe the comparison should be identified as it is in this section. The discrepancy in the number of hours should not be portrayed as a difference, or as either under reporting or over reporting. It is incorrect to say that $11,000 in official time cost was not reported to Congress. At the very least, if the hours are reported as currently shown, the 256 hours minus the 139 hours amount to a difference of 117 hours ($4,000).

Financial audits, required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, assess whether SSA's financial statements fairly present the Agency's financial position, results of operations, and cash flow. Performance audits review the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of SSA's programs. OA also conducts short-term management and program evaluations focused on issues of concern to SSA, Congress, and the general public. Evaluations often focus on identifying and recommending ways to prevent and minimize program fraud and inefficiency.  Office of Executive Operations OEO supports the OIG by providing information resource management; systems security; and the coordination of budget, procurement, telecommunications, facilities and equipment, and human resources. In addition, this office is the focal point for the OIG's strategic planning function and the development and implementation of performance measures required by the Government Performance and Results Act. OEO is also responsible for performing internal reviews to ensure that OIG offices nationwide hold themselves to the same rigorous standards that we expect from SSA, as well as conducting investigations of OIG employees, when necessary. Finally, OEO administers OIG's public affairs, media, and interagency activities, coordinates responses to Congressional requests for information, and also communicates OIG's planned and current activities and their results to the Commissioner and Congress.  Office of Investigations The Office of Investigations (OI) conducts and coordinates investigative activity related to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of SSA programs and operations. This includes wrongdoing by applicants, beneficiaries, contractors, physicians, interpreters, representative payees, third parties, and by SSA employees in the performance of their duties. OI also conducts joint investigations with other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.  Counsel to the Inspector General The Counsel to the Inspector General provides legal advice and counsel to the Inspector General on various matters, including: 1) statutes, regulations, legislation, and policy directives governing the administration of SSA's programs; 2) investigative procedures and techniques; and 3) legal implications and conclusions to be drawn from audit and investigative material produced by the OIG. The Counsel's office also administers the civil monetary penalty program."

A Miniform is a non-sensitive portion of the Industry          and Occupation section of an actual Census Long Form with handwritten          responses to three questions.           The database is          available on CD-ROM and contains images of  6000 paper miniforms          (18,000 fields), 12,500 microfilm miniforms (37,500 fields) ,          and files containing ASCII transcriptions of the strings that were written          in the miniform fields. This database is designed for the evaluation of          optical character recognition (OCR) systems in a difficult but realistic          form-based task on binary images from microfilm.            Each miniform image          contains three fields with handwritten answers to the following questions          (Long Form Questions 28b, 29a, and 29b respectively).                              Describe the activity            performed at location where employed.             What kind of work            was this person doing?             What were this            person's most important activities or duties?                   A possible set of responses        would therefore be:                     hospital             registered nurse                        patient care                   The forms were scanned          from microfilm, yielding images of far lesser quality than forms scanned          from paper. The images are 624 by 744 pixels sampled at 78.74 pixels/cm          (200 pixels/inch). They are packed five to a file and are CCITT Group          4 compressed. Source code for image manipulation, including programs to          uncompress and unpack the images, is present on the CD-ROM. The code is          written in the C programming language and was developed on Sun workstations          running SunOS 4.1.1.*            Special Database          12 was the second of three produced in conjunction with The Second Census          Optical Character Recognition Systems Conference, and was intended for          system training. (The first, Special Database 11, contained microfilm          training data. The third, Special Database 13, contained the paper and          microfilm data used for the actual system testing).            NIST and the Bureau          of the Census sponsored the Conference, in which participants sought to          determine the state of the art of the OCR industry on a challenging, realistic          task. The results of the Conference were published in NIST Internal Report          (IR) 5452. That report is available on the Internet in PostScript form          via anonymous FTP from the server  sequoyah.ncsl.nist.gov , maintained          by NIST's Visual Image Processing Group. It is also available on request          in hardcopy form.            Special Database          12 comes with a 30-page guide that presents an overview of the Conference          and its results and documents the file formats and software.            *Specific hardware          and software products identified were used in order to adequately support          the development of the technology described in this document.

Keller and Miles E. Smid  February 1998  The Modes of Operation Validation System (MOVS) specifies the procedures involved in validating implementations of the DES and Skipjack algorithms.  It is designed to perform automated testing on Implementations Under Test (IUTs).  The MOVS consists of two categories of tests - Known Answer tests and Modes tests - which are detailed for each mode of operation.  This publication also specifies the requirements and administrative procedures to be followed by those seeking formal NIST validation of an implementation of the DES or Skipjack algorithm.    NIST SPEC PUB  800-16  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS:   A ROLE- AND PERFORMANCE-BASED MODEL  (supersedes SP 500-172)  Mark Wilson, Editor; Dorothea E. de Zafra, Sadie I. Pitcher, John D. Tressler, and John B. Ippolito  April 1998  This document is designed for use by federal agencies who develop security training and awareness courses, or for those personnel who develop information technology (IT) security training for government use.  The document emphasizes training criteria or standards, rather than fixed content of specific courses and audiences.  The emphasis on roles and results gives the training requirements flexibility, adaptability, and longevity.    NIST SPEC PUB  800-15  MINIMUM INTEROPERABILITY SPECIFICATION FOR PKI COMPONENTS (MISPC), VERSION 1  By W.E. Burr, D.F. Dodson, N.A. Nazario, and W.T. Polk  January 1998  The Minimum Interoperability Specification for PKI Components (MISPC) supports interoperability for a large-scale public key infrastructure (PKI) that issues, revokes, and manages X.509 version 3 digital signature public key certificates and version 2 certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  The MISPC supports both hierarchical and network trust models.    NISTIR  6068  REPORT ON THE TMACH EXPERIMENT  By Ellen Flahavin, Goswin Eisen, Steve Hill, Heribert Spindler, Julian Straw and Andy Webber  July 1997  This report documents the findings of a multi-national evaluation experiment, funded by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), to explore alternative approaches to security evaluation.    NIST SPEC PUB  800-14  GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR SECURING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS  By Marianne Swanson and Barbara Guttman  September 1996  This document provides a baseline that organizations can use to establish and review their information technology (IT) security programs.

These         entities invest resources into the Center and have not         received clear documentation as to their use. This has been a major         system flaw across Washington State.                      Tri                   County                   Workforce Development Area has been using the  WorkSource Tracking System (WTS). Their         Executive Director agreed to share the system with all WDC's in WA. The         system has Washington Workforce Association & the Employment Security endorsement.                               The NW Partnership is         the first area to implement the system since its original development.           The system will be implemented in each certified Center in the         Northwest.           WorkSource Whatcom is         launching WTS  December 16, 2002.                               A database is created         for each WorkSource site. Staff users are designated at each site with password access to the database.                                          Currently WorkSource         Whatcom is creating         records for all WorkSource Visitors – data elements collected include:         First Name, Last Name, and Social Security Number.                    The system has the         capacity to collect more data (contact info., triage questions, demographics) on customers         but we will start as simple as possible.           Staff can view reports by customer to see their activities over a         period of time.                    WorkSource Whatcom         staff received training .   Customers         are ready, many have already received membership cards .           Oliver is the WTS         Office Administrator who will do troubleshooting, create cards, and provide         information to customers.                    This new system is an easy way         for customers to log in.          There is a touch screen Kiosk at the entry to Center.          Customers can swipe their card or enter membership number (SS#)         manually.          The system recognizes the customer and shows the daily events to choose         from. The customer selects activities for visit (clerical staff will         enter daily events into system) .           Each PC in the lobby         has a membership card reader. Customers can go directly to a PC         workstation, streamlining customer flow.                     The customer hits the green         key after signing in to access programs. Tour of Services, Service         Categories, Comment Card, and CATS are links from the Start menu.                               There should be minimal         customer         training needed on the tool. It was designed in a logical format for         simple, easy navigation.                                        The membership card is         issued on the first physical visit to a  WorkSource                   Center (whether visit is to access resources or attend a         workshop).  Resource Specialists make cards for customers entering         the lobby. Workshop/Orientation Facilitators collect information from         customers          at start of class. Clerical staff produce cards and return to training         room.                  Accuracy is essential when creating cards.                               Customers do not have         to have a card with them. They can enter their membership number         manually as long as they have been registered into the system.                     If a customer goes from         one center to another they may be already registered and not need to be         entered. Registration is web based. If a customer is already registered         in the system a comment will pop up that lets staff know that a record         has already been developed.                               Membership system is         designed to be compatible with SKIES, but that is not likely for some         time.            In two days, nearly 200         people have been issued cards. So far WorkSource is getting good         reactions from customers. Customers have been very positive when they         learn about improvements.                                FUTURE ACTION:                                Customize data         collected -                                                          Would like to be             able to identify what programs our visitors are involved in.                                                Assist partner             investment – knowing how many of their customers are using the             Centers.                                                        CUT’s quarterly             summit meetings are a good place to analyze             data and develop recommendations for WTS improvements.                                         ACTION:   Quarterly         CUT  Summit          –  add reviewing WTS as an ongoing agenda item.           Note:  Center         Use Team's may reach out for support on issues that other teams,         workgroups, or individuals have specialty (i.e.- CQI).                                     Tour       of Services         Gary Smith                    Angella Henry (Mt.         Vernon WDC) worked days, nights, and weekends to have the Tour of         Services ready for this meeting. It is not yet ready. A complex project,         the intensity was originally underestimated. Those who have had the         chance to watch Angella work and see pieces of the work are impressed with the potential for this tool. Another challenge is         battling a learning curve of using new software to create this tool.                               The Tour of         Services is a multimedia presentation to get  reliable, consistent information out on         resources and services available through the WorkSource System.                                                Media includes:             audio, video, graphic, text, html, & closed captioning.                           This structure             appeals to all learning styles.                           This tool meets             quality standards for consistency of information, correct, and             comprehensive information.

Plan to have         professionally done soon.          Fully expect it to become a nationally recognized product.

Recognition given, as a starting organization, for the support and communication and resource       assistance the Skagit Career Center has provided them.                                 Marijo requested suggestions       from Partnership on additional services/workshops to be able to provide.                                 Response:                 Each Career Center has a       small business sub-library. The Business Resource Center is an excellent       place to refer customers for more in depth research and resources.

The event priority is to get the 13 new Board members       grounded in the work.    New Board       members represent business sector.                                Industry Sectors        Healthy economies are       built by strong sectors, in urban areas there are more industry clusters.       Smaller businesses support the major business and form industry clusters.       A skilled Workforce is directly related to their success. NW Region is primarily       comprised of small businesses- under 50 employees.                 Need to ensure the       validity of formal training - that the outcome of the training are high skill, high wage jobs. We       get information about what training is needed by going directly to employers who will       hire these people following training.                         During the Governor's       Economic Development Summit speech, NW Alliance for HealthCare Skills was mentioned twice as a good model.                 Regionally 3 more sectors       have been identified to examine for a similar focus:                                      Manufacturing                                       Construction                                       Information Technology                                         Regional Economic       Summit 11/21/02         Excellent participation       from the Community & Technical       Colleges .

Among the needs are, Business Services, Information       Technology, Construction, and Education.                 The WDC's current strength       lies in active partnership with workforce development partners.                               WDC will use the       HealthCare model       and apply to these other sectors – creating a qualified workforce to       meet business customers needs.                                 This area does not have       other strong identifiable industry sectors or clusters.

The option of what information to share is now given to employers.

IDEA:                                                 One-stop's should have on hand           the job descriptions for the top 30 occupations in an area so that           employers have a starting kit. It will be faster and more convenient           for employers    (O’Net to get skill list).

These were conducted at WorkSource Whatcom for a       period of time for a 100% sample. Focus Groups are  another tool.                This is 4 data collection tools .       By comparing the results and seeing the similar trends it tells us that       the data  is  representational.                         Number of cards received is       roughly consistent by quarter. The transition from Paper to e-cards is an interesting       trend.         Good, valid data. Similar results despite the method of collection.                          Customer feedback is positive – almost exclusively it is in the good to excellent range.                With more data history       (couple years worth) we       are able to do better trending comparisons over time.                         Satisfaction dips may coincide with the unemployment rate .       CQI examining the correlation.                Excellent work by Don       Walker       on the statistical preparation!                         Currently the DAIT is       only seeing the aggregate quantitative data. There is also a lot of        qualitative feedback.       CQI trends those comments around clusters. When it stops being anecdotal,       then a focus group will be held to get more feedback from customers .       FYI - Feedback can be broken out by       county, or site.         Next Agenda:         How we use data to make       system improvements.                  FYI -  Skagit       Career Center has turned in certification application – certification team will meet       later this month to review.                              Benchmarking       – One Stop Study        Kathy Kerkvliet                 A n excellent       presentation on Benchmarking for One-Stops was presented at the DOL       Regional One-Stop Conference this summer.  Kathy K. presented the DAIT with a       worksheet developed from the study's on Essential Elements of a       One-Stop. A nationwide study was conducted to discover and document the       common traits of a successful One-Stop.         Not benchmarking here       today. The study is the benchmark. We are using those results to examine       our system. Gap analysis.                         Decision:          'Benchmarking One-Stop Centers- Understanding Keys to Success' is a good product.       It will be a valuable tool for systemic self assessment       & creation of an action plan for each criteria.                  Task:                 Facilitator's and CQI decide how to proceed with this work.                 Q’s for system– are we looking       at each of the factors? Is it evidenced       consistently across the system vs. sites?                          Feedback                         Feedback from new and       visiting staff :                                       The meeting was           entirely different from       expectations.            Dreams of gathering more information and       will be doing follow up calls on specific information needed .           Original expectation was that this group would be working collectively on one specific thing –           seemed more informational today .                       Big learning process.       Instead of clarifying matters some things got muddled – overwhelming       information                               Amazing to witness work       that has been done in this team and others. To observe the process.                                    Amazed at amount of       information – that is a positive.    Every class or workshop I       attend I get pointed to a direction to get more information .            Good to see the big       picture                                           Blown away by sticking to       the customer service focus and getting feedback. Has worked for an agency       who did not make certification and was unmotivated.            See how the Partnership       is a reality by practicing what we talk about.            Partnership is where       agencies intersect – part of initial training but getting to see it in       real life . Good seeing Kathy’s       presentation, everyone creatively expressed their initial reactions to a       product and worked their way to a common understanding .   Really enjoyed the day                                           Been to other meetings. I       am new but not so new. Met new people                                       Good to see the partner       interactions you could not tell looking around the table who works for       what agency                                 General        Comments:                                       Waiting for discussion of       competencies – not just – where it is now – didn’t get a chance to       share how we got where we got.    Why       we left the original competencies.                                       Been a long day.

Doing a lot of listening.                                       Did not get as far in the benchmarking thing – would like to start it       first in the morning when we are all fresh and energized. See the       PowerPoint after lunch.                                       Appreciate the summary       – good to look back and see what we have accomplished during the year.                                       Benchmarking all by       itself – big deal. Whidbey is talking a lot about benchmarks – This       will be valuable in a lot of people's work.                                       Enjoyed presentation       about desktop – everyone on the work teams deserves a lot of kudos, will       be helpful as a Resource Specialist. Would have been nice to have after lunch. Can hardly       wait to see the Tour Of Services.                                        Benchmarking conversation       was left hanging – not sure where to go with the materials from here. It       disappeared from table without any conversation. Do we need to do       anything? (It will be brought to the next meeting)                                 Next       Meeting                         March 13,       2003                 Draft Agenda:                                                Business customer comment card results                                 How we use data to make       system improvements.

GX234-20-11679992	"Guide to Certifying One-Stop Operators  For use by Local Workforce Investment Boards  April, 2001  Produced by  NYS Department of Labor  in consulation with  New York State Workforce Investment Board     INTRODUCTION    As provided in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, the Local Workforce Investment Board, with the agreement of the chief elected official, must designate and certify One-Stop Operators in each local area.  Certification will help ensure a consistent level of quality in the services provided in the local workforce investment area.  Local Boards are charged with utilizing criteria and quality standards for the purpose of holding Operators accountable for the one-stop system or center(s) operations they oversee.   New York State strives to establish a quality-driven, comprehensive system of workforce development services, and access to services, that benefit all New York citizens who wish to take advantage of them. One way this can be accomplished is through a systemic approach in the development of one-stop operator quality standards and measures of excellence that can be flexibly applied on the local level. The State Workforce Investment Board will ensure consistency of quality across New York States one-stop system by establishing a State-level certification of local One-Stop System and Center Operators.  Achievement of State-level certification will allow local Operators to benefit from the WorkforceNY statewide one-stop logo and marketing campaign and promotional materials.  This branding of New Yorks one-stop system will identify local systems and centers who have attained State certification as those that have met the highest quality standards for the provision of workforce development services in their community.  State certified Operators will enjoy the benefits of brand recognition and will be able to easily customize marketing products to add their own area/center moniker and logo.    PURPOSE OF THE CERTIFICATION GUIDE    This Guide outlines the critical elements that should be considered when developing a local One-Stop Operator Certification process.  The Guide also points out specific areas of concentration the State Workforce Investment Board will consider in awarding State Certification to local One-Stop System or Center Operators.   Included in the Guide are examples of other chartering or certification processes used around the country from which you may wish to borrow.  Many of the examples establish different levels of certification for the full-service one-stops and minimum certification criteria for affiliate or satellite one-stops. It is strictly up to the local Board which model will be used or whether to develop a new one.   Consistent with the spirit of the Workforce Investment Act, and the beliefs of the State Workforce Investment Board, all of the examples included in the Appendix  incorporate seven quality and continuous improvement criteria.  These criteria are commonly utilized by public entities and private sector corporations as a way to assess an organizations strengths and opportunities for improvement.  They are also the basis by which New York States quality award organization, The Empire State Advantage: Excellence at Work, judges organizational excellence. Many of the criteria are easily adaptable to the workforce development arena (see the Excellence in One-Stops Guidebook, pages 15-16 and the Boston and Pennsylvania examples).  The seven categories are:      Leadership :  How the organizations senior leaders address values, performance expectations, a focus on customers and other stakeholders, empowerment, innovation, learning and organizational directions.    Strategic Planning : Examines the organizations process of developing strategic objectives, as well as creating action plans and related human resource plans to support organizational direction.    Customer and Market Focus : Examines how the organization determines customer/market requirements, expectations and preferences.  Also examines how the organization builds relationships with customers and determines their satisfaction.    Information and Analysis : Examines the performance management system and how the organization analyzes performance data and information.    Human Resource Focus : Examines how the organization enables employees to develop and utilize their full potential in alignment with the organizations objectives.  Also examines efforts to build and maintain a work environment and employee support climate conducive to performance excellence, full participation and personal and organizational growth.    Process Management : Examines key aspects of process management, including customer-focused design of products and service delivery, as well as support, supplier and partnering processes involving all work units.  Also includes how key processes are designed, managed and improved to achieve better performance.    Business Results : Examines the organizations performance and improvement in key business areas  customer satisfaction, financial and marketplace performance, product and service performance, human resource results, supplier and partner results, and operational performance.  Also examines performance levels relative to other organizations within the system providing similar services.     LOCAL CERTIFICATION    Each local WIB must establish a one-stop operator certification process prior to applying for State level certification. In addition, the local WIB must have a written agreement in place with each one-stop operator in the local system.  This written agreement provides a basis for accountability, clarity of roles and responsibilities, and promotes inclusion of partners and integration of services. Consistent with the WIA principles of universal access, customer choice, increased accountability, and strong private sector involvement, the local certification process should also advance quality improvement methods, customer satisfaction measures, and staff development.    SUGGESTED ELEMENTS    Listed below are basic elements of certification you may want to include in your local standards. In reviewing the list below, please note that it is not the States intention that local areas duplicate existing documentation or processes for the purpose of certification.  For instance, a business plan may already exist within the local plan. In that case, it should not be reinvented, but reviewed to ensure it contains all necessary components.  The list below is not all-inclusive; examples of other items you may want to include are the establishment of business units in each One-Stop Center or the use of a standardized customer feedback process. Refer to the Appendix for examples of additional certification criteria applied by other entities.      Self-Assessment (based on the seven continuous improvement categories noted previously)    Gauges readiness as one-stop operator  Identifies improvement opportunities and service gaps  Uncovers possible resource needs  Strengthens organization by utilizing teamwork   Required Elements Checklist    Are mandatory partners included?  Are core services available?  Access to intensive services and training?  Are signed MOUs and cost allocation plans in place?   Business Plan Components  Mission/Vision  Operating Principles  Organizational Chart  Financial Plan  Performance Goals and Standards  Customer Service Plans (Employer and Job Seeker)  Customer Feedback Plan/Satisfaction Indicators  Technology Plan  Staffing and Staff Development Plan  Continuous Improvement Plan  Facilities Plan     ON-SITE REVIEW    The on-site review is an essential component of any certification process.  This review gives the local Board an opportunity to validate information provided in the Operators application and ask questions that may arise after review of the written material. Conversely, the Operator is provided with an additional chance to supply information, clarify specific points, or ask questions the Operator may have about the Boards expectations. Combined with the written application, an on-site review provides the local Board with additional insight as to the Operators readiness for certification.   Local Boards must ensure that members of the review team are appropriately trained and qualified to evaluate applicants against the established local certification standards.  Notice should be given to applicants prior to the on-site review indicating date and time of visit, names of review team members and the organizations they represent, and specific topic areas that will be covered.  Once the review is completed, a written feedback report should be forwarded to the applicant.  The Workforce Excellence Network publication Excellence in One-Stops Guidebook includes additional information about conducting local on-site reviews.    ONE-STOP OPERATOR AGREEMENT    Once local certification has been awarded, the Local WIB must enter into a written agreement with each certified One-Stop Operator.  At a minimum, this agreement should include the following:      Parties to the Agreement  Duration of Agreement  Definition of Roles/Responsibilities of Each Party  Mission/Vision of Local System  Performance Standards/Outcomes  Oversight and Review Schedule  Description of Technical Assistance Available  Reporting Requirements  Breach of Agreement  Modification of Agreement  Process for Re-Certification    This document should be flexible so that it can be reviewed and updated as necessary during the course of the agreement period.    ELEMENTS OF STATE CERTIFICATION    State level certification will use the locally developed quality standards and criteria as its foundation.  In addition to a paper review, State-level site visit teams will be dispatched to verify required elements, partner involvement, service integration and other quality indicators.  If any elements are missing or found to be inadequate, feedback and technical assistance will be provided to bring the operator up to the level required for State certification.  Once State certification has been achieved, it will be valid for two years from the date of award.  Local WIBs may apply for recertification on behalf of their operators six months prior to expiration. Listed below are the steps involved in achieving State-level certification.        Step 1: The Local WIB develops a written One-Stop Operator certification process and submits it to the NYS Department of Labor as staff to the State WIB.  The local certification process may be transmitted for review prior to OR at the time of application for State certification of the local One-Stop System/Center Operator(s).  Technical assistance will be provided as requested.     Step 2: The Local WIB submits an application for State certification of locally certified One-Stop System/Center Operator(s) to:    Ms. Margaret M. Moree  Workforce Development and Training  NYS Department of Labor  State Campus, Building 12, Room 450  Albany, New York 12240    Applications will be accepted on a continuous basis and may be submitted for individual One-Stop Center Operators as they become locally certified or may be submitted for a One-Stop System Operator overseeing more than one One-Stop Center.  In either case, all One-Stop Centers under the responsibility of the One-Stop Operator must be locally certified prior to submitting an application for State certification.   The application package must include:      copy of local certification process (unless previously submitted)  completed State certification application form  signed Attestation page asserting that One-Stop Operators have met local criteria  signed Non-Compliance Policy stating local WIB Chair has read and understands consequences of non-compliance  copy of local WIB/One-Stop Operator Agreement     Step 3: Once an application has been reviewed, a site visit will be scheduled to include members of the local Board, the One-Stop Operator and other individuals as appropriate.  Site visits will be conducted by a team consisting of staff to the State Board and state agency workforce development partners.  Generally, site visits will cover the areas listed below; however, more specific information will be given prior to the actual visit:      Customer flow  Administrative systems  Service and resource integration  Information technology systems  Business services  Quantitative and qualitative measures  Financial systems  Facility     Step 4: The site visit team will provide written feedback to the local WIB which will result in either Certification or provision of technical assistance.     Step 5: The site visit team will make annual visits to assist the local WIB in identifying improvement opportunities, training and technical assistance needs. These visits will be prearranged with local WIB Chairs.  In addition, unannounced, ""secret shopper"" visits will take place randomly during the term of certification in order to gauge performance from a customers point of view.  Local WIB Chairs will receive a written feedback report after both the pre-arranged visits and the secret shopper visits. Additional details will be distributed to Local Board Chairs regarding how the secret shopper reviews will be conducted, the components the shoppers will focus on, and the evaluation process that will be used.     Step 6: A local WIB may apply for recertification of its system/center operator(s) six months prior to expiration of State certification.  Local WIBs must ensure that all operators seeking recertification have continued to meet or exceed the local level certification criteria.

Skagit Literacy matches         volunteers to tutor low-literacy individuals – perhaps the Center can provide         training on use of tool for those volunteers.                                           Need to make a clear         sort between services,         information, links                               Desktop         Focus Group  at WorkSource Whatcom          Kathy Haven                               Members of CQI         Team:  Mike R.,         Kathy H.,  Kathy K.,  Malinda B., Don W., Brian H.,          Jim O., Gary S.                     14 Customers participated         in focus group.          It was a good random sample.   Some signed up ahead of         time, some were spontaneously invited, some recruited from Job         Club .            The Menu of Services was         provided on all the PC's in the         Computer Lab . Customers were given a very brief introduction         and allowed to explore for 15 minutes without much conversation. Then,         pointed questions were asked about their experience with the tool.                    All the Customers loved         it. They were all positive and enthusiastic  – even before pizza .

Overall a         fantastic focus group. Participants expressed having enjoyed the         experience and are willing to be contacted for future focus groups.         Valuable feedback was received.                     At this time the         product will be implemented ONLY in WorkSource Center's. Product is         hosted on each site server         – it links to software only available at the Center.                      Goal to have a similar         directional aid online to be accessed from homes.                                      Q:   Where is CATS         system?           CATS WorkFirst Client         tracking system is accessed directly through the Start Menu.                      Recognition          to all staff who contributed to the creation of this product. A  HUGE  amount of work         went into this. In all the design, content, and mechanics.

JOB WELL DONE!!!                                      WorkSource       Membership System Implementation                   G ary Smith                   To date we have not had         a system to effectively provide consistent and accurate Center usage         data to our WorkSource System Partners and Stakeholders. These         entities invest resources into the Center and have not         received clear documentation as to their use. This has been a major         system flaw across Washington State.                      Tri                   County                   Workforce Development Area has been using the  WorkSource Tracking System (WTS). Their         Executive Director agreed to share the system with all WDC's in WA. The         system has Washington Workforce Association & the Employment Security endorsement.                               The NW Partnership is         the first area to implement the system since its original development.           The system will be implemented in each certified Center in the         Northwest.           WorkSource Whatcom is         launching WTS  December 16, 2002.                               A database is created         for each WorkSource site. Staff users are designated at each site with password access to the database.                                          Currently WorkSource         Whatcom is creating         records for all WorkSource Visitors – data elements collected include:         First Name, Last Name, and Social Security Number.                    The system has the         capacity to collect more data (contact info., triage questions, demographics) on customers         but we will start as simple as possible.           Staff can view reports by customer to see their activities over a         period of time.                    WorkSource Whatcom         staff received training .   Customers         are ready, many have already received membership cards .           Oliver is the WTS         Office Administrator who will do troubleshooting, create cards, and provide         information to customers.                    This new system is an easy way         for customers to log in.          There is a touch screen Kiosk at the entry to Center.          Customers can swipe their card or enter membership number (SS#)         manually.          The system recognizes the customer and shows the daily events to choose         from. The customer selects activities for visit (clerical staff will         enter daily events into system) .           Each PC in the lobby         has a membership card reader. Customers can go directly to a PC         workstation, streamlining customer flow.                     The customer hits the green         key after signing in to access programs. Tour of Services, Service         Categories, Comment Card, and CATS are links from the Start menu.                               There should be minimal         customer         training needed on the tool. It was designed in a logical format for         simple, easy navigation.                                        The membership card is         issued on the first physical visit to a  WorkSource                   Center (whether visit is to access resources or attend a         workshop).  Resource Specialists make cards for customers entering         the lobby. Workshop/Orientation Facilitators collect information from         customers          at start of class. Clerical staff produce cards and return to training         room.                  Accuracy is essential when creating cards.                               Customers do not have         to have a card with them. They can enter their membership number         manually as long as they have been registered into the system.                     If a customer goes from         one center to another they may be already registered and not need to be         entered. Registration is web based. If a customer is already registered         in the system a comment will pop up that lets staff know that a record         has already been developed.                               Membership system is         designed to be compatible with SKIES, but that is not likely for some         time.            In two days, nearly 200         people have been issued cards. So far WorkSource is getting good         reactions from customers. Customers have been very positive when they         learn about improvements.

Tour       of Services         Gary Smith                    Angella Henry (Mt.         Vernon WDC) worked days, nights, and weekends to have the Tour of         Services ready for this meeting. It is not yet ready. A complex project,         the intensity was originally underestimated. Those who have had the         chance to watch Angella work and see pieces of the work are impressed with the potential for this tool. Another challenge is         battling a learning curve of using new software to create this tool.                               The Tour of         Services is a multimedia presentation to get  reliable, consistent information out on         resources and services available through the WorkSource System.                                                Media includes:             audio, video, graphic, text, html, & closed captioning.                           This structure             appeals to all learning styles.                           This tool meets             quality standards for consistency of information, correct, and             comprehensive information.

Plan to have         professionally done soon.          Fully expect it to become a nationally recognized product.

Performance,  presented on customer service- FISH video. In a side       conversation he mentioned that his office was pursuing a pilot project of       an online staff competencies development tool. The Partnership has been       doing a lot of work through the last year to create standards and       competency expectations for staff. Work is around performance enhancement.         Created competencies, indicators, and measures.  This online learning       tool is hoped to provide the content knowledge of staff to meet our       'Competencies for Workforce Development Professionals.'                 We now have 18       participants from 4 partners involved in the pilot of the online       competency tool. There is a total of 14 modules –  to be completed       at a rate of 1 per week. Learning stage. There is Pre and post testing to       identify changes.

Industry Sectors        Healthy economies are       built by strong sectors, in urban areas there are more industry clusters.       Smaller businesses support the major business and form industry clusters.       A skilled Workforce is directly related to their success. NW Region is primarily       comprised of small businesses- under 50 employees.                 Need to ensure the       validity of formal training - that the outcome of the training are high skill, high wage jobs. We       get information about what training is needed by going directly to employers who will       hire these people following training.                         During the Governor's       Economic Development Summit speech, NW Alliance for HealthCare Skills was mentioned twice as a good model.

The WDC's current strength       lies in active partnership with workforce development partners.                               WDC will use the       HealthCare model       and apply to these other sectors – creating a qualified workforce to       meet business customers needs.

By comparing the results and seeing the similar trends it tells us that       the data  is  representational.                         Number of cards received is       roughly consistent by quarter. The transition from Paper to e-cards is an interesting       trend.         Good, valid data. Similar results despite the method of collection.                          Customer feedback is positive – almost exclusively it is in the good to excellent range.                With more data history       (couple years worth) we       are able to do better trending comparisons over time.

Excellent work by Don       Walker       on the statistical preparation!                         Currently the DAIT is       only seeing the aggregate quantitative data. There is also a lot of        qualitative feedback.       CQI trends those comments around clusters. When it stops being anecdotal,       then a focus group will be held to get more feedback from customers .       FYI - Feedback can be broken out by       county, or site.

Feedback                         Feedback from new and       visiting staff :                                       The meeting was           entirely different from       expectations.            Dreams of gathering more information and       will be doing follow up calls on specific information needed .           Original expectation was that this group would be working collectively on one specific thing –           seemed more informational today .                       Big learning process.       Instead of clarifying matters some things got muddled – overwhelming       information                               Amazing to witness work       that has been done in this team and others. To observe the process.                                    Amazed at amount of       information – that is a positive.    Every class or workshop I       attend I get pointed to a direction to get more information .            Good to see the big       picture                                           Blown away by sticking to       the customer service focus and getting feedback. Has worked for an agency       who did not make certification and was unmotivated.            See how the Partnership       is a reality by practicing what we talk about.            Partnership is where       agencies intersect – part of initial training but getting to see it in       real life . Good seeing Kathy’s       presentation, everyone creatively expressed their initial reactions to a       product and worked their way to a common understanding .   Really enjoyed the day                                           Been to other meetings. I       am new but not so new. Met new people                                       Good to see the partner       interactions you could not tell looking around the table who works for       what agency                                 General        Comments:                                       Waiting for discussion of       competencies – not just – where it is now – didn’t get a chance to       share how we got where we got.    Why       we left the original competencies.                                       Been a long day.                                       Facility did not work       really well            (parking is an issue)                               Really good                                       Skagit                Career                Center                now has a big room available for meetings                                       Felt to me like it was a       lot of information out – reporting – have been spending more time to       build and create so this was different than the kind of meetings that we       have been having lately. Doing a lot of listening.                                       Did not get as far in the benchmarking thing – would like to start it       first in the morning when we are all fresh and energized. See the       PowerPoint after lunch.                                       Appreciate the summary       – good to look back and see what we have accomplished during the year.                                       Benchmarking all by       itself – big deal. Whidbey is talking a lot about benchmarks – This       will be valuable in a lot of people's work.                                       Enjoyed presentation       about desktop – everyone on the work teams deserves a lot of kudos, will       be helpful as a Resource Specialist. Would have been nice to have after lunch. Can hardly       wait to see the Tour Of Services.                                        Benchmarking conversation       was left hanging – not sure where to go with the materials from here. It       disappeared from table without any conversation. Do we need to do       anything? (It will be brought to the next meeting)                                 Next       Meeting                         March 13,       2003                 Draft Agenda:                                                Business customer comment card results                                 How we use data to make       system improvements.                                             Essential Elements in           a One-Stop - conversation on next steps                                 Tour of Services"
